## Intro Notebooks

These notebooks are based on the notebooks by Jake Vanderplas. We have
adapted them in various ways, of which the most important are:

- removed some of the more in-depth, theoretical explanations that are
  not really necessary in the context of introductory notebooks;
  
- added QuickCheck (QC) cells throughout the notebooks;

- added Questions (Q) at the end of the notebooks to challenge the
  participants to use the acquired knowledge.
