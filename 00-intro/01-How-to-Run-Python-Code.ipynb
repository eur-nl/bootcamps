    "This means that it is executed line by line, which allows programming to be interactive in a way that is not directly possible with compiled languages like Fortran, C, or Java. This section will describe four primary ways you can run Python code: the *Python interpreter*, the *IPython interpreter*, via *Self-contained Scripts*, or in the *Jupyter notebook* (which is the thing that you are looking at now!)."

    "\n",
    "- Input: Get data from the keyboard, files, network, or any other device\n",
    "- Ouput: Display the data on a screen, write it to file, send it over a network\n",
    "- Math: Perform mathematical operations\n",
    "- Conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and run the code appropriate for these conditions\n",
    "- Repeat: Perform actions over and over again, with some variation\n",
    "\n",
    "Even huge programs are build out of these simple building blocks. But because you are almost always confronted with the end result, a large and complicated program, what you see is a large and complex thing, and almost never the intermediate stages. Getting accustomed to breaking up tasks into smaller subtasks and solving these one by one is an important exra goal of this workshop."
