# Intro

The last workshop (May 2019) was well received. We used Googles Colab
as the central hub for the notebooks. Zero setup, worked well.

We used Jake Vanderplas "Whirlwind Tour of Python" as the skeleton for
our notebooks. Although this worked ok, we noticed some clear
drawbacks:

- often too much information crammed in and occasionally some exotic
  topics mixed in. In short, a little too much, too staccato;
- there were not enough exercises available for the participants,
  making the first observation even a bit more severe;
- the contents were a bit too repetitive and factual, a bit like: With
  this under the belt, one can start programming.
  
So, the question is: how to introduce the various elements of
programming in Python given the fact that we want to start
programming, doing small exercises throughout combined with larger
case studies, right from the start.

Allen Downey's "Think Python", freely available on the web, uses
precisely this idea: Keeping it short and focus on programming and
debugging (instead of the programming language).

In order to keep things shorter still, more suited for our two-day
workshop, we decided to project the contents of "Think Python" on the
skeleton of the canonical programming book: The C programming language
by Kernighan and Ritchie.

If participants want to explore certain topics in more depth, they can
easily do so, the 
complete book is freely available.
