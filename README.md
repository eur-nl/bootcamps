Python bootcamps (EUR)
===

This Git repository contains the Jupyter notebooks (to be) used for
the workshops "Basic Lab Skills for Research Computing" at the Erasmus
University Rotterdam.

At present we are working on three workshops:

  - CLI, MarkDown, LaTeX, Pandoc, Git, CSV, textanalysis, intro
    Jupyter notebooks
  - Python programming: Basics, textanalysis (NLTK, Spacy), data
    (Pandas)
  - SQL: SQLite, Google's BigQuery
  
Methodology
===

Basically, there exist two ways to address the lack of "computer
literacy" in academia. Teach students and teachers some tricks,
together with the use of some libraries, to get the results they are
looking for. Or, take a more fundamental approach: Teach programming
as a problem solving technique, using pseudo-code, diagrams, and
notation, based on sound software engineering principles (Touretzky,
Etter).

We have chosen the latter approach. The reasoning behind this choice
is simple. Even workshops based upon this approach will not succeed in
delivering full-fledged programmers and what participants will get out
of the workshops will differ amongst them. But the bottomline will be
that they have become better problem solvers and that they have seen
the tools to successfully communicate with programmers: pseudo-code
and notation.
  
Instruments used
===

- command line interface
- unix toolbox
- Git
- Anaconda Python distribution (Python 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebooks

Goals
===

- Understand that, in an academic context, it is important to be able
  to read, use and re-use code.
- Modular, comprehensible, re-usable and testable all come together.
- Solving problems with the computer can be fun; working together on
  solving these problems doubles the fun.
- Solving these problems should be based upon sound engineering
  principles.
