    "Hardly any flame wars between the R and Python communities. McKinney and Wickham sometimes work together closely, the fruits of which find their way into both languages. R is real strong in hard core statistical libraries and has a kind of functional twist to it and, at least for me, a bit of a quirky syntax; Python is the more broad programming language with strong support, through its libraries, for scientific programming.\n",

Or, in order to facilitate the input of data, one stores multiple variables into one column.
