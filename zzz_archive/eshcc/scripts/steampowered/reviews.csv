												Don't buy. Aimbot hackers rampant. Lack of response from SHG is killing the playerbase and concurrent online users is down.  Sledgehammer has yet to honor their promise to the PC gamers as written in their own blog on Oct 4th.""We have yet to deploy the suite of anti-cheat/hacking technology we will use when the full PC game is live. We take a level playing field extremely serious and will monitor and react to this as a top priority on an ongoing basis.""https://community.activision.com/t5/Sledgehammer-Games/Call-of-Duty-WWII-Multiplayer-PC-Open-Beta-Info/ba-p/10427763Latest patch 12/8 added snow, Microtransaction loot crates and Holiday Lights.

												It's true when people said that no matter how bad the reviews are people are going to buy Call of Duty anyway. Well shiit I'm one of that and regret terribly. The PC version of this game is just a Triple A mess. Hackers, performance and connection issues are still persist. I am a dumbass and I hope to Buddha, Allah and Jesus that I will learn. If any of you are thinking about buying this game please DO NOT put yourself in such discomfort."

												It's not a terrible surprise that this gets a negative review.  However, there are some caveats that make it worth it on a significant discount.Namely, that caveat is the single player, which is fairly serviceable.  The story is predictable (beyond the Allies winning WW2), but it does enough to keep you engaged throughout the six-ish hour playthrough.  What really kept me playing were the varied locales and different types of gameplay.  You'll be put in action sequences on foot and in a turret, as well as stealth missions, espionage missions, and so on.  Really, the one weak part here were the vehicle portions, due to the very clunky controls for them.  However, there's enough variety to get you through the game.  Tack on the fact that the game looks fairly decent, ran stable enough (only 1 crash), and well-hidden collectables to find for replay value, and you have a single player game that is worth a go at the right price.However, this game is $60 minimum, and a six hour single player game at that price doesn't usually cut it for me -- which is why any CoD since 2007 has always found its value in its multiplayer.  That being said, sadly, this is where CoD WW2 falls woefully short.  I genuinely tried to come into this game at launch with an open mind.  I play an unhealthy amount of CoD4, MW2, WaW, etc, so it's easy to fall into hater mode over the newer CoDs.  And while I found some fun at certain portions of my time with the multiplayer, the more I played it, the more I noticed all the nonsense this game threw at me.For starters, 9 maps is woefully pitiful for a CoD MP.  To put into perspective, MW2 had 16 maps at launch.  And most of the maps in WW2 are poorly designed, poorly optimized, or both -- Gustav Cannon being the main culprit.  That map, for example, is so bad that it bogs my PC (1080ti and i7 4790k) down to as low as 70fps on lower video settings.  That is inexcusable.  Other maps have similar issues (London Docks, USS Texas), but they're admittedly not as pronounced as on Gustav Cannon.  Add in the poor map design, with far too many sightlines and zero flow, and the lack of maps become even more an issue.The optimization is objectively worse than the single player portion of the game.  I got frequent crashes, basic settings in the options menu would reset every time I closed the game down, some of my custom gun loadouts would reset after every match used, sounds are pitiful (to the point where there's no point of reference of where your enemies are coming from), netcode and matchmaking are still unbelievablely cryptic at best, guns are poorly balanced (the KAR is the best shotgun!  the BAR is the best SMG!), and the issues go on and on and so on...You can disagree with me about anything of the above.  You can have your opinion about what guns are under/overpowered, or if the matchmaking or maps are good enough.  You can have better luck with running this game than I do.  I can respect that, that's what makes most of these reviews subjective.  What is FACT, and the absolute backbreaker of this game's multiplayer, is the rampant cheating.  This game's so vulnerable to cheating, it was rampant less than 2 full days INTO THE BETA.  And while the launch was cheater-free for the most part, they've come back, and there just doesn't seem to be any serious initiative to crack down on this to date.  From an objective point of view, no matter if I like this game or not, I cannot recommend anyone this game in its current state.One disclaimer, I have never played any Zombies mode ever, and that includes this game.  I cannot comment on the state of that portion of the game, as I cannot review things I haven't played.The silver lining to this game's abysmal multiplayer is the serviceable singleplayer story mode.  If this game is ever severely discounted, I can maybe recommend this.  However, judging by the price points of earlier CoDs (Black Ops 2 is STILL $60, Black Ops 1 is from 2010 and still $40, etc), I don't see a reasonable price reduction on this game anytime soon.There's simply far too many games out today for me to care about sub-par games like this, Call of Duty or not.  Pass."

												I played Single Player mode for 15 hours...which only would have taken about 7 if my save games hadn't been deleted every time the game crashed. I played through the first five missions 4 separate times due to this.Not enjoyable.Historical and military accuracy were terrible. Russian sub-machine guns in Western Europe? PVTs continually calling a Tech Sergeant ""Sir"" without getting chewed out? Many, many German uniform screw-ups (all officers won the Iron Cross, apparently). I'm not talking about black or female soldiers, but the rest is laughable."

												Good story, but very poorly implemented. As early as the normandy beach scene you see artillery fall around you, but no change to the terrain. Bad company 1 on the 360... 9 years ago... in 2008, had destructable environments... but apparently COD can't figure that out. Once on the coast, you'll watch half a german batallion run at you with no regard for tactics. They seem mindless. In a later mission, after you clear an area and kill a tank, you'll watch enemies come out of nowhere, bearing down on you, firing full auto. When you know they'd run out of ammo after 3s, and they're still firing... after 6s... 7s, 8s.. No staggered fire, just full auto continuously. It's not dramatic, it's annoying. Don't insult your audience's intelligence. They're walking in the open too after you just obliterated all their friends. They'd be afraid or smart enough to advance cautiously.Watching a mechanically actuated flak gun move as fast as you can turn your mouse is also just wrong... even modern guns don't turn that fast. Albeit much faster than a flak would turn with a hand crank. At one point I was half way down the stairs after I saw a tank; leaving a sniper tower... and the cutscene put me back atop the tower on the completely opposite side of where I was, falling off the side. And the number of times my legs should have been blown off by nearby explosions.. You get thrown in the air at one point, but apparently take no damage besides a mild headache. Shrapnel from artillery would chew you to shreads too, but apparently you're superman.Flying a plane with your mouse is also brutal, developers should try hawx or ace combat; use W or S for pitch and make movement flow. The controls don't feel natural. The tank should have completely independent controls for turret and body too. I shouldn't continuously have to force the body to turn to keep straight while shooting sideways. The body will always try to turn towards your mouse and it's extremely frustrating. Maybe it's fixed in consoles. If so, the issue lies with lack of consideration, thought, or time for the PC port controls, but I suspect the development team had either too little time, or no idea what they were doing. Controls in the last COD game (infinite warfare) were very well done, but that was a different team. The vehicle sequences in gernal, all of them, were garbage.. if you're going the same speed as another car and they're shooting at you, every shot would connect. And migrating hilly terrain that would clear impact or flip a car at very high speeds is ridiculous. Vehicles in this game are terrible.The hero moments were irritating too. Countless times, you'll be dragging a friendly, but he'll die behind cover because it wasn't one particular piece of cover. And it's the same voice actor over and over..The same one line, ""i owe you my life Daniels blah blah blah."" By the end of the game you want to shoot the idiot for being so incopetent. I started ignoring the hero moments because it annoyed me so much.The game also tries to paint Pierson in a poor light. I can't forgive his drinking, but at the same time I can understand the incredible responsilbility he feels and undestand his harshness. He's best suited to lead the mission given the other options I see. In battle he's collected and gives orders quickly, even if they're borderline suicidal e.g. calling close air support danger close. It was the right call. You don't coddle men in war. You break, they break.The AI is horriffic. Having two friendlies shoot at distance enemies when they're in arms reach of hostiles is bad coding. The AI hasn't been changed in a decade. I really feel like it's the same bots from COD 2 in the early 2000s. The engine is alright, but still dated. The PC version should also have way better graphics than the console. And if this is the case, I feel bad for the console gamers because this isn't enough given what hardware is on the market.I want to like this game, it returned to WW2, but so much is wrong with it and it really bothers me. I will give credit for the cinematics and voice acting. Those are well done. And you feel bad for your jewish-american friend Zeussman; and of course Paul.  Redd/Daniel's wife was hideous, if everyone says she's pretty, make her pretty.. The stealth was a nice addition, but it's poorly implemented. You can walk within peripheral vision of hostiles. You can't drag bodies behind cover. An alerted enemy counts as  blown even if you kill him before he shouts or shoots. Glad it's there, but it seems like an after thought. The knife kills magically changes the enemies skin texture to a generic bloodied look. No transition or animation. It looks cheap.Don't waste your money until it's $30 or cheaper. DLC really should be free. Not sure if the devs or corporate is to blame. Maybe if the developers had a longer production cycle, then the game would be longer and done better. I'd like at least 10 hours of campaign, maybe 20. But I probably got closer to 6. A specialist should have been brought in for the vehicles, someone from a racing game or flying game, something. The linear approach to missions is also painful. It feels forced when you're constantly surrounded by rock barriers, thick brush, full closets, etc. Guess it's my fault that I keep buying this garbage. Take a page from ghost recon wildlands. More open = better. Never cared for the multi-player so I do feel ripped off considering what I paid. And COD mp is the plague regardless. Hopefully nazi zombies gives it some extra life. That was the primary reason I got the game."

												Definitely not worth full retail price.   CONS:  - Campaign levels are incredibly short. 60 minutes and I had already completed 5 stages on hardened - Enemies are all deadshot, even behind cover at any difficulty (difficulty only changes the rate at which they shoot you with 100% accuracy). Hell, they are even accurate when blindfiring from cover.- Because of how accurate enemies are at any range with any weapons, mounted weapons are really fustrating to use, especially madatory mounted weapon sections where you absolutely can't dismount the weapon you are forced to use. There's no cover, and you  can't take cover . Worse still, the gun requires a somewhat lengthy reload after just 50 bullets (some uses a cooldown system).- Characters are pretty forgettable in all honestly compared to something else like Brothers in Arms, COD 2, or even Company of Heroes Tales of Valor.-  Ally. Useless (can't shoot for sheet) and annoying. Screaming ""MED PACK READY BRUH"" ""GOT YOUR AMMO BRUH"" every few seconds.- Microtransactions on a full priced AAA game. Solely cosmetics or not, just NO. - Settings between SP, MP and Zombies   DO NOT   carry over between each. So you'll have to manually set all of them again (i.e if you fine tuned your SP settings, you gotta do the same for MP and Zombie). It's a hassle.- Bugs & errors (e.g error 4128).- Hackers everywhere. Reporting them doesn't seem to help either.  PRO/CON  - Can't complaion about the visuals. It's not bad, but its nothing to rave about either. I won't go into nitpicky details on ulgy textures, but as a whole, so long as you're not going out of your way looking (i.e zooming in at a particular rock) for it, the game looks and runs just fine.- QTE. Not a fan, but not totally adverse against it either. Some QTE sequence require you to move your mouse in a circle (kinda like telltales games I guess?) and there are some variety of different buttons to press, so its not just smash X button all the time.- HP regen, I don't like it, but at the same time i don't not like it. I'm confused, it does what it does, but it doesn't feel as ""fluid"" as something from say, Dying Light, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Half Life and Halo. I'm guessing that the slow animation to heal is for balancing purposes (i.e you can't just heal in an instant) but then again, I have played game with healing animation and they don't feel as off as this. It's not bad, but its not  good  per se? Idk its hard to explain.- Enemy AI aren't exactly stupid as they know when to try to flush you out while flanking you and blindfire as you try to advance towards them, but they do really stupid things from time to time like throwing a bomb that bounced back and killed themselves or ""taking cover"" right infront of you (and the cover is facing the wrong way).- For a game that prides itself alot on ""historical accuraries"", there are sure loads of jarring historical inaccuracies, even on the very first level alone. But I'm not really complaining since some of them are beneficial, like german units using weapons they weren't suppose to have (e.g "" troops ""Sten guns"", historically speaking, german made ones were called the MP 3008, and it was avaliable ONLY for the Volksstrum, not the Wehrmacht or any branch of the military, even in desperate times. The MP 3008 was literally a really crap copy made in haste to arm fanatical civilians.)  PROS:  - Sound designs are pretty good. they feel heavy when they need to be and ambience have its moments of tranquil breaking into a furry of bullets and explosions.- Zombie and MP are okay (zombie is really good imo, had always wanted something similar to COD WoW zombies for a while now), nothing much to shine or bash on. Aside from the absolute bs that is the microtransaction (and how they've impliment that degrading patent it into COD WW2), it does what it does. Though I'll admit it is really weird seeing a negro nazi running around.- Amazing settings design for PC, wide variety with helpful screenshots to better explain what each settings does at what setting (i.e Texture at med, high, extra). Something like what you'd see at geforce.com- You cannot truly just ADS and empty the entire mag in a single burst with laser accuracy (atleast in my experience). There's a very noticable weapon spread at range even while going prone. Hipfire is pretty inaccurate aswell.- Auto presets for lefties.- Surprising range of weaponary- WW2 themed (like finally i suppose)TL;DR: It's fun, but the asking price is too high for the content avaliable (Get it for 30 USD or less). If you're buying this solely for SP, don't bother (even with discount) its incredibly short and unmemorable. The set pieces don't even feel grand or pumped (like COD WoW Downfall  or COD2 Ponte de Hoc). Now I really wish there was a ""conditional thumbs up/down"" system because I'm recommending this game, for its base game content value,  AT 30 USD OR LESS  (absolute max I'll say is 40$ and that's really pushing it). Buying the full edition that comes with the season pass and bonus map is really ludicrous for the average joe earning average wages (also if I were a parent,unless wealthy af, dropping 60$ or more on a game that isn't that content filled would make me squint at best and straight up no to buying at worse. Adding microtransaction ontop of that doesn't help either). Oh and microtransaction is still crap, regardless if you're opening a box in private or a box that appears from the sky for everyone to see.edit: some spellings and making it easier to read.edit2: added some extra details about how the microtransaction is earned/worksedit3:   welp hackers are everywhere.  edit4: Microtransaction  ARE NOT  cosmetic only now.  Details about the microtransaction (as I understand)  Something I believe lots of people are interested in knowing about. I'll put it in bullet points so its easier to read-They're all cosmetics onl-  SIKE NOPE . Contains emblem,  gun , gun skin, emote, icon, etc.- You can earn lootboxes via the game's ""orders"" (functionally speaking, they're pretty much challenges).- What are ""orders""? At the HQ, there's a place (the game will guide you on this) where you can go and choose which orders to activate. They range anything from ""kill 500 enemies"" to ""win a TDM match"". Now, each ""orders"" grants a different reward (e.g XP reward, lootboxes, rare lootboxes, crafting materials), you can see what reward are tied to each ""orders"". They come in daily (24 hours) and weekly (7 days) cycle which will refresh and load new ""orders"". Upon completing a challenge, you have to go manually redeem it (HQ or loadout section).   IF YOU DON'T IT DOESN'T REGISTER AND YOU LOSE YOUR POTENTIAL REWARD WHEN IT REFRESHES NEXT CYCLE   (subject to change imo).- Crafting materials? Yes, like Overwatch, you get crafting materials (armory cred) through various means (e.g dupes from boxes, challenges, hourly/daily ""mail"" which gives you some amount of free crafting materials) which you can use to buy stuff and rank/prestige perks this which lets you buy weapon/class upgrades stuff. You can  technically  buy your way to unlock every weapon, perk and streak specials) via lootbox free exp (each rank gives 1 rank point)- Everyone can see what you get if they're around you, and any  Epic  quality stuff that was unboxed in the HQ (you have to unbox it in the HQ as far as I'm aware of) will be announced on the bottom left as a text (e.g Unforseen Lemonquences has unboxed an Epic item!)- When you open a box, nobody can ""steal"" it (since its considered opened the moment you decide to open one in a sub menu). But they  CAN  troll you by blocking your screen (standing between your character model and lootbox), thus preventing you from taking screenshots to showcase what you got."

												This game's title is a disgrace. When I saw the initial trailer,  I was actually pretty hyped and thought that this might be a good game. Well, it's the worst CoD I've ever played. And it's not even so because the gameplay is bad. It's just that this game pretends it's set in WWII, when it's not.First of all, please save me all ""this is just a game"" talk. If you call a game WWII, and say you'll try to keep it authentic, you do it. Not include stuff that's totally out of place.--> black female soldiers--> fighting for Wehrmacht--> in London--> wearing american helmets, because apparently the devs don't care about creating an even remotely authentic feelingWhy not make ACTUAL WW2 maps??? London?? USS Texas?? Why?? What was the thinking behind this? Were there too few locations to choose from? Jesus Christ, what's next? New York?When I was a kid, I learned a lot about history from games like Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2. Kids playing CoD WWII will spread false knowledge. This is the first CoD since MW3 I spent money on, and definitely the last. This franchise needs to die"

												I really don't undertsand the approach they were going for. You make a game about the second world war, the deadliest conflict on planet Earth till this day, 60 million human beings died in some of the most painful and brutal ways possible. But you're too afraid to include swastikas and the segregation and sexism that existed at the time? I mean, you put WWII in your game's title, but I feel like Return to Castle Wolfenstein is more historicaly accurate.-Zero historical accuracy, which we were promised for at least the campaign.-Delevopers censoring the brutality, sexism, racism, and the symbology of this game.-The voice acting for the Germans in this game sounds like someone typed that trash into google translate and copied the audio wav.s and used them in the game.-The characters in the plot of the campaign are extremely boring and forgetable.-The function of weapons in this game is far from how they truly operate (feels like none of the deveoplers actually fired any of these weapons at a range prior to developing them in game).-The multiplayer makes me want to kill myself, enough said.I usually make parody reviews, and try to make people laugh, but I feel like this really needs attention."

												Terrible!Want to play this coop with my son. Last version that did support cooperative mode was already 6 years old since then no cooperative version been released. With big trumpets and whistles coop mode was announced for CoD WWII. Only to find it doesn't exist. There's no coop mode in WWII. Waste of money. Really sucks they tell you there's cooperative mode again back in the game to find out it's just PR to sell you products you don't want.Also a side note: but the menu is the most anti-intuitive I've ever seen. I mean I program c++ myself and written many software. I'd never make it so complicated to switch between the different options a software package offers you.Between every menu change, 60-180 second long videos are displayed. In previous version you could hit ""ESC"" now you are forced to bake a cake before you got through the whole menu.Worst piece of software I've ever seen in my life! And believe me, I saw thousands of them since the early nineties where I had an old chess game on my commodore."

												Holo sights and guided bombs. Some ""realism"". Might as well be playing Black Ops, only with some WW2 weapons. Thats about the only difference.

												Okay so first things first, I would have to rate the campaign a strong 4/10. WARNING, I finished the campaign in 4 hours. I played the original call of duty's when they released, I loved the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them. This game right here gave me that vibe again but it wasnt nearly as satisfying. The beginning was kind of lame because it was quiet. The original games were so suspensful because you had mortar fire left and right, The D-day mission in this game also had the artillary fire but it sounded so distant and quiet and not in your face. I hated the parts with vehicles, they were just tragic and CoD should just stay completely away from vehicle mechanics, dont even get me started with that damn plane...  The dialogue was awkward all game so I couldn't really get attached to the characters. Lastly, I didn't like how inaccurate some of the weapons represented. The reload animations were downright lasy, and the guns sounded nothing like they should have. Although I did enjoy the winter mission (the only reason for a 4/10), because it was almost the exact setup as in the original game, I was about in tears that mission. Nice try CoD but can you just remaster the first 3 games, no new game mechanics, just updated graphics... please."

  Only 9 non-War maps and they all suck more or less.   Sticky spawns which cause every mode to revolve around trying to spawn kill the other team.  Garbage hit detection. This game has 60hz servers but still plays worse than P2P cods.  Aggressively compressed skill gap (rare spawn flips, garbage scorestreaks, sprinting is heavily punished, extremely slow health regen, random recoil, laughably easy quickscoping, no class customization)  Twitter anticheat.  SHG constantly forgetting to turn on events for PC, and updates are delayed.  Loot boxes are already giving tons of duplicates yet they still keep diluting the loot pool with trash like emblems, old emotes with different flavor text and calling cards with gold borders.

												well i dont realy know why i even got my hopes up for this ""boots to the ground"" experience wich was supposed to be more realistic than previous entries...so what greets me when i enter the campaign you might ask? well the germans are wearing waffen ss eagles on the side of their caps WITH regular army insignia on the front (no waffen ss units were present on the DDAY landings) , they are using PPSH wich was a russian smg, the rate of fire on the mg42 is laughably low, almost the entire german uniform types are just plain wrong! so i exited singleplayer and entered multiplayer, the whole ♥♥♥♥ing thing is filled to the brim with quickscoping kids just ruining the whole ww2 experience! the chats are filled with trashtalking...and the developers that had the audacity to call this realistic also added BLACK WOMEN AND MEN in the german army! yes black people from the freies arabien legion were present in the war, BUT not in the regular army! they have butchered ww2 in this entry no respect AT ALL has been shown! this is no more than a bad reskin of blackops 3 minus jetpacks...if you want real ww2 go with RED ORCHESTRA 2 or day of infamy with some skin mods... DO NOT BUY THIS! and to the developers i can say this...when you decide to make a game about historical events you also have a responsibility to make history justice! no adding! no removing! no censoring! no altering! history is sacred! this game is nothing but a blatant middlefinger to ww2 and those that fought in it, this game is nothing but a cavalcade of pampering to a spoiled safespace addicted group of people that ♥♥♥♥♥ their pants when they see the sig runes or a swastika...this game could have been good...but it fell flat...this game helps to pollute history even more..an example for you here, a friend said excitedly that there was black women in ww2 fighting for the germans...i said NO there was not! he said that he saw it in cod ww2...and he asked why would a game about ww2 a historical event include german black women if there in truth realy was none?! i said that is a realy good question...the only answer i could give was they do it to be ""inclusive"" on the expense of history...you are helping with smearing out what happened with liberal fantasy, alot of todays youth take alot of their knowledge from the screen, no books no docus just games and films...i am a ww2 afficionado and i also collect german ww2 militaria, this pile of anti history just sickens me to the core!"

												Typical COD game - got carried away by the hype otherwise would have avoided.  Every mission so scripted you have to exactly hit the format otherwise you lose by dying or out of time.  Zero fun, just a grind to try and figure out what pathing/actions needed to be taken to get to next checkpoint.  No initiaitve, no ""two ways"" to beat a mission, just ""move here, shoot this, etc"".

												My review is only concerned with the multiplayer portion of the game.So much to complain about this iteration of CoD:1) Cheating. Game appears to have no anti-cheat, even though it says it's VAC protected. People that have been aimbotting blatantly since release are still playing and cheating. The developer put some kind of crappy in-game ban that the cheaters managed to EVADE. For whatever reason, the developer refuses to game-ban these people through Steam. If they did this, then cheaters would not be able to evade the ban by any means other than to buy another copy on a separate account. Cheaters can currently just use Steam Family Sharing to share the game for free with infinite new accounts and get around any in-game bans that the developer created. The game is absolutely flooded with cheaters, and the developer is relying on people reporting cheaters to a twitter account with video footage, instead of using any anti-cheat whatsoever.2) PC port shafted. The developer does not care about the PC port of this game. PC players have missed out on several rewards that the console players received, that were bugged on PC. Their current answer is ""We have no solution for this"". Literally. Contracts were also bugged on PC for months, giving less rewards than on console. They refuse to make it right. PC players have been dealing with a lot of bugs as well, from taking 2 minutes to spawn, to grenades and other bombs causing a permanent drop in frames to <30fps (even on high end rigs), to inputs repeating uncontrollably (such as strafing left, letting go, and it continues to strafe left), to the in-game announcer in War randomly deciding to be 10x as loud as normal and blowing out your ears. The bugs go on, and on, and on.The PC version of the game follows the console version in terms of balancing. What this means, is we are getting a game balanced for people who use a controller to play, when the vast majority of PC users play on mouse and keyboard. I'll let you use your imagination to why this is awful both in theory and in practice for this type of game. ""Pro"" console players and youtube personalities appear to have a lot of sway with the lead developer.3) Bad design choices. NO HEADSHOT MULTIPLIER for anything but sniper rifles. What this means is, if it takes 3 shots to the body to kill someone, it will take 3 shots to the head to do the same. Assault rifles get an attachment that make headshots do extra damage, but the extra damage is very minimal. This is unbelievably bad design. You are not rewarded at all for being able to out-aim your opponent. The time to kill in the normal game modes is very high, in part due to this. To make things more annoying, to unlock most of the camouflages for weapons, you need headshot kills with that weapon. But since there's no headshot multiplier, you're basically hoping the last bullet of your burst or spray will hit their head and grant you a headshot.CoD games in the past typically let you make a very custom load out to truly suit it to your play style. Not so in CoD: WWII. A lot of the perks are tied to a division, and usually the first perk of the division is the most worthless, so it's like a wasted slot. On top of your division choice, you get 1 standalone perk that you can select, and then 2 primary weapon attachments to choose. The game is severely lacking in customizability and diversity. I can't tell if they were just trying to dumb it down, or if they decided they know better than you and want you to only play in specific ways.Everything about this game just seems poorly thought out.The HQ is mostly pointless.There's ""pistol grips"" that fill the loot boxes. There are so many. You cannot even see them on the pistol. It makes no sense. Once you get around 25% of the items, the amount of dupes you get from loot boxes is obscene. Dupes give you 5% in coinage what it costs to buy them from the quartermaster.The ""play of the game"" doesn't allow explosives, and often will choose a random 2 kill over someone who got 5 kills in rapid succession. You can't go into the menu while the play of the game is playing.The time it takes to go from match to match is ridiculously long. From unskippable play of the game, to unskippable post-game scoreboard, to unskippable post-game celebration with emotes... You spend way too much time not actually playing the game in CoD: WWII. This is one that really bothers me. If they would just allow you to exit out of the match once the play of the game starts, I would be satisfied. But no, you must endure a ton of unskippable garbage before you are allowed to play again.There's much more to complain about, but this was already long winded.This developer does not care about the PC port, and they have proven this through their actions repeatedly. I won't be buying another game by them, ever again."

												Same old stuff, terrible story that siezes control off you all the time, hell you can hardly walk 10 feet down the beach without getting control snatched away from you.  Then we have all the historical innacuracies such as PPSh being pretty much on every soldier on the western front :)  The bugs are so bad I threw a smoke grenade and the entire scenery vanished, I had to restart the campaign again to fix it.  Lots of bad animations, frozen soldiers etc.  The gun play is hilarious at times but worst of all was me carrying a little girl with her teddy bear through a warzone and never even took a bullet, utter garbage.Multiplayer is the usual small map with spawning all over the place where everyone dies constantly and then respawns, it's literally the basics of multiplayer gaming, it's horrible.Zombies is the only good thing about this game, kill it now Activision, it's over."

												I... I don't know where to begin.  I wanted this game to be good, really I did.  I have played the Call of Duty franchise from its beginning to its terrible, terrible demise during the Black Flops series.  Campaign-No, you cannot skip the cutscenes.  You WILL have feels for these characters, you WILL (but probably not because they're all lacking depth).*-All those awesome moments in the trailers?  That's all of them.  In the whole game, right there.-The missions?  I expected more.  D-Day, sweet!  Oh, it's over... okay, I guess I was done anyway.  Kinda missing COD2 here though...  A car chase, okay... pretty sure you've done this before, COD, but this works.  Sneaking around a German compound, sweet!  Finally something... oh he saw me?  Wearing this German uniform, he saw me and is apparently upset about this.  Meanwhile all of his buddies are having conversations without actually moving their mouths or talking, that's cool Activision, I'll go elsewhere to fulfill my attention to detail.  A flying mission, sweet.  DEFINITELY did this one in one of the earlier Call of Duty games, but hey, we're repeating everything, so why skip this one.-Physics.  Did we forget this was a thing?  I just watched a Stuka divebomb a tank and pull a 270 up in a matter of maybe 10 meters.  I can hop for days, and hop I will, because...MULTIPLAYER-If you're not hoping or dancing or dolphin diving, you're dead.  Forget what I said, you're already dead, but you respawned so, no, wait, you're dead again.  Because the guns that you have are outmatched by his custom-pro-mod-why-the-hell-is-this-even-in-this-game-gun.-Okay, I'm a huge fan of games that people die when you shoot them, maybe I'll give Hardcore a try...  M1Garand shot, center mass, no kill, he returns fire with a pistol, instant kill at 20 meters.-Kill cam.  Watch it, watch the muzzle of the weapons jump, but the bullets go straight.

There's some new zeds, bombs and fire and stuff.  1 map, hope you like it. -Honestly thought it was good my first run through.  Prologue was cool, read reviews about it being more linear and adventure-y, but once you've opened all the gates, it's a circle map with the old tried and true tactics every game.  Not my flavor, but a solid improvement still.Here's to getting TBagged by that black female German with an American helmet using a Russian PPSH in Gibraltar.*Edit:  You can, apparently, skip the cutscenes.  Lesson to be learned - do not remap your keys, no matter how bad you want them to make sense.  You'll miss things like skipping cutscenes and not getting stabbed repeatedly by that one German nobody wanted to shoot.**Edit2:  MORE INFO ON ZOMBIESTLDR:  Game looks great, plays like a Burger King toy, feels like a hot-and-steamy on a history book, has zombies."

												So, I was previously writing a review with a very positive rating. After reviewing my own review and also purchasing a copy of this game for the playstation 4 (please note my steam copy was a gift and I already fullfilled my ps4 preorder long before this) I will be rating this game negatively. I implore you read my full review as some of the issues that lead me to the negative rating may very well be opinionated. This is also mostly a review of the game itself, I will discuss PC specific topics towards the bottom. May Contain Campaign Spoilers.CampaignPros*Very well crafted, lots of nice scripted events that make the world feel alive.*Removes the overdone health regen system for a more dynamic squad system.*Has some very nice memorable moments making this a very enjoyable campaign.*Has segments of some of the greatest battles of WW2 with near photorealistic graphics.*Heroic events can be pretty intense in higher difficulty levels. *Engine overhaul allowed for mild level destruction which can be awesome during certain missions such as the tank one.Cons*Very cliche, overdone story. The tension between your squad mates is very predicable and you don't ever get enough screen time with any one member to actually form an emotional attachment to.*Relatively short, looking through my achievements I did it in about 6 hours and I didn't really rush it.*There are only 2 sections in which you aren't doing generic soldier combat, would have been nice to get another tank or plane mission.*I had a hard time getting immersed into the world when there was a major lack of attention to detail, an example being swastikas feeling insanely forced as if they were never planned to be in the game before the backlash. *After your squad medic is captured you no longer have access to a substantial amount of health packs, this can make the game insanely tedious while playing at higher difficulty levels. *Only real reason to complete the campaign is a simple helmet you receive in multiplayer.MultiplayerPros*Familiar Call of Duty gunplay, if you enjoy this like I do you will feel right at home. *Nice maps, while this is subjective, I found the maps themselves were fun to play, in certain situations (more info in the cons)*The inclusion of MWRs quartermaster system.*Supply drops are currently not able to be purchasable with real world money, and are obtained through game time and numerous challenges which ensure you get plenty of them sometimes (More info in the cons)*Some of the most iconic guns of ww2*War is a very underrated and unpopulated game mode.Cons*The headquarters, the headquarters is akin to the tower in destiny. In this game it absolutely does not fit. Many features that would fit just fine in its own menu are only accessible through the HQ. Meaning if I wanted to something simple like changing my emblem I would need to load up the whole entire HQ, run across the place, and access yet another menu. As of the writing of this review the HQ also consistently fails to load you into a lobby with other places making it just this empty area with nothing of interest to do. It just seems like an afterthought and only exist to sell people on supply drops.*Gun Balance is very poor and the gun roster contains few unique weapons. All but one sniper rifle are bolt action that kill from the chest up, 3 smgs that are high fire rate short range weapons, and 3 smgs are slow firing ones meant for medium range. Most of the ARs besides the M1 and SGT contain too few bullets and have damage profiles to similar to these two to actually be of use. There are only 4 shotguns, a decent pump action, a weak double barrel shotgun another weak double barrel, and a weak semi automatic. Most of the LMGs fire to slow, contain way too few bullets, and slow your player down so much it would be stupid to not just use an AR. Only 3 pistols, 2 of which have the same damage profile and the other being a machine pistol with insane recoil and 10 bullets. *Supply drops make a return in this game. As of the writing of the review this game does NOT contain any supply drops with weapons that alter gameplay. However, there are several bugs with them. Supply drops are constantly disappearing. (I have earned 7 and only been able to open 2) The developers took a step back and removed the “recently obtained” menu making it hard to find what you actually own. Sadly, unlike MWR the game does not contain any camos in supply drops. Pistol grips are what has replaced MWR camos for the bulk items in supply drops, they are very uninteresting and can only be used on 2 weapons. Like in MWR, once you collect a full “set” of quartermaster items, you earn a special item, usually a reskin of a weapon. However, it is obvious some of them were overlooked and special attention was paid to others. Some of the SMGs have full weapon overhauls and look fantastic while others look almost the exact same with their stock modified, which you don't even see in game. *Spawns are god awful. I have always been a lucky person and never had issues with spawns in previous call of duty titles, so if you thought those were bad you are in for a bad time here. You will constantly spawn within earshot of another player even on some of the larger maps. In smaller maps it is possible for an enemy to spawn directly beside you. *While the maps themselves are good when played properly, good luck finding a game where people play properly. With call of dutys return to boots on the ground combat, comes the flood of players who will prone in odd doorways, sit in the back of the map not contributing to the team, and flank you from BEHIND YOUR OWN SPAWN. Power positions on most maps have to many entrances to make them worth defending and add in poor spawn systems it can make for an unpleasant experience for the majority of your time. *The way penetration damage is handled is very different in this game. I do not have the 100% direct from the code numbers, but I have had situations where the M1 Garand (a 2 shot kill weapon) took 6 shots to kill through a thin sheet of metal. *Flinch is back and worse than ever, nothing is more infuriating than either getting your gun kicked up so high you miss every bullet, or causing another player to flinch giving them a free accidental headshot. *Map count is the smallest a cod game has shipped with. The base game contains 9 basic multiplayer maps and 3 unique maps for the war game mode. This brings the total map count up to 9 maps, but seeing how 3 of them are only accessible in a single game mode with little replayability it is mildly disheartening. *Despite cods recent addition of more 60hz dedicated servers, the way the game is coded to handle latency means you will still be dying around corners that you were fully behind on your own screen. *Some real attention to detail would be nice, clan tags on your weapon that look like they are written in comic sans is a prime example.*If you can think of a bug that's been in every call of duty release up until now, your gonna be in familiar territory. Launch servers still suck, certain challenges are bugged, the new item indicator is still bugged, certain maps fail to load on PC sometimes and so on.Due to steam character limits my zombies and PC related sections was removed, you can view them here https://pastebin.com/R0fsF5Cr"

WARNING- I mean -CARIFICATION!A lot of people are commenting on my short playtime for this game. Some are claiming that its impossible to evaluate all the game's elements in just under two hours- which is true. I did not play every single multiplayer game mode and map or every single campaign mission. I only played some. However, its certainly possible to get a feel for a game by trying out a few things and not all. That's what demos do. And especially in games like CoD, if two or three multiplayer game types and maps are bad, the rest will probably be uneventful and boring as well. And if not, well, its certainly not worth paying $60 for that one game mode and/or map that's fun to play, is it?Onward to the Review!I played the first campaign mission, ""D-Day"", which was pretty cool in and of itself. It set the tone very well. As someone who loves history, it was a very somber experience launching off the boats and onto the beaches of Normandy. Granted, the campaign is not exactly historically accurate, but the opening still serves as a somber reminder of the hell on earth that was World War II. At least it did for me (I appreciate history). But then I played mutliplayer... The game claims to have returned to the CoD roots. I can honestly tell you objectively, from an unbiased perspective, this is false. Of course, there's no space jumping and wall running, but it truly feels like Black Ops 3 with a World War 2 skin; which I suppose is fine for many people who liked Black Ops 3. I liked it, but I don't like a World War 2 version of it. I suppose I may have been expecting something drastically different, since I remember World At War being dramatically different than the CoDs that came after it. But either way, I did not enjoy the multiplayer experience. Allow me to explain: Multiplayer 1) The map design was fairly bad. I mean, the maps were dang beautiful to the eyes, but hideous and disgusting to the gameplay experience. Plus, there's only 8 maps.2) There's a new social space which is kind of... not really necessary, I guess? There's not really a point of it. Just some place you can hang out with people and... watch them gamble their real world currencies for a chance at winning a chance to obtain good-for-nothing and worthless items.3) The customization is rather poor, which is something I've heard many people say so far. Many complained about this in the beta, but it seems they didn't really listen to the feedback in this regard.4) As mentioned above, there's loot boxes in this game. That should be no surprise; as soon as Activision heard about this cancerous money-making scheme, they immediately jumped on board. I hate microtransactions in the loot box form, as does the majority of the gaming community. Gambling real world, hard-earned money for a chance at winning some worthless cosmetic or game-unbalancing weapons and cheats is disgusting and, quite frankly, immature for a studio of this stature. Loot boxes in free-to-play game models make sense. Loot boxes in a $60, supposedly fully finished retail game is absolutely unacceptable and ruins the already unbalanced gameplay of modern Call of Duty games even further. Zombies Now there's the Zombies mode, which was actually very well done. I applaud the designers behind this iteration of Zombies. Its not perfect, but its very exciting and brings back that stressful experience we all came to know and love in World At War and the original Black Ops. As much as I loved it, its certainly not worth buying the game for. I could never justify purchasing a $60 video game solely for the horde mode it offers. If the Campaign was much longer and there were more than two Zombies maps at launch, I    might    consider it. I'm not really going to talk much about Zombies, because its essentially the same model as its always been, but darker and with more grit. I will go over a few things, though.1) The Zombies are more animated, and less...undead, if you can believe that. When I say animated, that's not necessarily a bad thing. I'm not talking about a cartoonish appearance. They're far from that. But they seem like more than just mindless undead humans. They're more, ""lively"", if you will. Which is... not really a zombie. They also speak. Not English of course, but German. Which is also quite strange. But its not like these things are too much in your face. For most people, including myself, it doesn't break the experience. 2) This is still very much Zombies. Its just not ""Nazi Zombies"" from World At War, which is what many of us wanted this to be. There's still perks, easter eggs, etc. Really nothing has changed gameplay-wise. Many of the perks are generally the same but with new icons and names. Some are new, though. I'll leave those for you to discover yourself if you decide to purchase this anyway. But please, save your money. Campaign  Normally the Campaign is the first thing I do in any first person shooter. I play games not for the multiplayer experience (although I most certainly do get my money's worth on the multiplayer modes), but I mainly purchase games for the single player stories they offer. This game certainly does well in it's singleplayer mode. The campaign is (generally for the most part) nearly an accurate representation of how dark and horrible the worst conflict in human history actually was. In fact, it surpasses Battlefield 1 largely when it comes to the ""War Is Hell"" mood that both games tried to set. Battlefield 1, which I enjoy far more than this game, did a horrible job at realizing the realities and tragedies of war, making its stories about being a fantastical War Hero performing stunts that were sometimes even near superhuman, whereas this game does it very well, for the most part. Its no Private Ryan, but it comes close. Summary Call of Duty: World War II is a fair attempt to recreate the World War II experience for Call of Duty, however, it fails to shake off the dust of the previous Sci-fi games, which had lead to the series' downfall. Its still extremely reminiscent of the latest games like Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare, and fails to return to the roots as it claims. Its almost as if this game's multiplayer experience is Black Ops 3 with boosting disabled and a WW2 appearance, with nothing else changed.While the Campaign and Zombies modes are certainly very interesting and would be entertaining to play for hours on end, they too fall short of being worthy of the $60 price tag. The Campaign is fun and interesting, but very, very short. The Zombies mode is great, but its not worth buying the game just for Zombies right now.If you loved Black Ops 3 or Infinite Warfare, you'll probably love this, but if you're thinking this game returns to its roots and is reminiscent of World At War or the first three CoD games, think again. This most certainly does not return to the roots of the franchise despite the claims, and thus, I do not recommend this game. Do not spend your hard-earned money on this quite yet. Have patience and wait for either a sale, or wait until there's more content. Unforunately, though, the latter will be very irritating, since you'll have to purchase the Season Pass to get the later content, which furthers my point as to why this game is not worth it."

												“CoD WW2 is the game that promises to go back to the roots of CoD and is going to redefine WW2 for a new gaming generation”Let me start with some basic background to give this negative recommendation some context.- Have been playing the CoD franchise since day one - longer if you count the original MoH.- Imo the early CoDs up to BO were the best, with BO2 being the best of the new gen.- Starting with BO2 I have more or less ignored SP alltogether.- I don’t hate the MP in the newer future warfare games like AW, IW and BO3.- CoD MP still fills a place, but has long been surpassed by the Battlefield franchise in depth and quality.- I try to limit myself to Hardcore objective oriented games over regular TDMThere are some positive notes. Performance on my rig is fine (4790k / GTX 1080 / 16gb).If for an instance I forget that opening line, I’d say that CoD WW2 MP is on par with the late generation CoDs, with fast action on stamp sized maps, good for a quick and aggressive match. Technically it is not better or worse, ignoring the post release bug or two - which in MP I personally have not experienced.In case you like late generation CoD MP, you’ll probably like WW2 as well. The theme is more or less cosmetic as weapons fall within the same categories and effectiveness. The MP does rely less on perks than before, that is probably the biggest difference.Unfortunately by choosing WW2, by marketing the way they did Activision made a mistake. By referring to those classic CoD games of yesteryear they created an expectation which the game does not live up to, not only that, but they certainly redefined WW2 for the new gaming generation. Enough has been written about that, but the need to be all inclusive has pushed WW2 mp beyond recognition, destroying any chance of suspension of disbelieve.The weapons in the game make no sense, some of the maps don’t make sense, the reward uniforms often make no sense and the ability to wear a US helmet as a German makes no sense. The latter is a real issue in quick identification and this design choice shows the new CoD to be a factory product, published and produced by people who do not care and made by people who do not care nor understand. Sadly judging by the younger generation of gamers, they don’t understand either...Last, but not least, Activision at its height of corporate greed, has put the map that defined the classic WW2 experience - Carentan - behind a dlc. That alone deserves a negative recommendation.Played some SP to allow me to write this reviewThe visuals are good, but the gameplay is pretty bad - especially the quick time events.(See update)MP without context - 7/10 just standard late CoD formula ex performance perksIn WW2 context and including the Carentan decision - 4/10Maybe Zombies should up that score, but unfortunately that’s not a gamemode I play much.If they include Zombies split screen I’ll change my recommendation.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1199266283UPDATE: The SP isn’t that bad, when it is not trying hard to be something else than CoD it can even be pretty good. Visuals and performance are good running smoothly at 4k with a steady 60fps! The first mission is heavy on quick time, but luckily there are few after that. Clichés, revisionism, odd german weapon mix and crappy tank controls aside there are some classic CoD moments to enjoy, if only there were more of them - 7.5/10EDIT: MP - someone made a beautiful remark on the WW2 forum that after sinking in made perfect sense, but I’ll rephrase it as seen from my point of view.***WW2 CoD MP is cosplay nerfwar for millennials.***The term SJW misses the mark, as it is about a new generation of gamers that likes to dress up and have fun. They don’t care about history or authenticity, let alone understand the revisionism and shallow gameplay.So lets introduce the steam punk and gingerbread skins!"

												As it is and always has been, Call of Duty World War II is broken up between the singleplayer and multiplayer/zombies component.Singleplayer:First Call of Duty game during WW2 for almost a decade and it does its best to keep things original. There's no regenerating health though there is still lots of scripted sequences and similar objectives to the kind of WW2 FPS games most of us have played already.Nothing amazing and not worth buying for, but decent enough.Multiplayer:A complete ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥torm. Multiplayer at the moment (25/11/2017) is plagued with hackers, horrible lag compensation that is horrible even by COD's standards and maps that facilitate camping. People either seem to use Sniper Rifles, which are usually a 1 hit kill or SMG's which due to the lag compensation and packet loss you're often literally melted in an instant, often before you've seen who's shooting at you.There's very few maps in the rotation and only a few of them are genuinely any good. The inclusion of war mode is an objective based game mode but it just causes the opposing team to spam grenades on a capture point whilst the attackers hurl themselves onto the objective like lambs to the slaughter.Loot crates aren't pay to win, but are cosmetic and most of the challenges ingame reward you with crates instead of XP or unlockables. Otherwise this is your standard COD multiplayer mode and will probably die in time like the others have.Zombies:Obtuse, confusing objectives sprawled across a large map as you and a bunch of other players try to complete them before the zombies become too artificially difficult to defeat. It's got a lot of character and seeing David Tennant in a video game is fantastic, but without actual friends to play with, this gets boring very quickly.Like the singleplayer, not worth buying the entire game solely for."

												Wow, what can I say about this game?The game constantly crashes after every round, the devs left out split screen for the second year running and the hit detection is horrible compared to BO3 and Infinity.  At least the public servers are accessable and the graphics are nice, so there is that.But seriously, how is it that we are not able to sit on the couch with a few friends and enjoy CoD like days of old?They devs wanted to go back to the franchise's roots....really?  Then why are we forced to play online against professional players and teenagers with no way of being able to play with people who stand in the same room?And microtransactions?  What is wrong with you people?  If you all are going to go that route then you should charge 20€ for the original game, instead of milking top dollar from hard working people! It also doesn't sit well that BO3 is completely broken since Update 24 two moths ago.  Since that was the last good CoD zombie title one can imagin my anger on that point. I really don't know what to make of this new business model that Activision has got going on, but I for one am tired of this.  If this game doesn't improve it will be my last CoD.

												Note: this review gets a lot of hate, primarily fueled by killstreak-loving adhd children who probably think this is as close to what a great game the original CoD's were it can get, as all they know are MW, BO and whatever they♥♥♥♥♥♥out beyond that. All they know is killstreaks, small (horribly designed) maps, spawnraping, quickscoping on horrible servers with very limited players. You can think that's fun, and I get that. However, my opinion stands. I even went back and played CoD1 multiplayer and even though there's a few servers populated at a time, those servers have 25+ people (or more obviously but nothing like it once was unforunately :() on them and the it's hands down a better world war 2 experience, despite the graphics.If this was supposed to make me think back to Call of Duty 1/UO/2 and get my squad back together.. then I'll be the first to say it does the opposite. And that's from someone who put 2000+ hours into cod1 & 2 back then if I remember my xfire profile correctly, and played competetively on clanbase. I'm naming a lot of things here that don't exist anymore, and the ""old call of duty feel"" can fit right into that list.The singleplayer: I quit at the part during the landing where they turn the game into a quicktime event onrail shooter. That is just lazy and boring as hell. Whoever thinks that is good gameplay and manages to push through that crap that shouldn't even be in a fps game is well out of his mind. Not to mention I also had an issue with the landing itself.. it's so linear that the game simply janks you to where you're supposed to be. I ran left upon landing, wanting to fire upon the bunkers for a bit and take in the scenery before moving to the objective, like 20 seconds tops, (cos it does look good) however the game just janked me straight to the right (20+ metres) put me on my back with a dude talking in my face all in the time of one second.Jumping into my first multiplayer game I found virtually nothing that reminded me of the good ol' days. The maps here (given I only played 3 since I couldn't be arsed going over the 2h refund cap) feel very small and overall the game just doesn't feel right. I mean sure.. the shots sound okay, the guns look okay and the recoil is there.. however.. I can't put my finger on it.. it lacks something.. It feels a bit consoly (due to lack of a better word).Next thing I know I had a bunch of killstreaks and was dropping bombs on the enemy team. That's where all connection with the old CoD's just vanished for me, and with that the game vanished from my collection. I like to work for my kills, not drop a bomb on the spawnpoint. Also: leaning. In the old cod's one could lean. Now I have to show my entire body like I'm some scrub. EDIT: Found that they added it in the full game but you have to bind the keys cos the game assumes everyone is going to use a gamepad.  (it wasn't in the beta) EDIT: Refunded on Steam and bought it for €45 off-steam to ♥♥♥♥ around every now and then and see if they improve anything. I'll update this review if they do so."

												Decent game, has all the cliches you would expect from a WWII game.  Enemies are bullet sponges, take multple headshots to kill but pose no real threat to you because you have basically an infinite amount of health packs and ammo.  Graphics are decent but there are frequent bugs and performance issues.  Also the game has a surprising amount of historical inaccuracies which is a shame, given CODs lineage the devs really should have put more effort into getting that kind of stuff right.  Game feels like it could have used another few weeks being playtested. Even with all of that I would have given it a reccomendation if not for the ""tank level"".  About half way through the game you play as a tank driver clearing a path through a city.  The controls for the tank are some of the worst I have ever used.  It seems that WASD move the tank in random directions, the mouse sensitivity in the tank is so low that you can't aim the turret and there seems to be a random drift applied to your crosshairs which causes you to miss shots even when your tank is not moving.All in all this game goes through the same motions as older WW2 fps like Medal of Honor and the original Call of Duty's but it just doesn't feel right.  It fails to capture the same scale and evoke the same emotions."

												This is the first time I have left a review but I had to as this game is sooooo bad. I have loved the old Call of Duty WWII game  and played it to death. After 1 day of this rubbish I give up.  Even though the Graphics are amazing and you can see the time that went into them, thats about all. No thought went into game play.Sinlge Player is Laughable, it is so linear it is untrue. you follow a set path until you make it. Thats it done and dusted. Multiplayer. maps are so small max number of players is 12. Then you pay £39.99 for a ""season pass"" which basically is 1 map. way to go on fleecing people. Here is a run down of how multiplayer works.  3 2 1 begin....run to the enemy, bunny hop, shoot enemy...enemy respawns and bunny hops and shoots you, rinse and repeat.....the game is poor from start to finish."

												Absolutely Shameful.  The Historical Inaccuracies and censorship are so prevelant that it makes me sick.  They did a good job on the base game mechanics with the AI and cutscenes but thats where it stops.  They even managed to ruin and defame one of the most iconic battles in history. you breach the beaches of normandy in barely over a minute(and by breaching i mean you run straight to the wire and quickly blow it with a bangalore which is set of by a clacker lol and you are less than 15 feet from it with absolutley no cover).  there is very little historical scenery and you got Germans running out of bunkers with ppsh41s, a Russian SMG that was NEVER used by the Germans at any point, especially D-Day.  Censorship of historical material such as the SS uniforms....arm bands were wiped of the Nazi Party emblem and replaced by some garbage. and I could go on about that as well.  Multiplayer the weapons has reflex sights.....like wtf I guess the germans had modern tech back in the day as well as shotguns with incendiary rounds and acogs for sniper rifles.  Servers are♥♥♥♥♥♥  They cadered to the typical COD playstyle of quick scoping and other nefarious and annoying practices.  But the Up front, bottom line here is that They advertised a WW2 era game. not a typical COD FPS with the theme of WW2. there is a difference and I feel as if I had a fast one pulled on me.  I left COD after Ghosts becuase the direction they went in wasnt one I was willing to go. If i wanted futuristic Id play Halo or Destiny.  I bought this game becuase I though COD was legitimately going back to its roots not making false claims to get a temporary boost in purchases.  So if you Like traditional COD games where you can quickscope, get cool attachments and power-ups and prestige then man this is your game.  If you want a real WW2 game then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. just wait for the real game devs to save the day with Battlefield 2 or whatever they plan on calling it.  I was once a die hard COD fan turned Battlefield loyalist for life now after this."

												Honestly... this is what they've come out with?I wont go into all the historical inaccuracies that seem to be overwhelmingly on everyone's mind. I do mind those, but my annoyance in playing this goes beyond that. Really, I dont even feel like spending a lot of time on this. It is just a really bad FPS. Single player, I found myself muttering to myself: ""I mosdef need more ammo, I had to kill two guys."" or ""Really.. I shot you in the face.."" while being sniped by any weapon with any level of accuracy from blindfire. Plus, whenever you get into the rhythm of actually fighting the enemy they have to take your weapons and force you into some sort of mini-game of their choosing. There is really no comfortable playing experience to be had. (the less I say about trying to handle the tank the better) It is a pretty game, but pretty poor in every other way that I can judge it."

												Well, this is my first negative review, i'll be very honest with it:The campaign generates null sense of empathy to the protagonist and the story itself, reaching dull moments and trying to forget that with a LOT of cliché moments (excluding the amount of crashes or gamebreaking bugs). In Multiplayer, i cannot recommend a game which has P2P multiplayer setup, it just screws everyone except the host. besides, a little detail: it has season passthe only bastion of this game is Zombies, which has a balanced, fair progression system, but this game ain't worth it just for Zombies. (mode that actually has two maps for everyone, if you wanna continue your zombies storyline, you gotta buy the season pass)(i'd rather not comment in-depth about the typical negative points of the saga because they're too simple -pooping on historical accuracy or archaic recycled mechanics- just to make sure if you don't get it.)if this game doesn't go lower than the actual price (which is almost 80 bucks without season pass), your ""Call of Duty"" is to avoid this game, for now."

This is headshot, headshot, headshot... hacker types.  Most disturbingly, when you view their steam profile, they already have multiple vac bans on record!!!! 3 Dom matches: 4 Different cheaters (yes, they are even grouping up now)2 TDM matches: 2 different cheaters. If you were thinking of fanning the flames of nostalgia of COD of days past, save your money.  If you thought your kid might like this for Christmas, save your money.  It will just end up being a disappointment. This was my first COD in 3 years that I spent my own money on, and it is likely the last unless there is a very clear effective anti cheat system put in place. #RIPCODWWIIPC"

												Any reviewer for a website or magazine who applauds any aspect of this game deserves to be fired immediately. Aside from the obvious and stupid mistakes of having German soldiers carrying and using Russian weaponry, the persistent problem in COD games where a vanilla weapon of a given caliber cannot use ammunition from an identical weapon found on the ground simply because the found weapon has a bayonet attached, and the shallow, poorly made storyline, here are the problems:1) The friendly AI is absolutely useless. Much of the gameplay revolves around rushes and charges. Every enemy soldier will find and target you instantly, but the 5-10 squadmates surrounding you will shoot at trees, rocks, and piles of mud instead of the enemy. Time and time again, I got shot in the butt and turn around to see one German soldier flanked on both sides by AI teammates who just stare at said German, evidently lost in the depths of his blue master race eyes. And this happens over. and over. and over. and over again.2) Every gun that isn't an M1 or K98 is useless. Automatic firearms are either too inaccurate to use at the engagement distances the railroaded gameplay puts you in, or are so weak that it takes half a 30-round magazine just to drop one guy in a wool trench coat. What about headshots, you ask? Nope. Four headshots from a Thompson before your average Nazi bites the dust. Literally the only guns you want to carry are the K98 and M1. Maybe the M1A1 carbine if you're in a pinch or the SV40. But everything else is useless.3) The tank controls are so far beyond sh*t it's embarassing. Spoiler alert: There's a brief bit where you helm a tank. Sounds cool until you're flanked by two Panzers, and for some inexplicable reason you can't turn while rotating the gun turret, and if you push forward or back the genius control system will try to steer your tank in the direction your turret is facing instead of, you know, going forward or backward. It's beyond frustrating, and I damn near punched a hole in some drywall just trying to get past this part of the campaign.4) Dialogue. I have heard more compelling readings of dialogue from semi-literate junior high students. Your character - Red - has all the emotional depth and feeling of day-old oatmeal. The scripted dialogue itself is nearly nonsensical in portions and where it does make sense is so forced it borders on date-r*pe.There is literally nothing redeeming about this game. Maybe, maybe buy it when it goes on sale, but God have mercy on me for being stupid enough to pay sticker price for this steaming turd of software."

												Well, here it is. Call of Duty ""WWII"" in all it's poop polished glory. Like a lot of people who grew up with this game, I was excited to see that Activision was taking a chance and returning to their original game series. I'm not one of those people who constantly hates on these games, but I do understand that these works are primarily pumped out for cheap, and sold enitrely on brandname alone. ****ACHTUNG**** So I didn't have any of the technical issues some people are reporting, a smooth 60FPS the whole time. My gripes are with the material of the game itself. However, as a WWII shooter, this game is laughable. I've seen SS troops on Normandy, which as most will know, were not there. Ever. I've seen PPSH machine guns, everywhere, which of course is a Russian SMG, not German. Most of the firearms in the game sound very soft, not realistic at all. The fire rate of the MG42 is nearly identical to that of the Browning .50, which also has an extremely slow fire rate, something the MG42 did not have. Items such as heavy MGs and Flamethrowers are more like gimmicks than actual weapons of war, they run out of ammunition far too quickly and half the time are given to you, after you've encountered a good group of enemies. Basically, they're wasted. The reloading of the M1 Garand is completely wrong, which I personally find unforgivable. The characters are very bland, not one thought was given to them or their creation. I've put two hours in so far, and I have no idea who even has a name! What is the story? Why am I here? Why do I care about these people? I feel like no heart or soul was put into either one of the main characters, the rest of the team, or the twin girls, one of whom is somehow English and the other being French. Seriously, their character models look identical to me, I can't tell a difference. There is a tank battle level, which is the most laughable thing I've ever played in a video game. It's far too short, and firing the tank feels about as unsatisfying as having sex with a solo cup filled with cottage cheese. It's cold, smells gross and has absolutely no grip. But what is even worse is how bad the feedback is for when you've been hit by an enemy! My health went from super to crap and I didn't even know I was being hit due to there being no decent feedback! Actually, a lot of the games problems, if you ignore the inaccuracies, comes directly from the fact that the levels are far too short, very 2-dimensional and full of easy to miss ""collectables"" because God knows we all care about finding that one German dudes lighter. Amirite? Oh, and yes. There is a level where you have to play Metal Gear Solid. Except, you have to play it in the COD engine and you're not Big Boss. And there is no Quiet. So, it's pretty much♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you will feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥having failed this level for the 12th time on recruit. I died on that level half a dozen times just due to how poorly deisgned it is, my own team mates often running infront of my flamethrower and causing an error loss- and how the game isn't optimized for stealth. Because when I think WWII, I'm thinking about ""stealth."" I mean seriously, I feel like that ""Liberation"" level itself should be the prime example in a game design and development text book, next to the word ""Don't do this."" Who playtested that and thought it was fun? I'm guessing the same person who brought back health packs. (Which kind of is fun, actually. Huh. :/)But the most damning thing of all to me, is the fact that when you get right down to it. This game is inferior in every way when compared to World At War. A GAME ALMOST TEN YEARS OLD. 2017 BRAND NEW GAME 60$ MSRP. Still worse than a 10 year old title. Just save your 60$ and buy WatW when it's on sale. It's lightyears ahead of this game. The potential is here, to be fair, but I'm guessing the focus testing groups made of 12 year old neckbeards and Berkley graduates took a giant dump over any hope the game had. ***UPDATE***So I tried out the multiplayer. It's absolute trash. That's literally all I care to say of it. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."

												Well, was a gift from the wife, and we put in for a refund after 0.8hrs of play.Reason?  Feels like a console port, even remapping the controls you would still get pure console vibes, not akin to what you want/expect on a PC FPS title.My 2c.p.s.

												Same old, same old.  Lots of promises about content and historical accuracy.  Well safe to say none of it was true.  Campaign chapters are all samey type, Starts with a fight up the beach and then plant a bangalore to get through beach head (can't remember for the life of me which game started similar to that before (CoD or Medal of Honor). Had a few glitches with jittery sound and crashed my computer twice.  Multiplayer is not much better, once you have figured it all out which can take a while and control feels a lot like black ops, which i hate.Just my opinion but not impressed to the point where i looked at getting a refund but steam says NO because I have over 2 hours gameplay, no ifs no buts.  Think it takes a  bit more than 2 hours to ensure its rubbish.  Oh well time to suck it up and try and get soome monies worth out of it, Thanks steam, for absolutely not giving a damn about your customers satisfaction, will go to GOG and origin in future, as I know GOG customer care is far superior."

												Well where to start from..again, like every year..I can confess and present myself as quite annual COD gamer. I have played every COD instalment and have much MP experience.Not sure if I was waiting such this years COD instalment with bunch of over hyped wishes and expectations.Much anticipated WWII theme to return in COD franchise, for most people it seemed to be cool as ♥♥♥♥, but in reality wait hell no - it is not as it used to be!Bunch of historical inaccuracy, go watch all the youtubes as it would take all time and paper to write all these in this review.Casual and forgettable SP game. Although good looking campaign with some video improvement as you could suspect.Anyway, the campaign is very similar for every year to follow, with ridiculous action, repetitive and predictable plots.Bunch of unrecognisable second hand actors which cannot be confirmed or confronted to the ones from previous instalments like Kit ""Snow"" Harington or recent sex abuser scandalous star Kevin Spacey.SPOILERS - hackers again! For generations COD developers seems to be handicap to deal with these scums. Well this is not exclusion as well, free unpublishable hacking in every third multiplayer match! With this COD even some ""new"" hacking standards may be reached. The game even crashes for me if I try to make a hacking report, it seems they even encourage such behaviour. Unforgivable!The best part of all this pack is zombie mode. Zombiezzz are really good and it seems all the funding went to this mode only.Overall crappy 5 of 10 Nazi points..Good luck next year to sell againP.S. please do not use Lassie themed soundtracks in COD for the future OMFG"

												Stupid things in this game:- Germans with PPSH-41, SVT-40 on D-DAY??? I have seen more Germans carrying Russian guns than actual German guns.- MG42 sounds terrible: how hard is it to fire a real MG42 on a range in order to get the sound right?- Aimlock on player: your fellow soldiers push onto a field taking heavy enemy fire, but as soon as you step onto that field all guns point towards you. Insanely frustrating.- Stupid AI: Germans seeking cover on your side of the fence, behind hay stacks - do I have to continue?- Start of the cutscene is ALWAYS laggy: looks like the start of cutscenes are locked on 30 FPS, after this the FPS goes back up to 800+. This hurts my ♥♥♥♥ing eyes Sledgehammer.`- Inconsequent: The use of swastika's during cutscene's but ALMOST total censorship during the actual game.- After playing through the game I conclude this could've and should've been so much more. The campaign is a missed chance."

												I've been a Call Of Duty Player since FOREVER basically, I can say I'm a pretty skilled and experienced player. I learn the game just by simply playing and learning the map spawns and learning the players way of thinking. My SPM has been fairly high past couple COD games with a 400-500 SPM. I still managed to keep a high SPM and KD ratio but this COD has been a struggle compared to others. Here are my PROS AND CONS about what I think about the game in general.(CONS) - The game had so much pontiental, but sadly after the first couple weeks of the game release, PC version of COD WW2 had died faster than expected this year. The @SHG developers gave poor attention to the games unbalance, bugs, and glitches that ruins the game day by day. The game is still infected with CHEATERS and it was really impossible to enjoy a game fairly when you have people using cheats. If they add a better anti-cheat, maybe it could fix 1/5 problems the game has. The animations in the game are really bad sometimes with the character movements. Most maps are really buggy, and badly design. Shotguns being buffed recently has taking over the game when everyone is using it because it is so Overpowered. Some weapons in the game are just ridiculous, the hit reg on some weapons in the game are noticeably atrocious. The connections/ servers are just terrible at times. I can keep going on and.......on etc. I'm highly disappointed with @SHG, they can still fix this game (PC verison) if they would of listen to the PC community MORE!!(PROS) - Of course the BOOTS on the ground. I like the HQ feature in this game and the fact that you can earn DLC weapons by completing challenges without even spending ridiculous amount of REAL money to have a 1/1000000 chance to get a DLC weapon/weapon variant from the supply drops. Also, the weapon sounds are amazing, the blood and gore is awesome. The daily challenges contracts is what every COD should have. The only Positive things I can say rightnow about this game. I RATE THIS YEARS COD  6/10"

												After playing this game through the single player ""story"" I have to give them props for even talking about death camps, even though they didn't make this section long or as impactful as it could have been. However the story which makes an attempt to focus on teamwork and relying on your squad mates, this is completely counteracted by the game play. The AI for your squadmates and in fact any of the USA army by your side is a joke. with exception to some scripted moments, the AI can't manage to kill a enemy 5 feet from themselves or from you well you are reloading. I am sure this was meant to make you feel powerful and the ""hero"" as without you the group is doomed. the only thing this manages to achieve is the feeling of your teammates being useless, and that your have do everything.  the same seems to be true of the enemy but the other way around, you are their main target. There were multiple times when the an enemy would shoot at me with an squadmate of mine 2 feet from him. meanwhile the squadmate couldn't hit him at all.Sadly I can’t recommend the game based upon multiple issues with the gameplay and the story. The multiplayer games are small and some of the maps are poorly balanced, leading to you praying to spawn a certain side of the map."

Either the servers are bad or I am matched to a server in a country outside of Australia, so 400+ ping = no fun = no win = no reward.-Timed MP reward system punishes poor players, rewards hackers or pros. Good players and hackers will level up super fast by learners or people who fight vs hackers will lose and be killed, wasting their Orders/Quests and missing out on the rewards. Pay 1200 credits for a 10 min order to get a rare supply crate if you kill 35 enemies in TDM. Then you end up in a TDM game with hackers on 32-1.

												Have not played cod in years and was drawn back with a WW2 version.  I understand i am pretty much fodder not playing games in so long but i remembered these games being fun never the less. Graphics are nice,  have not had much issues with bugs.  Problem is  multi player or the lack of.  Small maps, limited choices and no pvt servers can be found so far so your stuck in games with at most 12 players. At least 20% of these a stat padders or have some sort of cheat ( getting sht through rocks or sniped when the replay does not even show me in the scope or near the crosshairs). I entered the recruit level being new and get teamed against people who are mid to high level officers..  Drop a half a clip int a player only to have him not slow down and kill me in one shot running away. ( kill replay shows my hits were solid and chest and head)   Reminds me why i quit playing years ago.  Not saying there are not good players only saying a number of these players and there game play don't make sense compared to what is suppose to happen.   When you have very limited choices on where you can play, the same people on it and have players pushing 20-30 kills against 0-2 deaths in a 10 min game when most are averaging  a neg k vs d rate or  3-5 kills over deaths there really is not any purpose to continue playing.  Limited maps, map sizes, severs and server size ( will not allow larger clans or groups to play tgether) and questionabe game play = a game that won't last very long because it aleinates a large number of old or long time players who enjoy large or larger multi player gameplay numbers. Wish i could but do not recommend this game and sorry i bought it because i find the multi play option very limited and  predictable  and somewhat boring for the most part lacking any need for stradegy or team play"

												Single Player: 3/10Graphics: 9/10 Multiplayer: 4/10Zombies: 7/10Bugs/Complete game upon release: 5/10Overall: 5.6/10  To start off, I have not purchased or played any of the Call Of Duty games since Modern Warfare 3. I decided to give WWII a chance in the hope that it would be similar to World At War or Modern Warfare 2, which were both excellent games. Single player: Luke warm at best. The story leaves a lot to be desired, and is far behind the quality and depth of previous COD games such as World At War. It is clear that the bulk of development resources went into the multiplayer content of the game. They have German troops defending Normandy with Russian SMGs.... really Activision? I expected both a British and Russian storyline to follow the US missions, and was dissapointed to realize this was not the case. The game claimed to ""return to its roots"" in regards to the franchise.  The original Call Of Duty games had much longer campaigns featuring multiple factions. Compared to all previous Call Of Duty games id put the single player content in WWII at the bottom. 3/10Graphics: Game is pretty, not terribly hard on the V-ram. As long as you have a half decent system and a good 4gb of VRAM things should run smoothly. But dont trust the optimization, configure your own settings. 9/10Multiplayer: Every game mode is just deathmatch with some objectives thrown in. The maps are small and spawnpoints change at a remarkable rate. There are no friendly lines and your are just as likely to die from behind as from in front. All the essential COD multiplayer elements are there but it just seems to be lacking. The exception would the the ""WAR"" gamemode. Looking past the fact that the tanks are indestructible and have no offensive capability besides a machine gun which players can occupy, again... really Activision? Other than that the mode offers a refreshing change to the constant deathmatch modes. Sadly they only made 3 Maps/Missions and it quickly gets old. 4/10Zombies: I have few complaints about the Nazi Zombies Co-op mode. I've always enjoyed playing zombies and they did a good job with this one. The matchmaking system is the worst part. It consistantly groups me with players far below my level. AFK players sitting in lobbies is another irritation, with no way to communicate or kick in lobby it prevents the game from starting.  7/10Bugs/Complete upon release: The game is buggy. Just today I have counted 6 crashes. One of these resulted in some sort of file corruption that forced me to re-validate my files on Steam before the game would work again.  And my system far exceeds the minimum system requirements. There also appear to be incomplete aspects of the game. Things like the emblem designer in multiplayer marked with a ""coming soon"". The game also seems to be inexplicably mission various weapons that should be essential to any WWII shooter. The Mosin Nagant rifle, DPS machine gun, Browning 30.cal, and the Gewehr 43 rifle, just to name a few. 5/10A few additional thoughts:Why only 3 side arms?! No revolvers either...Why can only SMGs be equipped with silencers? Not pistols??? Iron sights should not be an attachment for the rifles. Why cant I use the Enfield or the Springfield with ironsights?!The panzerschreck has an explosive radious of about 1ft.... really activision?"

												I am going to go very in depth with this review, but let me preface it with this-- for those of you who are thinking of buying this game, avoid it at all costs. If you are looking for a modern World War 2 game, consider Red Orchestra, Day of Defeat, or even COD: World at War. Do not buy this. Even better yet, go buy an Xbox or PS2 and play the old Call of Duty games, or the old Medal of Honor games. These games covered all the theatres of the war, had some semblance of historical accuracy, and concentrated on gunplay as opposed to plot.The purpose of this game was to be a ""return to roots"" for the Call of Duty series as a whole. Why? Because their rivals at Electronic Arts had a smashing success developing a WW1 game. But the folks at Activision did not want to take such a big risk, so they decided returning to the setting of WW2 would be appropriate. The result? A game with an aborted plot, with elements grabbed from old Call of Duty games, elements stolen from Medal of Honor, and even older films. Your character, Daniels is given a feeble back story, and the whole campaign is centered around facing the fears resulting from this back story. The trope of conflict between comissioned and non-commissioned officers (a la Platoon) is rehashed several times. The conflict results in a certain sergeant lashing out at his men and drinking (all tropes), and you learning about yet another back story in with the sergeant could not save his men. Then everyone is friends, fine and dandy. The writers of the story claimed that the player would deal with racism and other prejudices, and that the story would hinge upon these interactions. You have a German Jewish best friend (who can speak German), and the fact he can speak German is remarked upon perhaps once. You have an African American engineer (a comissioned officer), and your colleague remarks that ""he is surprised, [the African American] was allowed to fight with us."" That's not a racist statement. That's a statement shunning the policies at the time. Your German Jewish friend proceeds to get kidnapped and sent to a POW camp. The writers try for a shock moment by implying that your colleague was sent to Bergan-Belsen (which was an extermination camp, not a POW/work camp), and you walk through the camp and find your friend in a weak, useless epilogue. Apparently, finding your friend in the woods behind the camp somehow results in you getting over your childhood fears. I don't know what idiotic writers were hired for this game, but they clearly overstated what this game was going to be. They advertised racist conflict, espionage, a human story, a campaign centered around liberating concentration camps and experiencing the horrors of war. These qualities were rendered in the most watered-down, and immature fashion imaginable. To reduce the experiences of POWs and veterans in this sort of manner is dishonorable to say the least.Let me also talk about how this whole game was ""inspired by"", and paid ""homage"" to other games and movies (i.e. tactit plagiarism). There was a lot of content copied from Battlefield 1-- bringing down an armored train, playing as a female character, sneaking around with supressed weapons in a semi-open world setting, the emphasis on bolt guns. The espionage sequence was straight from Wolfenstein. The D-Day sequence, the ""heroics"" minigames are lifted almost exactly from the Medal of Honor series. Add to that an annoying amount of quick time events taken from COD 3. The bridge detonation sequence and Stuka fight were lifted from the first Call of Duty. The thermite verse Panzer tank sequence was lifted from Wolfenstein and Medal of Honor (they used RDX in MOH instead). Even the cover of the game pays homage to the famous ""thousand yard stare"" photo which is supposed to illustrate the idea of battle fatigue/combat stress reaction/PTSD. Are you kidding me? This game does barely anything to convey the so-called horrors of war (or does so in such an abortive, watered-down fashion), how can it even justify paying homage to such a historically important image? There was not a single innovative or otherwise original aspect to this game. Almost all the elements (including most of the good ones) were lifted from other sources and shoehorned into this abomination of a game.Let's get on to the gunplay/gameplay. It sucked. The weapons did not feel right. The rate of fire on almost all the weapons was slowed down considerably compared to the historical counterparts. The writers claimed that there would be some semblance of historical accuracy, but there wasn't. The Germans were using Russian weapons on the Western front, when in reality they were used exclusively in the Eastern front, where things were getting desperate. You could sprint with an MG42. The hitboxes made it so a headshot took 3-4 shots to kill barring aside battle rifles (on the hardest difficulty setting). There was an overuse of anti tank weapons being used against infantry. The focus was on the Western Front, but what of the other fronts? Africa/Middle East? Pacific? China/India/Burma? THIS WAS A WORLD WAR, THE WHOLE WORLD WAS INVOLVED. And what do the writers do? Focus on the most rehashed, most known part of the war. The most gaping issue? Where the hell are the Nazi swastikas? Or right. They were removed to not offend the delicate sensibilities of someone trying to play a rated-M game about WW2. The writers promised us something different, but instead what we got is a quasi-plagriasied, empty piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥  The game ran fine on Class 1 hardware, despite some lag spikes here and there. This is the only positive aspect of this game. The download of the game was around 70 GB, and it expanded to over 100 GB when fully unpacked. It was not an issue for me-- but it is certainly something to look out for, and is actually one of the major reasons people have been compaining about errors (the game has to decompress files on the fly and fails to load them in time, causing issues).I have not played multiplayer, and do not plan to, it probably sucks.In short:-- We were promised a semblance of realism and historical accuracy. We got nothing.-- We were promised a human/soldier oriented plot indicating the racial tensions of the time. We got nothing.-- We were promised a solid competitor to Battlefield 1. We got an inspired piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥-- We were promised a ""return to roots"" for the series. We got a rehashing of old glory, with large chunks lifted from other series'.I am ashamed to admit having preordered this game."

												Really wanted this to not be like previous iterations where it's beyond ridiculous, but there's just nothing of value here.In 2017, we still have to deal with matchmaking for games, no server browser, terrible netcode and unbalanced weapons. Loads of cheaters and heaps of mid-20's males acting like children. There is no hope for Call of Duty. The game needs a new formula because this hasn't worked for years.As for the single player, while I liked the story, the game was way too short. Call of Duty used to be known for these epic single player stories that were really good then right out of nowhere, you're kicked in the balls and the feels train is running full steam. WW2's single player was nothing like that. There was no memorable moments or points where you felt really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the situation. There's a part of the story where it explains a situation during a different battle where a bunch of soldiers are killed because the CO didn't want to leave them behind. It would have been amazing to be able to have that as a level, not just some passing thing. So many missed opportunities to have this as such a refreshing game, but it's just the same old, reskinned.

												Do NOT buy this game!! (yet at least)As a reasonably long term COD player (COD4 onwards) I've played a good few game and in my view - COD is getting worse. Its no secret that they no longer care about PC players but still considering we pay a reasonable amount would would expect the same game as consols etc.So far I'ce only played MP (about 15hrs ish) so I cant comment on the SP - Clan members say its OK if a bit short though.So onto MP. We'll its an improvement over the horrible flying c*ap that COD have produced lately but its not good either. Sadly COD has fallen into the trap, as alot of other publishers, of releasing an unfinished game, charging full money for it, and hoping that either no-one notices/ complains enough or that they can fix it later.The game is SO full of bugs its past the funny stage and actually affecting enjoyment of the game. In my honest opinion this game should be in Early Access as its in the same state as other FPS like PUBG.Anyway onto the review. The game plays well (when it works) and without stupid flying mechanics and back to old school run and gun. Snipers feel a bit OP at the moment but that could either be the damage output or the ease of use (either that or everyone with a sniper than no do no-scope headshots...cant say).current issues I'ce personnaly found (there are more supposedly on the forums);1. Orders - these are there in addition to the standard challenges and give you targets to achieve (win 5 games etc) and come in daily / weekly orders. All OK. except they are so bugged its annoying. They will regularly disappear after you've spent ages trying to achieve them. And by this I mean the entire orders page will go blank so all your challenges are lost. But you wont be able to get any more because the game still thinks youve got some.2. Still on orders. Some times (alot) these wont complete because you will ""lose connection with host"" once the game ends. You'll rejoin immediatly but progress is lost. Or sometimes even if you do exactly what it states it will/wont give you credit.3. Class reset - theres a bug that resets some of your classes after every game. So you have to redo them in between every, single, game4. Classes again - sometime you will lose the ability to edit any of your classes in relation to the atatchements. They just wont be there and theres nothing you can do to either change them or add them if your starting leveling up your weapon. So you have to play more games with no attachements untioll it fixes its self.5. Emblems - PC doesnt have the ability to create them. Consols do. No idea why. Second class I guess. Also we dont have competetive play either - again consols do. 6. Team setup - The game is a nightmare trying to get a stable party together with your friends. It will show them as in the party then join a game without them. It will kick one or two after a match but not tell you etc. Its bugged and doesnt work very well. Also some times friends wont be able to join your party if you invite them, but if they invite you it might work.7. Lost connections - Its amazing how many times you will lose connection during a single hour of play. You will be sitting in lobby waiting on agame and then get bumped back to the main intor screen. Just happens8. Multiplayer - again were having matchmaking forced on us and no server browser. Why people like have the ability to chose taken away from them I dont know, however this one doesnt work. You WILL spend upto 5mins waiting on matchmaking sorting a game out, watching players appear, disappear, reappear etc and not because they are leaving - just because the matchmaking isnt right. Also regardless of what map you pick - it might just change it and through you into a nearly complete game anyway - with or without your team / party9. Moving along same lines you will wait patiently in matchmaking, watching people join / leave etc just hoping that this time you get to play with your friends when you will get bumped back to the main screen with a session is full message - why is matchmaking trying to join a full session? If only there was server browser you could join a team, in seconds, with your friends.10. and more on the same. We're constantly told that MP is vi dedicated servers - could be true. I cant prove them wrong, except every now and then you will be playing and get a ""Host Migration"" message. the game will freeze and then restart in a few seconds. Sounds like P2P to me....never had host migration on a dedicated server before - and I know I run / used to run a few for COD411. hotboxes - either these are huge (i.e. for consol) or the killcam is way off. My hope is the kill cam isnt accurate but my fear is the hitboxes are shocking. You'll get killed from shots nowhere near you. what looks to be dead on will miss.  Bit of a joke TBH.12.Lag - loads - probably tied to matchmaking again. in the UK you will be playing with russians etc and the pings arent numbers - those stupid bars again but dont be suprised to see them very low and orange / sometimes red during the game. Still watchin people teleport past you is fun yeah? 13. Hardcore - once agin the HC community is screwed over. Softcore game mode has 9 playlists, HC has 4. 14. Carentan - great map and advertised. However they diodnt mention its only on softcore mode. Oh and you cant play this with your friends either. You have to join on your own and hope that your firends a) get in the same game and b) and on your team.15. other - so there are quiet a few other issues just to do with graphics, emote etc. There is one lugh on the finish screen where the guy looks like hes trying to lick his own ar*ehole. How did this pass any sort of quality control?There are quiet a few other issues. One or two of the above wouldnt be an issue and would be along the lines of what you would expect game to be like now that no developer has to ""finish"" their game before release however the number of flaws is totally unacceptable. It makes this a frustration play at least, not fun at all.One good point - in over 15hrs MP play I havent seen one hacker / cheater yet. Tehre have been plenty of kids shouting hacker etc - you know the type ""he killed he and im L££t therfore hes a hacker etc"", but no true cheaters. I may just have been lucky who knows but I've still not met any (yet)Overall the game is unfinished and has major flaws. If you dont mind paying full price for an Early Access game go ahead and buy. Otherwise I'd wait till new year and see if they have fixed it yet.As for proper competetive game play unless they decide to allow rentable dedis then this game wont last."

												If you want to the play the game for the online and zombies sure go for it, but you won't get much out the campaign. Its got a good story line, but there isn't much play time, even on vet it took like 7 hours to run threw everything only reason being you die faster and med packs are limited and don't heal as much, another weird thing about the campaign is that the save spots can be stupid, the game will load you once you die in a position where die again, (since on vet is like 2 hits dead) meaning you have restart the mission. So i am also guessing on anything lower then vet, the game can be finished in under 5 hours.I played a bit of the multiplayer and thought it was bland after spending about 1 hour trying to get into a game that is, 80% of shooting is hip fire, why do you even need to aim? oh hit markers are still a thing and can pound 20 bullets into some 1 and not die, while you get 3 hit. Maybe i've just gotten♥♥♥♥♥♥ who knows, but to me it felt bland and i've played every cod to max prestige pretty much.personaly I don't think the game is that good, maybe with a bit more play time online i might chanage my mind but for now it doesn't feel good. So i played online for a bit more and i hate it the weapons are crap, they feel unblanced and killing people just feels like a ♥♥♥♥ing challange even when you're htting them from behind with no knowledge of them knowing you're there, i've lost fight to people who are using a pistal and i've already put 20 bullets into them, plus fighting people isn't even skill full it just run in move side to side and hip fire till some one dies, oh yet lets not get started with the sniping, who needs weapons when you can hit poeple with a sniper at close range with 0 aiming. Out of all the cods i've played this one feels like the ♥♥♥♥♥est online game play. (update The online is the worst ever made, even the future♥♥♥♥♥♥was better, go waste your money on something else because this game is a flop)To pay £45 for the game and get 7 hours of campaign game play on (vet), an online experince which isn't that good, servers being crap with major lags and crap gun balancing, atm it doesn't feel worth it.

												The game is good, but not worth MSRP. I loved the campaign; there were some quorks with accuracy like weapon placement, but i think that was to allow the player more gun choices during the beginning. Controls are really customizable, frame rate is ALWAYS solid DURING gameplay, but is extremely choppy during cutscenes (GTX 970 4gb). Story is SOOOOO good. I loved every second of it......... HERE'S THE BAD PART:	I reallllllly like the classic COD games - WaW, MW2, MW3, BO - but this game took a direction that I didn't think they were going to take. With the reintroduction to Nazi Zombies I expected gameplay mechanics, story and how the story was told, perks, etc to be similar to that of the classics; but it wasn't. It took the direction that BO3 took in its mechanics etc, added its own stuff and branded NAZI ZOMBIES. Of course multiplayer really didn't change any and picking your ""starting classes"" is pretty unnecassary. It could have been a really cool concept, like planetside 2 where its a battle over the countries, but it wasnt and it makes me sad.SUMMARYZombies changed when i didnt want it to, multiplayer stayed the same, and the story was amazing, but who buys a COD game soley for the story? If you like the things i stated, get it. But if not, expect to refund it like i did."

												As someone who has played multiple cods and played more than an hour of this one, I can say this game is♥♥♥♥♥ (The multiplayer launcher is seperate and the time i played isnt recorded on the singeplayer launcher, which is the time played you see on this review.)The multiplayer is inconsistent as all hell. I don't remember in those ""Boots on the ground"" games, that mashing A and D was a tactic to never ever be hit. Add that to this games literal♥♥♥♥♥♥pile that is hit registration and you have one of the worst experiences ever. I never feel confident about any gun im using because I can't go from gunfight to gunfight knowing how my gun will react. I go into every encounter hoping to the gods that this thing doesnt take 7+ hits to kill while watching the enemy use the exact same thing but in a quarter of the shots. I assume this has something to do with people saying servers are♥♥♥♥♥♥ well tough♥♥♥♥♥♥thats no damn excuse for a multi-billion dollar company to give its consumers.  There is no part of this multiplayer that is, even in the slightest, rewarding. Even with the wins, the amount of pain and suffering one has to endure just to finish a ♥♥♥♥ing match is unbearable. On top of having to get a 10 kill streak just for a ♥♥♥♥ing recon plane in domination???The Zombies is great, albeit i havent played all too much of it. But the bits I did play made me♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants if thats any indication of how they changed it. The playable characters are okay but they will never replace the original four. The campaign... no. I liked the cutscenes sort of? But the characters didnt feel real and the squad mechanic is stupid.Id rather find health packs and ammo packs over having to wait for this guy to♥♥♥♥♥♥one out for me. Overall, I find the game unfinished in many aspects and honestly just not fun. I'm not hating to hate, because I genuinely wanted to play this game non-stop as soon as it came out but as soon as i start, its nothing but rage and ludicrous amounts of frustration at how unfinished it really is. Literally walking away from my computer at times because I just can't comprehend how some of the things in this game actually made it to launch and even 3 days post launch. I will however be giving it more playtime and maybe my opinion will change but 25 hours in and not enjoying it is not a good sign."

												Should you buy this game? It's why you're here so i'll tell ya straight up. Only if your looking for your standard COD FPS. If your looking for anything else...don't buy it. If you wanna know more keep reading.The campaign is mostly boring, painfully repetitive, and wholly unoriginal. It's littered with bugs, crashes, screen tearing and connection issues. The balancing in its multiplayer is against you 8/10 times and it's littered with microtransactions every step of the way.It's graphics are pretty good, its sound is pretty spot on but nothing to be admired. In my experience the story line was boring and just....well it was supposed to make you feel like your in a squad and you're living though the war but thats not what you feel. You just feel like your doing the same thing over and over again and trying to care about these people you know nothing about and never get to learn much about either.As for the multiplayer, its standard. Sometimes its fun sometimes it's not. As for me? I've been hitting bugs and crashes since the begining, the damn thing is almost not playable because of how much it crashed. Couldn't even play the campaign without crashes unless I made it windowed mode and lowered my graphics all the way (and i've got a damn good PC).And in multiplayer I keep getting the same error, no help from activision and from what i've read online no one else who gets this error gets any help either. So we're just stuck. I hope steam will give me a refund because I CANNOT play this game. Only buy this game if you want to give yourself a headache. The constant crashes, bugs, disconnections and screen tearing will make you foaming at the mouth angry. Don't buy it, don't support these companies who sacrifice quality for...well idk what their sacrifcing it for. Microtransactions i guess? Anyway I hope this helped...don't buy it."

												Absolutely not worth your money. The only decent part of this game is zombies, truly. Multiplayer is a joke, the maps feel terribly small and the gun textures look like legos. Mostly just 10-13 year olds who play non stop, but what did you expect, really... The campaign is almost halfway decent, but the AI's are annoying as hell and it took me about an hour to breeze through it. I'm definitely not going to buy another COD game after this trainwreck of a game. If you want to pay 60$ for a game, go get Destiny 2 and spare yourself some trouble.Update: I have gotten at least 4 supply drops now and they seem to have disappeared. Good ole' COD pulling through again, not afraid to screw their player base. 10/10Update: After playing for a while I realised that it was worse than I though. It's almost equivalent to playing Nerf with a bunch of 12 year olds, but what did I expect, an actual campaign and a multiplayer whose fanbase wasn't 12 year olds yelling n**ger in my ear, forget it. They've lost my interest and money forever.Update: I wonder if the devs did any research before actually making the game. As a person who loves world war 2, seriously, go look at how many hours I have in H&G and HOI4, this game is a complete letdown.Let's start with the guns:MG42- Probably shoots around 400 rpm in the game, if that, the gun actually was well known for shooting upwards of 1000 rpm. And a 50 round mag, seriously, my little brother has nerf guns with more capacity.I hate to keep using Nerf as an example because it makes Nerf look bad, but seriously, this game feels like i'm shooting a Nerf gun. Did ANY of the devs live fire the guns they were creating... probably safe to say they didn't.Let's talk maps, now, I think that being one of the largest if not the largest war in human history, they would have plenty of room on continental europe to create historically accurate maps.

												TERRIBLE GAME.This is one of the laziest FPS I have ever played. The characters are shallow and unlikeable. The battles are uninteresting and didn't even taken place half the time. The armoured train mission for example? This never ♥♥♥♥ing happened why is it in the game? You can't name a game WW2 and make up historical events. Isn't Operation Market Garden exciting enough? or crossing the Rhine? No we get an made up missions where you have to take the German H.Q in Paris which mostly envolves choosing the correct pass word. Non-stop action....... Half the time I couldn't find a decent gun so had to make do with a bolt action rifle. The guns are awful!The combat is linear and scripted to high heaven. All the most exciting bits like with every COD is taken out of your hands and you are reduced to tapping the F key like crazy to avoid being stabbed or buggered.....and as with all Call of Duty games the fighting is largely one shot to kill. Very boring after ten minutes......arcade like.It's mainly unimmersive, uninteresting, lazy and boring. If you have a low I.Q and demand little from your games but aimless shooting then their is much to enjoy here........if you demand, well written characters, an immersive story and realistic historical situations then keep looking.I don't play multiplayer as I don't particularly find endlessly running around shooting the same people to be in an way enteraining. But I imagine multiplayer like all multiplayer is repetative and dull. But each to their own.We live in an age where more and more single player games are left by the way side and replaced with mindless multiplayer games with very little effort or care being taken in their production and those games who do have singleplayer campiagns are short and are nothing more than a mere foot note against multiplayer. This is no exception.Considering the budgets these stuidos have and the decade of game making they have under their belts its nothing short of discusting have they could produce such rubbish as this. But we all know multiplayer is where the money is, because idiots love playing it and making micro transactions so they can have a pink gun or a peace sign on their helmet.Sigh...........How is it possible to make WW2 boring? How can you make D-Day boring? How?I won't be playing COD again.....This game is over priced, badly made and a disgrace to other WW2 shooters and the FPS genre as a whole.Would be nice if Valve could make an intelligent FPS......Oh wait they only caree about money too. YAY!Call of Duty is well and truly dead. When will we get an intelligent FPS? WHEN?!!!!!Lazy, boring, badly written, poorly made crap.2/10"

												Not what I wanted out of WWII game.  I wasn't expecting COD 1 or 2, but something closer to them.  Not the ""standard"" COD formula that was developed with MW... it was great the first two times, but I grew tired of it by BLOPS.  The maps I've tried still feel like compact arena lanes, and I might have enjoyed them more if they had modernized some of their older maps like Carentan or Harbor.  I would also have liked to see bigger maps maybe with vehicles; where teamwork is more meaningful.  The game looks and runs great.  Can maintain 144+ FPS @ 1080p with everything maxed and AA on with a GTX 1080 with older drivers.  The mouse movement is buttry smooth.  The game is installed on a SSD (poor thing is maxed out now), so load times are pretty decent.  All the mechanics perform very well.I hate the sounds.  They nailed the Garand's ""ping"" beautifully, but every shot with any weapon I've tried sounds like a jumbled sub bass mess of an explosive fart; which is great if you have an AssKicker attached to your chair.  But otherwise gun fire is just underwhelming, and lacking any presence.  Thought they would have updated this after E3 response.If I wanted realism, I would go play ARGO/Arma III or anything similar.  I enjoy the faster pace arena shooters, but I did not want this to be the same old COD.  There is no weapon restriction in MP for your selected faction because they kept the old class loadout mechanic.  It bothers me that a German can spawn with a Garand instead of an unscoped Kar98, or an American with a STG44.  They should have done something more innovated to address this.Is the game worth $60? Sure, why not.  Cost of living has only gone up since most games went to the $60 price tag.  Little curious on how much it did cost to produce this game without marketing.  Will I refund the game?  IDK, maybe I'll learn to love it.I cannot recommend this game if you're tired of COD.  It is the same repackaged COD they've been doing the last 10 years.  If you love the same thing they've been doing, you're right at home.  Enjoy."

												I was expecting a COD title, bringing me back to my very first experiences with this franchise. Silly me.The game itself runs just fine, have had absolutely no issues, crash, lag or frame issues. Controls feels a bit sluggish, but after and adjustment in sensitivity, that was working as intended.However.... As an old fart, it would have been nice, with the option for a bootcamp, so I wouldn't throw smoke grenades, trying to lean right, doing nothing on Z and X. The last thing may be me, playing more Arma than COD.All weapons you find on the beach are Kar98( fine by me) and PPSH. WHAT THE EFFIN ♥♥♥♥ IS THAT RUSSIAN PEACE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥GUN DOING HERE!!! I kind a like the old style touches, with medkits being picked up, and not just healing up, when getting into cover, and the helmets flying upwards, when landing a headshot-brings back memories from old COD games.AI teammates are getting in the way, blocking grenade throws and level design is filled with absolutely useless♥♥♥♥♥♥ just artwork, with poor details, if you don't care enough to make the writing readable, don't add ♥♥♥♥ing writing on junk in the levels. Leveldesign also seems to get in the way of movement alot.Lastly I'm VERY disappointed by the poor quicktime events, where you have to align the move, and press some random button, it just feels odd and in the way.I've seen worse COD titles, but I've definately seen way better- so much for getting my hopes up, that sledgehammer would lift the bar and give COD a much needed reboot.Games technical level 6/10Games historical accuracy 2/10Game entirety 5/10= do not buy.."

												A backstab for all CoD fans, developers provided absolutely none improvement over the years.It cannot be compared to the progress of Battlefield series at all. Multiplayer maps are horrible, 8 out of 10 deaths being from behing or side due to ridiculous amount of ways to flank you. Everyone is basically running around in chaos, shooting everyone on sight. I will not say anything about the campaign - it´s short, just 6 hours to complete, P47 Thunderbolt mission is a dissapointment, the tank mission too. I mean, compared to the campaigns in the older CoD: United Offensive or CoD2 (ww2 games), it´s rubbish.I enjoyed the implementation of ""War"" mode, the concept makes players focus on the objective and makes dying a lot more ""fun"", as players would immediately want to respawn and rush back to the objective. Sadly, there are very few maps, which is going to be fixed by adding DLCs during 2018. These DLCs can be obtained via purchasing the ""Season Pass"", but this costs another 40€, which is complete rubbish.I regret buying this game and accept the fact that last ""good"" CoD was Modern Warfare 2 :("

												Port wise, it runs great. Probably the best running CoD title at launch to date. Plethora of options for people who want to really fine tune their experience. Gameplay wise, its a completely different story. I'll break it down into the three main modes, campaign, multiplayer, and zombies.Campaign: Miles ahead of any other CoD campaign to date, and it actually changes things up by making you rely on your squad for things like ammo and health kits (by the way, health does not auto regen in singleplayer). Really adds to the tension when you're pinned down with no health kits and have to make a desperate play to come out on top. Weapon selection is accurate to the era, but not to the front. For example, there are PPSH-41s on the beaches of Normandy. Yes, I know the German forces extensively used captured Soviet equipment, but it is simply impossible for those guns to have been transported from the eastern front that quickly over that much distance, especially when the Germans were busy fighting two fronts. For someone like me, who enjoys WW2 history, its very immersion breaking, but for the casual player it will not be an issue. The story is good, lots of drama in between shooting galleries of German soldiers. Other than the changes mentioned, its a pretty standard WW2 shooter. Overall I'd rate the singeplayer a 7/10.Multiplayer: Here's where stuff starts flying off the rails. This is absolutely the worst CoD multiplayer I've played in recent memory (yes, worse than Infinite Warfare). The absence of extended movement mechanics means everyone is back to classic CoD kiddie moves like dropshotting and quickscoping. At least with the other games, the combination of thrusters, sliding, and CQC options allowed for ways to combat tactics like those. This entire situation is made even more absurd when you realize that the art team painstakingly tried to make the environments as realistic to the era as possible, then you see your teammates doing 360s off artillery cannons trying to hit that dank noscope. Sledgehammer claims they were aiming for realism, and they've captured the 2009-era Modern Warfare 2 realism instead of the 1944 realism that the art and environments would have you believe. And this isn't even mentioning the server issues that have been plaguing this game nonstop since 12AM November 3rd. Wanna play multiplayer? Fetching online profile for thirty minutes, get into a game, play for 10 minutes, get an infinite black loading screen until you end the process manually. Rinse and repeat and you have CoD WW2 MP. I would give the multiplayer a rating, but it would be too low to be visible.Zombies: Here's where I thought this game would redeem itself, being created by the same guys who made Dead Space 2, they know horror, right? Well, it would be good, except for three major issues that I simply cannot look past. One, when you look at a zombie for the first time, it plays a high pitched violin sound a la Psycho accompanied by your character saying something along the lines of ""what the ♥♥♥♥ is that"" or ""OH HELL"". Now, this wouldn't be an issue if it only happened once or twice, but nope. It happens almost every single time you see a zombie you hadn't seen before. I'm not joking. Two, zombies can literally spawn out of thin air right behind you, jump down off a roof in front of you, or whatever. I get they were going for a jump scare horror tactic, but its not scary. Its goddamn annoying and saps my enjoyment even further. Three, the weapons in general suck. When you first start, you'll wonder what drugs I'm on, because the starting pistols are actually fairly powerful. But once you get past round 15, every single gun just becomes useless unless you pack it, then it becomes useless after round 20. Yes, this includes Mystery Box weapons. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention: the box only has like four spins before it locks and you need to find it again.Overall probably the worst CoD experience I've had to date, the only reason to buy this game would be for the campaign. Don't make the mistake I did and buy it for zombies. It's not worth your money. If you want a good CoD zombies experience, get Infinite Warfare or Black Ops 3. Or, if you don't want CoD, get Killing Floor 2.TL;DR don't buy it unless you want a good campaign"

												This game is great. Historically inaccurate by a huge margin, however getting a kill in the game is satistfying. The campaign's story is fairly solid, longer than the new battlefront 2's (my my, what an achievement). Multiplayer customisation is far from lacking (although this is mostly in the cosmetic sense) and ww2 zombies actually has a deeper level of customisation than bo3.Now you may be wondering why i do not recommend the game despite the praise im giving it...Hackers. ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere. I run into 5 different hackers per day and i only play for 2-3 hours max. It is a plague that needs fixing immediatly. Aimbot, shooting through walls, seeing through walls, you name it, someone will have hacked it into the game. Some hackers have been there since day 1 despite SHG promising that they will have an anticheat system in given how plagued the beta was. There isn't even a damn vote-kick system! Until a solid anti-cheat system is in place, DO NOT BUY!"

												I think we all wanted another great Call of Duty set in WWII (after Call of Duty 1, United Offensive, Call of Duty 2 and World at War) but this ain't it.- PC performance is awful: game regularly dips in single digit FPS when playing campaign or calling in scorestreaks.- You can customize your soldier. But then you find out there is zero customization for the German army, something you will be playing as HALF THE TIME in this game.- PC controls are awful: The tank missions in previous CODs were great, now they just lazily ported over console controls.- Cheaters are still a big problem. Not as many cheaters as in beta, but still enough wallhacking and aimbotting to ruin lots of games, and take away the fun.- Lootboxes and droprates on them are absolutely pathetic. This is done on purpose so Activision/Sledge could earn more money from selling them for real money.I wanted to give COD the benefit of the doubt, but after two weeks now with barely any meaningful patches, it's clear to me that the PC version is an afterthought. And that WWII doesn't magically make Call of Duty an amazing game, unless they put in some actual work.I still really enjoy war mode, and I will continue to play it for that mode alone. But this game does not live up to older COD titles and the PC version is quite frankly very, very poor."

												This review will be purely based on multiplayer regular and zombiesI think that overall COD WWII is a good game, not amazing and not terrible. However this was true for the week after launch, after that the problems started piling up for me at least. From about one week after launch the game had huge issues with simply connecting online. It would get stuck in fetching profile information, and if it was not that it would be failing to update. Now these issues i persisted through, but a bit later the dev team made a new patch they implemented that significantly reduced performance for me and everyone i know that play the game. Even the simple headquarters became a laggy mess.Now i think the game in its core is decent, but with some of the issues i cannot recommend it in good faith. At least not to another player who would have to pay a very high price for a game that only has a decent multiplayer. I believe that some of the earlier call of duty titles have balanced gameplay and made innovation to gameplay. But this is at best a downgrade from COD World at War which i would consider a superior game, even though it was released 9 years ago. It feels like an insult to the franchise that a lot of people already consider garbage. Even for a call of duty title i consider this one bland, the strengths of the franchise were stripped away to simplicity. Even zombies gamemode is a lobotomized version of its former self with too many objectives and things that have to be done. I always believed the strength of zombies was its simplicity, that anyone could play it and enjoy it no matter their knowledge of the map or the game.Another matter entirely is the influx of cheaters that are gradually increasing and destroying the game. I do not feel confident that this matter will improve over time. I would like to say that I hope most issues with this game will be resolved, but after roughly 40 hours in the game I will most probably not return to play it again after this mediocre title. I entirely respect the people that understand and see the flaws of the game and continue playing, and I for their sake the issues are resolved sooner rather than later. I refrained from playing Call of Duty titles for years in hopes that when I came back the gameplay would feel refreshing. Turns out the type of refreshing I was about to feel is the same type as when you drive towards farmland and you can taste the smell of♥♥♥♥♥♥on your skin.As far as the game goes i would not recommend it at its current stage. At the very least i'd recommend caution in buying the title unless you know specifically what you are buying it for, like for example zombies or the single player. And even then I would recommend you only buy it when the price drops lower. Which knowing a call of duty title will not be for years."

												The campaign has many bugs and issues with it1. Shading does not work properly as in many of the missions you can visably see 'squares as the shadows' instead of a clean line2.Mouse and Keyboard do not work properly with many of the missions, for instance, the missions where you need to control a plane is nearly impossible as it takes too sharp of a turn when trying to move around. I am able to change my mouse DPI but it has no effectThe multiplayer1. is non-cooperative with me as i constantly see people moving around the mapin a studdery manner2. It seems that they have added the beta instead of the full game release as many of the implementations from the beta have been removed.I have played the campaign as i was most excited for that, but it was a total let down with many bugs and glitches in it. The multiplayer is not finished and has many bugs with it.If you only want to buy it for the campaign go for it, but, I would not reccomend you to buy this game if you look for any other feature such as multiplayer. For zombies i did not play it as it did not seem interesting enough to me."

												This's a hard one guys, I wish that one day steam adds a ""meh"" score. It's not bad nor it is good, campaign is quite under whelming and I play War mode in multiplayer 99.8% of the times which is by far my favorite part of the game. There are very few number of guns available for each category which makes the progression abit frustrating. Zombie mode is good with friends of course but ANY game is better with friends however me and my friends were abit put-off because they didn't include any CO-OP campaign mode. As for port report, It certainly is trying to be a good port but I'm experiencing weird screen tearing and FPS fluctuations and sometimes my settings keep changing.

And because ot the P2P system the game keeps lagging and freezing and only 1 person has a stable connection because he is the host."

												Such a dissapointment. Thought CoD was finally making a change. I made the mistake of putting the game on ""launch when ready"" before I left for work for the initial setup on the 3rd. Already had more then two hours by the time I got back and realized how pathetic this game is. Quite honestly the game itself is okay, but there are so many historical innacuracies and general ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that you usually find in CoD along with the server issues just make me feel sick to my stomach that I wasted a 100 dollars on this garbage. It overall feels unpolished compared to my personal favorite WW2 game, Heroes and Generals, which is a FREE TO PLAY. I tried putting a few more hours into it to see if it would just suddenly become fun (why not I spent 100 dollars already, idiot). Absolute waste of money for anyone who likes to get their moneys worth. The really pathetic part is that this game will be forgotten with next years release. Never buying a CoD game ever again no matter how good the trailers are or what subject it is. I want a refund.Seriously debating removing from my accound because it makes me sick to look at it in my library.Edit for people who are claiming my review is fake because steam says I only have .4 hours. Comments copied and pasted below.I played the multiplayer for 9 hours. Steam is only counting my time in the campaign for some reason. I was mistaken by this too as I read it as .4 and thought I could get a refund, but steam support let me know that I actually had 6 hours and 37 minutes, thus my realization.And as additional proof, here are some screenshots.https://imgur.com/a/s8JjA And I stand by H&G being at least more polished then this game, with matches with way more players with way more vehicles, guns, actual historical accuracy (to a point), and still running much smoother even at higher resolutions."

												This is regarding the multiplayer experience only. I am sure the single player is fine but I didn't buy this game for that.I was a big fan of the orginal CoD and CoD 2. I was happy when they brought CoD back to PC for MW and played a ton of WaW. Since then I have not played much of the series. I was excited about this title marking a return to WWII era shooters plus the developers commitment to bringing the series back to the PC gaming community. The WAR mode is very fun for me as I love objective based team play and it reminded me of another long loved game Enemy Territory.  However I am disappointed with the state of the game as I am writing this. The connection issues are non stop and when there is finally a match you end up in a lobby with people running cheats. There is no vote to kick function so all you can do is lick your wounds and retreat and hope you do not get matched back in the same lobby (which usually happens). The reporting function doesn't seem like it is enough to solve the issue.  WAR mode while being very fun as it is misses the mark by only having 3 levels. I am hopeful they will add more as they release new content.Overall until some serious game breaking issues get addressed I cannot recommend this game."

												I'm usually the type of person to play all Call of Duty's near the time they're released. But this time i wanted something new and refreshing to the franchise; something that wouldn't feel like a plain 'copy and paste' with a few additions of small integrations from other games. I played this game for 15+ hours and i can finally say that i do not at all, like this game. The campaign is average, characters feel bare bones, the action set pieces are usually structured in a tiny areas, no real in-depth experiences of harsh war that we were promised. This campaign, does not feel like WWII. You are always set to follow a certain path and feel really restrciting with invisible walls, and you can't help but feel that you are not in a battlefeld of any sorts so it just feels like they're trying to make a great story here, but instead i feel it just takes away the atmosphere for a WWII game. What also doesn't help is the fact you are stuck for the entire game, only seeing from the the American side, fighting the Nazi's who apparently either have laser precision, or had training from a toddler. The A.I. is bad. Where is the French resistance? Where are the parts of gritty war that no human should ever fatham? Up my ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ theres nothing like that. Now multiplayer, the part everyone (including me) loves for its simplicity. It is also paimfully average. The guns look like they should, and sound like they should. But there is no need to use anything besides the Assault rifles or sniper rifles. Everything else has no real purpose. The killstreaks however are pretty cool, being able to take control of almost all the killstreaks makes you feel that its not restrciting like the rest of the game feels. The maps are very tiny. Eh a lot more so in this game than any of the others surpisingly, each of which have three paths; left right or middle. Middle is always a death trap leading you to an open plot of nothingness, and right and left both look exactly the same. Both have a building at both sides while you wait and shoot, proceed to their side and try to flank, only tro find out the spawns have switched or they're spawning behind you or even in front of you. Its most noticable in this game since it has small maps and i cpuldnt tell you how many times ive found myself spawning next to someone. The gamemodes are fine, expect for war which is, a bit innovative? I say a bit becasue its copied from Battlefield 1, which is just domination with 3 maps in one and with tanks that feel oddly placed and can barely move anywhere. Finally the new Divisions. They don't bring anything new, 2 of them feel far more superior than the other. All in all, i dont enjoy it but has a few neat additions whihc are amussing to begin with.And the zombies. Plainly it's bad, the characters are alright but barely say anything. I bought a sniper rifle and my guy made a joke about willies. All it made me do is sell the wapon. the dialogue is cery off, timing for most of it doesnt make sense, or is very delayed, and the zombies themselves look alright. The map you're given id very bland, and barely looks like its from WWII without properly looking at objects. They miixed this all in with a progressions system, which again has some that are clearly superior than others. Would you like to be able to drop off a nuke, or start off with 10% more ammo? You're starting gun only has 80 bullets meaning you'll only get 8 more bullets than everyone else, which you'll completely ignore, and end up buying a gun, which may i add will NOT have 10% more ammo because its only for what gun you start off with. All in all its okay for a few tries but everything here gets way too repetitive. This game overall get's a 6 / 10! It's slightly above average"

												In general this game is disappointment.I bought it because I hoped it would be cool. But it’s a waste of money.So, my primary concern regarding the sigleplayer is a really dumb AI.Your companions are pretty useless and make your life harder.All the Germans are aiming at you only. Because of that this game is awful to play in highest difficulty.Multiplayer is a cover version of BF1 with the smaller maps.No realism, stupid skins, collimator sighs for WW2 weapons and, of course, avatars with the gay flags of all their denominations, how could you make a WW2 game without it!aIf you’re are looking for accurate, solid and modern WW2 shooter you’re better take a look at Day of Infamy."

												This is my review of the latest installment of the call of duty franchise: cod ww2, this isnt going to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review since I didnt drop 50$ on the other titles in my library.*WARNING THIS GAME IS DYING*http://steamcommunity.com/app/476620/discussions/0/1620600279666583223/?tscn=1515215360So the game takes place in 1944 during D-Day since we don't have a million western front games on the market already but whatever. Its like saving private ryan where you have squad members that can give you things like HP, ammo and power ups (it outlines every enemy purple to make them easier to see) who you're supposed to feel connected too since this pushes a more narrative driven story unlike other call of duty games (unless its waw-blops 2) This isn't as interesting since if you've seen saving pvt ryan you have basically seen these characters, you eventually go through missions pushing to germany then ww2 is over, you get the jist since its ww2Campaign pros/consProsThe only thing I can really think of is the french spy mission, it's like the black bird mission in black ops 1 where you switch from covert to guns blazing to covert again, other than that there's nothing really memorable since its the western front done over and over again.Cons-Enemies either have an extra chromosome and will go to cover in front of you (normal) or have the most precise razor sharp accuracy so if you expose your toe they'll end up shooting it off, there's no inbetween, its either painfully difficult or extremely easy.- Enemies and battles are determined not by how many you kill like in MW2 where there were a finite amount of enemies in a level so you can kill all of them and move on, but in cod ww2 they are set by triggers so there are an infinite amount of enemies until you touch something so the enemies retreat even if they were destroying you, this makes it so I could just run and gun to the next trigger and the germans would retreat and die.-Allies are completely worthless, all enemies aimlock onto you and your allies either just sit behind cover waiting for you to kill the germans.- when enemies blind fire from cover on hardened they are 100% accurate-D-Day landings are 5 minutes at mostThats it, 5/10 since its just the western front that's been seen a thousand times nothing too interesting.MultiplayerIts what most people buy cod for since you can get hours of enjoyment from playing it, there are some gripes like no swastikas and the black female german soldiers (lol) that definitely break the WW2 feeling since the women screams and war cries and louder than the explosions and gunfire for some reason and they end up sounding like dying rats. Cod ww2 also brings in the new war mode which was aimed at a prime selling point, but this is extremely underwhelming when there are only 3 maps and we are going to get ONE in the next dlc, this is also bad since there were already more maps in the beta files that they could have added since we only have NINE MAPS COMPARED TO 14-16 THAT OTHER GAMES HAVE, this is very disappointing since the map designs are so bad! Now let me address them…All of the nine maps follow a very simple and boring design that I have never seen such laziness in a call of duty game before EVER! The map design consists of 3 lanes with a connector in the middle on ALL of them this leads to matches playing the same over and over again since  flank options and power spots are non existent in this game, the battles end up playing on 1-2 lanes on the map and it will stay like that for the rest of the match I am so disappointed that all of the maps are like this and it is an INSULT to anyone who has a slight knowledge in very very basic game design.This is a mini annoyance for me and its the female soldiers, no swastikas and lgbt/interracial/degenerate calling cards (who at sledge thought these were a good Idea?) these break the ww2 feel that at this point should be impossible to mess up at this point in time since there are tons of ww2 games that get the feel right.Multiplayer pros/conspros-Variants, these are reskins done right! They don't just reskin the weapon you get an entirely new model for the gun like a gritty m1 garand or elegant FG42 and I just want to thank (raven software?) for doing this as they are a very good addition to the game-Weapon sounds feel satisfying ranging from just shooting it to simply putting the magazine into it.-War mode is very fun though it only has 3 maps-You can change your characters modelsNow to the cons-9 maps -All follow the three lane design-annoying leftist add-ins-Sapply darps (let me cover this)Supply dropsIts very sad that its common place for these to be in full 60$ release games now a days, the game gives you chances to get them completely free and I like that but its whats inside that messes it up. You can LITERALLY get DUPLICATE DUPLICATES. Let me explain, there are taunts in the game which you can use in the HQ and at the end of a round which is ok I guess, but when opening  a supply drop there are multiple ‘’variants’’ of the same taunt, for example there is a simple ‘’hi’’ taunt where your character just waves and it says hi in the chat (the chat is microscopically small so no point in this) and there is the ‘’whats buzzin’’ taunt. Both taunts do the EXACT same animation the only difference is there being  a text pop up, so this means if you get ‘’hi’’ you can get an exact duplicate ‘’whats buzzin’’ I remember getting 3 salute taunts, all the same thing just with one text change making them all duplicates of each other. Could they not think of anything else to add to the supply drops? Like maybe little exclusive emblems and badges to put on your gun like csgo stickers? It is so mind numbingly dumb how they couldn't have made anything else, also they have pistol grips which you won't see since your hand is on them, nice.This game had a lot of wasted potential but I feel it will end up like ghosts, it has  a crappy start but then the devs add stuff too little too late."

												The game is unplayable because of cheaters. Before the launch creators of this game PROMISED in writing that there will be an anti-cheat system. Well ‘surprisingly’ there is NON. This was the ONLY reason I returned to COD after 2 years. Such a waste of money.If you get lucky enough to find a game without hackers here are other issues that makes you tired of playing.-	There are only 9 maps. After a month of playing it got boring real fast. Older games had 16 large maps. Now they are selling extra maps where they were supposed to be already included in the base for free.-	Map designs are all horrible and they all are exactly the same. There are 3 straight lanes you can go. Choose one: Left, middle and right. I miss old bigger maps where you can engage enemies in multiple sections of the map. In this game there is only one place to engage and that is to meet in the middle.-	Horrible spawns. You can see online videos showing spawns right NEXT TO enemies. -	Hitmarkers don’t register 50% of the time. Normally you hit enemy with 1-2 bullets and get a kill in hardcore mode. Sometimes you hit them 3-4 times and they don’t die. This happens in ALL game modes with ALL guns. There is a mechanical problem in the code.-	 The Create a Class (perk) system is extremely restrictive. You will NEVER setup your usual COD class because some of the most important and popular perks are NOT optional. For example, you can never play Stealth.I was spending hours without realizing when I was playing MW, MW2, MW3, BO1, BO2… I was pumped to play every day after I got home. But with this game, after 15 minutes I get bored every time.  I was playing older games for a year until the new one comes out. But this one got really repetitive after 2 months. I am very disappointed and sad."

												After having finished the campaign, and have played just enough of the MP and Zombies Mode, I have to say the game is at most, worth $50 CAD, and that's just me being nice. The game's campaign is emotionally touching, and really puts me in perspective of many of the soldiers that have died on the beach of Normandy (May they rest in Peace). However, when we're dealing with MP, I didn't really enjoy it. I've played many shooters in my life and all of them had something to really set them apart but CoD failed to deliver that, with exception to ""War"" the only mode that's unique to this game. It also disappointed me that, there is only one online zombies map, ""The Final Reich"", and I honestly hope they release 2 FREE maps, because they might've not as well even gave us Zombies at this point. Seriously, one map? I would've even accepted a Remaster of Kino Der Toten. Well, that's my review for it. Take it as you will."

												Call of laggy WWII is an abomination made by lackofvision. I have to say i got tricked by their promise to return to WII.Campaign is lackluster and even with my gtx 1080 16gb ram i have some stutter for cutscenes. Textures are pretty bad for AAA developer. Gone is regenerating health, healthpacks are around the maps and you can call in grenades and others from your team mates. Not bad but by the times you ask, catch and use a healthpack you're shredded on veteran difficulty. Stealth is also ridiculous, killed like 10 Germans in a mission and they just went to every corpse i made and started further looking for me, no general alarm. Story is the same generic garbage Hollywood has been recycling for decades and comes straight from the scriptwriters of Band Of Brothers/Saving Private Ryan. Also keybindings sucked. Often in a qte sequence i had to press 'unbound' to win. So of course got killed as apparently the game forgot which key i had to use.Multiplayer is laggy at times you can't see ping. At end of match you often get disconnected so losing all xp.Same maps over and over 50m width 50m depth. Kill 1 or 2 guys get shot in back and repeat. It's fun for a while but is getting very tiresome now after 20 hours. I'm almost close to prestige 1 and getting 21 daily order done for achievements and will then never touch it again. Best addition is warmode, the objective driven mp, that feels a lot like the far superior Battlefield 1 Rush/Frontlines.Headquarters as a social hub isn't that spectacular either, you can do some 1vs1 arena, and see other guys getting lootboxes...Also their is absolutely no anticheat on this game. Devs just say on forum sent us videoproof and we'll ban reported players. Good job...Haven't played zombies yet, never been a fan of it, but might give it a chance."

												Edit: tl:dr2: Your purchase has been refunded by Steam.This is based on ONLY 2,something hours of single player experience just upon on release, second hardest difficulty level. Edit: I tried multiplayer, one match and I guess it was what's to be expected of COD - random respawn points, dot sights, no team play, just an ordinary death match as we remember it from Quake.tl:dr Right now I can't recommend if you're going for a single player experience and also the sound is broken (crackling starts at some point, meaning you need to switch output to something else and then back. Scroll to bottom for more). Also the sound is just a very weak point.+ Game looks good- Sound is broken- Sound is very bad and unconvincing unless connected to the above- AI is stupid- Constant music that can't be turned off.  + Voice acting is tolerable+ Did I mention it looks good?+You can make a satisfying bayonet charge as in BF:1.I bought this game because I'd like to play the singleplayer. Yes, I know, it's risky, but I did it anyway.The game starts out intensely on a beach we all know too well from many games and movies. It's pretty good. I guess. At least you know what's going on without having to be told. And it looks gorgeous. Then you start killing Nazis. And that's fine too, except I'd expect a Nazi going down with a shot to the chest from a .30 round. Headshots luckily kill instantly and it makes the helmet fly as in so many many other games. So I've seen hundreds of COD:WWII-Nazi helmts shoot into air from my bullet penetrating Nazi brains. Brains that aren't all that functional. That cerebral dysfunction goes for your teammates as well. They'll site somewhere stupid and gaze empty headed into the opposite direction of where the fight is going on for a sec until remembering where the action is. They'll also let you take all the initiative making them more than useless for anything other than resupplying and pointlessly telling you what to do or what you've just done ""nice shot"", yeah, suck my baw bag you empty headed bint. One thing the Nazis do have is an incredible hive mind, meaning if you blow the head of one everyone around him will instantly know from which direction the shot came. Also, they'll completely ignore your teammates and direct all fire at you instead. Seems legit.  There's a check point system that saves often which is great, nothing is more frustrating than too far between autosaves and too bad a memory to remember saving. However, the check point system in COD:WWII is either broken or has been set to ""frustrate the player as much as possible""-level as it has a talent for saving just seconds before death. Currently I'm stuck in a Flak gun trying to shoot down many many Stukas. The Flak gun keeps getting destroyed because a Stuka crashes into it. I think, I'm not actually sure, sparks start flying and I can't tell if it's machine gun fire from the planes or what because the sound is so very poor. I've restarted the entire mission to change my luck around, but no, I'm still unable to make it through and I again exploded at more or less the same point as the previous try. I suspect what's going on is intentional which makes it even more frustrating. Now, sitting on a piece of weaponry that's about to explode you'd think I'd jump off it, right? You are right! But you can't, you just have to await your immediate demise and then try it again.  Which becomes maddening and tiresome and annoying very quickly and feels like it’s only meant to draw out the game. So I quit and haven't been back to it since. I'll try again tomorrow and give the multiplayer a go too, that may redeem this game and I'll update this accordingly. [Edit: I didn’t try again, I remember my frustration with the flak gun and went straight to multiplayer. A regrettable decision that resulted in me requesting a refund]There's an issue with the sound on my system (Logitech G35 USB-headset), it'll start crackling after a while and I have to choose another default output and then go back again to the G35s get rid of it. Annoying but at least fixable.There's music and it can't be turned off.  Worse, it's extremely repetitive and very annoying, however it can be turned off in multiplayer.The ""sound"" menu in singleplayer has these options:""volume""""subtitles""""hit feedback volume""That's it. Why do the sound options differ from multiplayer to singleplayer? More on the sound side - the sound just isn't any good. At all, it has no punch, no balls, it's subdued, almost an afterthought hidden benath the mind numbing music. The weapons sound dull, the volume is way too low, enemy fire even close to you is hardly noticable and not penetrating at all. Explosions do sound nice and rumbly when you get lucky. This is POSSIBLY MAYBE connected to the above crackling, that somehow some of my generic stuff doesn't work with this game, I don't know - I hope, because the sound is bad to the level of an embarssing disappointment for an AAA game.  It runs  very well and load times are fine on:i7 4790KGTX 970 @ 2560 x 1440 @ whatever LOD the game decided to give me. 2 x 512 GB SSDsMultiplayer. Found a match, chose some weapon I cound't get rid of, finished match then suddenly I was in some second life place and it was impossible to figure out what to do to get into a new match. Also, you select some sort of unit and there's absolutely nothing to read, you just have to listen to some moron ranting on, which onone of sound mind would do when reading can be done in seconds, I just want to chose my weapon and be on with it.This is crap fest full of fancy blingy ui crap. This is a bad game from my point of view."

												[NO SPOILERS]The Campaign is definitely a challenge on Veteran difficulty, but is cut short with only 12 missions (which 2-3 of the missions are EXTREMELY short) when compared to 2008's COD World At War's 15 amazing missions. The story is about an American squad's experience of the invasion of Nazi Europe from France to Belguim ending obviously in Germany.It also does NOT explore all of the nations that took part in WW2 (Japan, Soviet Union, Italy etc.) and only focuses on Germany, France and US. It's a huge shame they didn't focus on the war globally and are probably leaving Soviets, Japanese etc for DLC...All of that potential missed makes this an extremely disappointing WW2 campaign, but it does have 3-4 good unique missions and sequences throughout that COD hasn't really explored before, not going to spoil, but some parts are pretty amazing. Also some good references and inspiration from WW2 mainstream movies like Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan & the bar pub scene from Inglorious Basterds in one of the missions plus more.Campaign wasn't unforgettabely amazing like MW2's but was not bad or decent either. I really enjoyed some or most parts just a massive shame they left it so limited and rushed. A longer and more detailed WW2 campaign, with a much better ending than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ epilogue we got for this game, would've made this the first good COD SP we've had in a while. I finished this SP in 10 hours on Veteran so I really, really cant recommend this Campaign...Also, just a tip for the Multiplayer, World at War has more weapons in the base game than WWII. If that doesnt tell you how pitiful WWII Multiplayer is I dont know what will..."

I get that you want be diverse, but isn't being historically accurate more important in a world war 2 game? Why, when I leave a lobby, I get put back into that lobby for about 5 times before I find another?Each year infinity ward manages to bring out another game in which the maps and spawns are complete sh*t. Good thing I bought it for pc, saves me the trouble of breaking the CD and putting it in the trash can."

												Call of Duty: WWII amazes me. That's a hard thing to do, because after playing every COD on PC, I've basically seen it all. These games are often plagued with dull ideas, technical problems, poor netcode, imbalanced weapons, and a general ""I don't really care"" attitude from the developers toward the platform. Make no mistake: this game is no different in that regard. What's unique is the way that COD: WWII manages to make the core game unplayable.WWII uses 100% of my 7600K's CPU at nearly all times, except when loading (of all things). Oddly enough, this doesn't directly impact game performance. I still maintain an average of over 100FPS at maximum settings with my GTX 1060. What it does do is cause either Windows 10 or the game itself to not have enough CPU cycles to properly read information from the mouse and keyboard. This results in stuck, delayed, and often lost inputs during both the single player campaign and multiplayer.This can manifest itself in brief millisecond movement stutters, or longer interrupts spanning several seconds where your character will run into gunfire completely out of your control. It's a ridiculous problem to have, and at first I thought my keyboard was broken or that it was being caused by the laggy multiplayer servers. But once I experienced the issue in single player with a different keyboard, it obviously couldn't have been either of those things.No amount of tweaking lowers the CPU usage either, as I tried playing the game in a 640x480 window with everything set to the minimum and the issues persisted[cdn.discordapp.com]. If you force the game to use less CPU power at a system level, it becomes extremely choppy and eventually crashes.The use of max CPU is not a new thing for PC ports in this series, and there are quite a few people who are having that exact problem on better hardware than mine. However, few have mentioned this specific control issue or are conflating it with the game's poor netcode. This has me convinced that it will not be fixed.Perhaps that's for the best, though. Based on what I've played so far, this is my least favorite Call of Duty to date. It's full of regressive mechanics, impenetrable UI, and some pretty severe multiplayer lag. It dashes my hopes that there will ever be a COD that rekindles the enjoyment I experienced from the early Modern Warfare games.And again, most importantly, it barely functions as a video game."

												Campaign is fine, about 4-6 hours, longer if you're like me and can't get used to the vehicle controls which are awful to a massive degrees, tank and plane controls had next to no thought put into them and had to turn down the difficulty to the lowest to get through the tank section. Multiplayer is a mess, fun enough when it works, regular multiplayer is alright, loot boxes are annoying but non-invasive, EXP bonuses is the most game impacting and nothing to worry about imo. Constant disconnects, peer-to-peer connection so your mileage may vary but constantly some degree of rubberbanding or loss of connection to the Activision services, which despite being a peer-to-peer connection can kick several people out of a match arbitrarily, where this really stands out is zombies, there's a rank up system in there which gives you access to class creation tools, neat I thought, unlocked at level 5 which isn't too many rounds, however, if there is any loss of connection (like the afformentioned loss of connection to Activision services which can effect any number of people in the match, and is the most prevalent issue) you lose all progress, I've played a bit more than 4 hours of zombies mode, can get well into it and it will say you've ranked up in game, but once that connection is lost, still stuck at the 3rd rank, can't gain access to any of the customization features. and the constant seemingly random disconnects with no precursors (can see people continuing to move communicate interact with me within less than a second before the disconnect message pops up. hopefully they'll invest at all in stable servers as I was looking forward to coming back and picking this up as a nice pick up and play game from time to time. was alright when I first started, thought it was my own connection issues until myself and friends were all having issues on different connections with no other conections between us lost. Hoping it will get better, not putting any extra money towards this as I'm still having a deal of buyer's remorse"

												Very disappointed.  I felt like I spent more time watching cut-scenes than I did actually playing the campiagn.  By comparison I would say all the early CoD WWII games were far better.  There is no reason this game should be this bad, as we know they can do better.And ditch all the politically correct nonsense, ok?  It's either intended to be historically accurate, good and bad alike, or it is not.UPDATE: Just played the campiagn a second time and my opinion remains the same or worse.  The air mission was a total joke - fighter escorts did not carry bombs and would not be re-tasked to ground support because even if they did they would dump them for a dog fight.  Same with the flak guns - if any GI could shoot down that many planes with a single flak gun there would have been no air left to shoot at.  The same goes for the SOE mission - not remotely realistic nor historically accurate."

												TLDR the game in general is way better then i expected but the tank driving mission is so frustrating i think im about to have a brain aneurysm after trying the mission for about the 25th time the tank driving controlls are that bad. bassed on this mission alone i would not recommend this game.  Details to followOK whoever designed the mission where you get to drive the tank speciffically the part where you need to fight off the tiger and the other panzer and even more speciffically the tank driving controlls needs to be fired. when im trying to reverse and turn the tank half the time  it turns in the opposite direction to what im telling it to.There needs to be an outside view of the tank so you can see where the actual ♥♥♥♥ your going instead of reversing and praying theres nothing bnehind you thats your going to get stuck on and get killed for because as i mentioned previously half the time the tank turns in whatever directon it feels like.Now lets talk turret controll. the turret might as well be in a fixed forward fireing position it turns that god dam slow.and finally THERE ARE WEAK POINTS ON THE FRONT OF A TANK FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKE. like oh i dont know hatches and the lower glacis plate so let me shoot them to do dammage instead of useing the completely non responsive controlls to try and outflank the enemy tanks... or better yet just give me an option to skip this part of the missin completely and let me get back to fighting as an infantry soldier..... please for the love of god leave the vehicle based combat to the battlefield series.... at least they can get the vehicle controlls right.What i have played thru so far i would rate a solid 7/10  remove this abbomination of a tank driving mission and it would be a 9. If or when i some how mannage to get past this part i will add my thoughts on the rest of the game, dont hold your breath waiting tho... i lost count after resuming from the checkpoint after about 25 times."

												I played the Beta, I know what I was getting into (at least thats what I thought). Well where to start, I mostly bought this game because I played the oldschool COD back in the days and I wanted to experience the campaign once again like I remembered it but with a little more polished surface. So far for the good intentions :/ The controls in SP are customizable but please refrain from doing so, otherwise you are stuck with a load of 'unbound' quick time events. Its beyond me how it got behin QA in such a state. Also the controls feel all over the place. I played a lot of CoD in the past, but never have the controls and generals look and feels been sooo terrible annoying. From what I have read the MP is already infested with Cheaters and Botters, and from my pov the campaign isn't worth the money with such terrible controls."

												threw in the towel after two hours of single mission gameplay.. It might look nice in the graphic department but these new games can't seem to match the early MOH, COD sense of gameplay and pace. I find it to be an Arcade shooter on steroids with to much overkill on the actor movie bits and other things that just kill this game completely for me. It's like the designers want to rush you like a madman through the game, couple this with music that can't even be switched off coupled with so many actor's voices screamin' all the time you might start thinking about shooting them early on in the game. Rush to area, shoot a very large number of AI at least more than once unless in the head and get rewarded each time with a helmet or cap that flies straight up in the air. And that is after having to endure the cutscenes with no way of skipping them.. i just find it to much to even be interesting.  And this is only the SP portion of the game, I wouldn't want to try the MP part with all the perks and other bunny hopping crowd it will attract. Thought of giving it a try considering the WWII SP aspect but i would rather recommend the very first WWII COD than this game.Will be looking into returning this game and take comfort that there may be other games in the future that will bring a better WWII game like HELL LET LOOSE.first game i ever asked for a refund."

												I have been playing the Call of Duty games since the beginning in 2003. Because this is the first World War 2 Call of Duty game since World at War and since I am a big fan of World War 2 games in general, I had to buy this one. My opinion on this game.Single Player:The single player game initially brought me back to the good World War 2 Call of Duty days: firing a Panzerschreck, riding with the jeep past enemies, etc. The cutscenes are really nice and the soldiers have some character depth. The team reminded me a little of the characters in the Brothers in Arms series by Ubisoft. But after a while I had the feeling ‘been there, done that’, there is no room for something new.The graphics of the game are in overall inferior to other games like Battlefield 1 which is already a year old now. For example, the game makes use of the same smoke as it was introduced in Call of Duty 2 back in 2005, which was awesome at the time. I found it also strange that the Nazi soldiers were running in it seems to be grey WW1 uniforms, which isn’t historically correct.However, the sound in the game is of superior quality. An M1 Garand never sounded any better.Multiplayer:I have been playing the Battlefield series the last couple of years, and if I have to compare it with this Call of Duty WW2 multiplayer then I must consider this to be ‘a multiplayer for kids’. There is no excitement, it is a quick rush to shoot and kill. On the other hand the zombie multiplayer is funny as always.Finally I must conclude that this CoD WW2 is inferior to its predecessors. I would not recommend it. Instead buy the previous game World at War which was a lot better or Battlefield 1 for a decent mulitplayer."

												Its getting so old...Call of Duty suucks meeeh meh meh COD is for little boys memememe.All this hatred has become a trend ...everybody wants to hate!So I decided to give this game a try. We all wanted the old call of duty back and here we are back in World War 2.After an epic Intro and wonderful looking graphics Ive been thrown into the action in France.Oh boy...I was sooo wrong...Even though the hate (especially on youtube) is crazy...I agree with most other critics.After 5 minutes.... I felt this boring Rollercoaster ride again...there is NO Skill required..no thinking. Its basically just a shooting range and sometimes you have you to walk. The game tells you everything at onceWARNING SPOILER:______________________________Your teammate gets attacked with a knife and is bleeding badly. So as a good comrade you have to save his life by pulling him out of the cluches of war. Finally I thought I get some responsebility. But no...you have to press one button...thats itYou dont pull him out by yourself. It doesnt even matter which button you press...the player moves EVERYTHING automatically ..wohooo exciting...and every 40 seconds you stop and have to shoot upcoming german soldiers. This game is so badly scripted it hurts playing. ______________________________END SPOILERIt feels like the developers think that the players are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.After 1 hour I finished almost the second level..but Im done.. I dissliked this. Its not fun! Nothing cool. Its the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with a world war 2 skin. I had really high hopes this time but again the mediocre gameplay couldnt grab the interest.But hey there is at least the multiplayer right? Yes there is and you know what ? I enjoyed it.At least the first 5 rounds maybe. They definatly put alot of effort into it...but strangely ...it feels like Destiny /Destiny 2. Now you can join the headquarters and you can see your char from 3rd person view. This was nice! Kinda refreshing. You can even go to some sort of arena and do a 1on1 with a stranger and other players can stay outside and watch. There are loads of stuff to collect. But somehow I couldnt appreciate it. This whole Destiny thing feels out of place ...more like a freaking expensive GUI.  The actual gameplay in MP is typical. Nothing really new. Sometimes you see elements like building bridges and stuff to charge towards the enemy but the game ""Day of Infamy"" does it a thousend times better..The hardcore mode was the mode I enjoyed the most (regular modes you need to shoot a whole magazin into the enemy so they at least get a good amount of dmg).In my opinion the this is the ONLY mode where people still play it like a call of duty(mostly no camping). But the fun doesnt stay for long..For me the feeling of ""Ive seen this already"" is just too strong here. I am not mad I bought this. It was a proof : Call of Duty is dead. No matter which scenario.But of course I hope that there are still people who can enjoy this type of game. No hatin from me dawg.PS: The multiplayer is NOT overrun by kids. Most people Ive spoken too were adults like it should be....but it didnt stop them from behaving like children."

The fact that you cant drive your tank in any direction other than where your gun is pointed removes any sort of tactical gameplay from the equation.This mission has left me wondering why I bought the game."

												Pretty alright game, not the strongest computer but i can still run it on high after updating my driver. Though other people aren't so lucky. Zombies is amazing, definitely added some new stuff and feels good to play. Multiplayer is riddled with cheaters. Game has been out for a day and aimbotters are already running around freely. Seriously, how is this an issue already with a AAA title game.Edit: Hackers are still flourishing in this game. Tried reporting one with my friend and it crashed both our games. Absolutely hilarious"

												The game (multiplayer) is full of bugs and is far from optimized. The gameplay itself is fun and Carentan brings back memories from golden age of CoDs. Buy it if they fix extremely slow loading into game, between rounds and even after the game (why can't I leave the game without waiting 30sec after each match not being able to even open a menu?). Headquarters is unnecessary and extremely buggy in itself."

												If you only play for Campaign mode, and you're willing to spend $60 for 2/3 of the game being completely broken, then I recommend this. The Campaign story mode is actually quite good, though much different from the traditional COD campaigns. It feels more like it could be an actual war vet's story (historical inaccuracies aside). Unfortunately, it is quite short with only 12 missions which I was able to complete in a day. This game doesn't like to honor it's own V-sync settings, 80% of the time, and it has horrible stuttering without V-sync. Almost so bad that it can make you sick from looking at it. Unless you have a Freesync or Nvidia G-Sync capable monitor with gpu combo, be very prepared for horrible stuttering. Do you use multiple displays? Prepare for multiple crashes and a massive headache trying to get THAT to work, as the game crashes every time you try to change or add displays, throwing a Directx error at you. Other than that, this game looks very pretty (or gory) and is pretty well optimized. you can expect pretty good framerates from a low to mid end GPU. eg: GTX 1050ti, GTX 1060Multiplayer? The game crashes 80% of the time i try to load a map in local and online multiplayer and zombies. If you can handle that, and you're just fine and dandy with playing only by yourself or with others in local sessions, then sure. Online with other players? Well, let's just pretend you're even capable of connecting online. Cheaters. There are cheaters with aimbots and wallhacks everywhere. There isn't very much class customization, no multiple perks, just the 1 basic training ""perk"" that you apply, killstreaks are kinda cool, the maps are very uninspired, typical 3 pathway style maps that all feel the same. HQ is kind of a neat idea, adding a social element to the game and some other things like a shooting range and prestige area, but ultimately just slows down actions that could otherwise be accomplished in a GUI menu.But you wont be able to connect online because error code 5 [the only fix for this is to have a friend with their copy working online to give you a copy of their four .dcache files located in ""\steamapps\common\Call of Duty WWII\main"" and replace yours with theirs. But you'll likely have to do this with every hotpatch that is released)Zombies? Well... the game likes to try and jumpscare you all the time with zombies popping up right where you're about to look. usually they'll pop up right where you were looking, but look away for a split second, and BOO! there it is. With a loud soundbyte and the character reacting to these ""jumpscares"" to boot. It's kinda neat, but ultimately makes it very difficult to ""train"" zombies. So you're constantly weaving through zombies instead of ever feeling like you're in a safe zone. because one could just spawn behind you or right where you're about to look, even when it seems like BS. Even between rounds, there's no down time with zombies, they still spawn between rounds. Whether you like that or not is up to personal preference I suppose...Zombies online? be prepared for disconnects and crashes.The game feels significantly lacking in overall content... though, that could just be the feeling of lacking quality...If you liked earlier COD titles like World at War, Black Ops, Black Ops 2, and the Modern Warfares, but didn't like the newer COD titles like Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare, then you probably won't like Call of Duty WWII. I know everyone treats Ghosts as a joke, but it's better than WWII if that says anything about this game... It feels incomplete, unfinished, unpolished.If you play to only download single player, or only download multiplayer, you'll likely run into an issue that prevents the game from launching because it's missing assets from the other version. So there's no point in having split .exe other than annoying the end user. about 90GB total filesize, so if you have slow download speed like me, be prepared for multiple nights of downloading.And remember, you probably won't be able to play online because Error Code 5. (Activision hasn't even addressed this)I regret 100% purchasing this game. I've tried to refund multiple times, due to how broken it is, but never get a human person to see my refund request message. most of my playtime is just dealing with crashes, relaunching the game into menus and trying to get the game to work properly. I've downloaded the game on 2 machines, Windows 7 GTX 1070, 16GB DDR4, I7 7700K on a 7200RPM HDD, and Windows 10 GTX 1060, 16GB DDR4, I7 7700HQ, 5400RPM HDD (Lenovo Legion Y720 gaming laptop) and all the same issues occur on both machines.Stay far away from Call of Duty: WWII. If you crave for a good World War 2 multiplayer experience, check out Day of Infamy. It's very well done, and made with Source engine. If you crave a good online shooter experience but don't care about World War 2 theme, Counter Strike: Global Offensive is always a good choice. Or any of the earlier COD games. Anything before Ghosts is a good COD game."

												The game would be fun but they ♥♥♥♥ed a few game breaking things up.1. You should let people filter servers and let the community create their own dedicated server so i don't constantly play with red ping.2. Leave the SJW garbage out if you said this is about realism , i mean really black woman/men in the war? Little to few swastica's due to cencorship? Fire those SJW suggesters as they just ruined the cod franchise once again.3. Remove the ♥♥♥♥ing pride/gay/rainbow flag♥♥♥♥♥♥in multiplayer why tf is this in a war game? 4. Why is there not ranked on release and why are you only implementing it on 1 December?? The game released today wich is 3 November , not 1 December it's suppost to be a finished product.5. I know it's cosmetic micro transactions but i want the old ways of cod 4 modern warfare 1 back where you could work for your skins and stuff. The game industry needs a turn around and move away from this money hungry sh()t. 60$ games don't need ANY micro transactions.EDIT: It says I have 6 mins of gameplay , while I have over 10 hours on multiplayer and zombies , When i entered the singleplayer i was already greeted with a false image of ww2 so i never felt the need to go further. The mutliplayer and zombies hours do not add to this game (only the ww2 sp ) . Make sure to make rate this review helpfull for the SJW to get more triggered."

												i think the WW2 series has been officially lost the only reason i did actually buy this game hoping for some nostalgia trip from the WAW lane but all I got was SJW garbage sledgehammer and Activion is constantly shoving down the community throat were you'd have Gay, Tran , Asexual pride flags in it. I just want to play a simple shooter game and have fun and not have the game throwing liberal trash at me and also the game is still heavy in cencoreship even in the US version of the game as you only see a couple of swatika flag and thats most as there are still a lot of flag with the iron cross and even the swatika armband has been replace with an iron cross in campaignedit: i don't find the game really that bad but the reason i disliked it is that i don't like SJW inject their garbage into games"

												Well the ""back to our roots"" CoD is just the same game with a WW2 overlay. The twitchiness and jetpack madness gets slowed too much in the opposite direction. Slow and clunky feeling, and just generally not fun comparing to the likes of Battlefield. Pros:-Runs fine.Cons: -Corner camping simulator. Sprinting equals death, as players just camp corners and hear footsteps and prefire.-Maps suck, especially Gibraltar. -Weapons ready too slow, and the feel of the game is slow as well, down to the soldier movements.-Just not fun"

												****This is a breif focus on the singleplayer****Dont get me going on the multiplayer! But a quick google should bring up some un ethical behaviour and controversy.I was really hoping they would have kept their promise on an historically accurate campaign, now i knew it would never be as realistic/historically correct as the gunplay you might find in red orchestra, or have the simulator battle experience arma games might provide as this game is trying to appeal to the widest demographic. But you still made a promise Sledgehammer Games.  However there are so many flaws its to hard to pick them all out. Just to name and shame a few however we can include the MG42 bafflingly stupid low rate of fire it might as well have been a musket, or how about the five rounds of a kar 98k sniper on a stripper clip being loaded into the gun with the scope attached which would be physically impossible or the shotgun with the range of one of those lego sets with the push lauchers you would find on a star wars kit, heck I think even those launch further.   I think this series is tired and wasting away and i dont think WW2 as a genre is the issue here. Because if it was we would'nt have the success we see with games such as 'day of infamy', Its just call of duty has become so predictable and formulaic which has led to the gameplay feeling regurgitated from previous games with just a new lick of paint to cover its old design. The obligatory turret section, The on rails jeep ride with some driving, thats new? Right guys? Sniper segments? Check. Lets not also forget our dear friend as well, the QTE.Maybe im getting older? Maybe im just bitter and cynical and will need a zimmer frame and a good cup of tea but I honestly could not complete the campaign so perhaps I missed something later in the game which was incredible and groundbreaking. (I doubt) (For those interested I got up to the church defense section where the tower had just collapsed.)This is the first cod I have ever not completed maybe because all I could hear was ""historical accuracy"" over again in my head as I shot down more stuka dive bombers in 5 minutes than the entire RAF had in the whole year of 1940 alone, Oh by the way they didnt crash either they blew up in the air like pigeons who had eaten to much alka-seltzer. my review is not as in depth due not completing the game, heck can I even review it, well I have. But for anyone who has any basic idea of ww2 weaponary, uniforms, tanks and aircraft (ive probably missed a lot too) might be tempted to stop playing if they had been promised historical accuracy."

												I sit here and write this view while the game is currently bugged after todays patch 1/23/2018. So not surprised that thousands cant launch this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game immediately after an update, well done SHG. Ill try and summarize my review in bullet points to spare you, and I am in the upper tier of PC players for this game. -WORST COD EVER and this game is just caterded to people who suck-Sprint out time hardly exists-9 pathetic maps-None of the maps have any flow to them-Random spawns-You can get shot from nearly any angle , anytime-I constantly get in lobbys with people from Australia, and Im East Coast USA-Takes EIGHT seconds for health regen, meaning good players cant get rewarded-CANT USE A ♥♥♥♥ING SUPPRESSOR WITH MOUNTAIN CLASS-With all the headglitches the game is catered towards NOT MOVING-Therefore all the ppl who play slow just sit with shotguns and you cant win that fight close quarters-Quickscoping requires zero skill even after the so called ""nerf""-Weapon balance is a joke theres legit 3-4 guns used in the whole game-Scorestreaks are pathetic, not creative and not fun, and definitlely not rewarding-Headquarters is a glorified please take my money center-In game social system and tabs are♥♥♥♥♥♥br>-Footsteps are too much.. again making it easier for people not to move and you just come into their crosshairs making Airborne class useless-The second you shoot 1 bullet the entire enemy team knows where you are, and with 8 second health regen you are basically ♥♥♥♥ed.. again making people not want to move as much-PC Still has a TON of cheaters that WE have to send in footage of to SHG, they DONT DO♥♥♥♥♥♥br>-Play of the game killcam is pointless -Depending on latency there is usually a half second to full second delay between your screen and persons screen your shooting at-They gave us 9 starting maps and want us to PAY money for additional maps? The maps are boring, poor design with no flow,♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics-All the stats and leaderboards are bugged-There are many more things Im just going off the top of my head but within 30 minutes this game is just boring as ♥♥♥♥..like when have you ever said that about a CoD game? Seriously, 90% of people who buy this game quit after the first day, SAVE your 60$-Watch YouTube videos, NO ONE is making CoD WW2 videos OR streaming it for a reason, the game is HORRIBLE-Activisions CEO was recently fired and Michael Condrey is just a joke stealing our money.

												I bought this game because my PC gaming buddy that i normally play shooters with told me ""this is the best CoD in a long time"" ... I mean, maybe it is... But i've been playing Battlefield 1 (stay with me, im going somewhere with this) for a while and i got used to it and its level of quality.To be frank, CoD:WWII's quality level is nowhere near that of BF1. I find it unbearable.The singleplayer campaign is... well its ok. Its not great, but its ok. To be honest it feels like its from one of the old CoDs. Theres just not enough ambiance. The gun sounds reminds of of Medal of Honor Allied Assault. You get into a firefight, then as soon as every ennemy is dead theres just no sound at all. The guns have no reverb. It feels like im shooting an airsoft gun. Hell, i handled airsoft guns that were louder than the guns in this game.Other points have already been said by other reviews. Characters and the narrative dont draw me in or keep me interested.The best moment in the campaign are the big Hollywood destruction scenes you'd expect from CoD. Its cool, but its really too hollywood for my taste. Some missions offer a change of pace to the usal run-and-gun. You get to sneak around and even infiltrate a garrison disguised as a german liaison officer. You have to keep up to date with your cover story to not get discovered at checkpoints and the like. Its a nice change of pace. The sneaking is meh, alot of other games have done it better. Also you get to shoot german shepards.The multiplayer is.. well its pretty much what you'd expect.Its fast paced. Yeah. It feels horrible getting killed over and over again by bunny hoppers and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tactics that are widely used in the game. Its just.. bad. No enjoyable at all. You have a headquarter where you get to walk around and get missions and unlock stuff and interact with other players and such. Its ok, exept when theres a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s yelling profanities at each other over voicechat. Y'know, typical CoD community.The match themselves arent very enjoyable either. I mean seriously? 6 v 6? in 2017? Absurd.They tried making a more objective-driven mode with ""war mode"".. But again, its ruined by the playerbase and their ridicuous tactics (if you can call them that). 4 out of 5 matches i play are completely unbalanced because one team is filled with typical CoD players with their typical crappy cod gameplay. And the fact that its still 6 v 6 and on a small maps just make it look completely pathetic compared to BF1.Overall, its a very below average game. Not worth the price unless you're a die-hard CoD fan. If you're a CoD fan, you'll be fine since its your typical CoD gameplay... But if you like shooters in general (CoD, BF and any other shooters out there), and especially if you like more simulating and tactical shooters (like Arma, Squad, Insurgency etc.), then this game isnt worth your money. Stay far from it."

												Straight up one of the worst CoD campaigns I've played. Note: Played on veteran difficultyPros:-Easy shooting mechanics like a typical CoD-Gameplay is smooth, again like the other CoDs-Interesting new hp/ammo/etc. system from AI teammatesCons:-Story is very generic, not very absorbing. Honestly didn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about any of the characters because they either aren't very likable or I just didn't get to know them enough. Compared to another game I recently played, Wolfenstein 2, it's night and day. This game didn't get me to care at all. I was just shooting through to the end. -Historical accuracy is nowhere to be found. Examples listed at the bottom.-Feels like I'm fighting Chris Kyle clones who are killing me almost instantly regardless of range or concealment. Made worse by their camo, making it very hard to shoot back even if I managed to spot them.(The damage makes sense for the difficulty, but their accuracy and ability to see me through bushes/smokes doesn't)-Enemies, including dogs, completely ignore my teammates and gun straight for me-Teammates are terrible at killing enemies, sometimes letting enemy soldiers run through my entire squad to kill me. Other times they just refuse to shoot the enemy 1 meter in front of them while I'm reloading.-Stealth is very basic, solely based on proximity.-Guns take forever to actually kill things in veteran, feels like I'm fighting super soldiers who can take 3 headshots from guns like the STG44. Maybe they are secretly Iron Men?-Plane and tank controls are AWFUL, sensitivity and control scheme wise.-Got stuck in instant death loops(respawn at a checkpoint and already have multiple enemies shooting at me, probably only happens in higher difficulties due to damage and I had to restart from an earlier point or the entire mission)-bugs and glitches, got stuck between a mortar and a crate -_---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some historical inaccuracies on the top of my head while playing through, may or may not be in the mission order:1. More than half of the American Shermans in the first two missions(on D-Day and during D-Day breakout) had 76mm guns. Well, the first ones didn't arrive in Europe for service until July. Even in the second mission, just because they started to arrive it doesn't mean tank units will instantly have a lot of them. So it's crazy there are so many 76mm shermans around in the first two missions.2. Germans using Soviet weapons on D-Day????3. My teammates call out Waffen-SS, I poke out to see volkssturm uniformed soldiers using outdated guns. I'm sorry, but the SS units responding to D-Day weren't volkssturm or ost units.4. When you commanded the Sherman with the 75mm gun, the game tells you that you cannot penetrate the enemy tank in front of you. *Looks at enemy tank* ""Hey it's a Panzer IV Ausf. G! I can't pen this?"" Long story short, the Sherman with the short 75mm(M3) Gun has 88mm of penetration at 100 meters. The Panzer IV you face has at most 80mm of armor on the front hull and 50mm on the turret front. Can someone tell me why 88<80/50? But I can penetrate the side of a Tiger II, which also has 80mm of armor angled at 90 degrees. O.o5. 1st Infantry Division privates being issued M1 Carbines?? Huh?6. Half of the Germans used Russian weapons. :/7. So many Panzerschrecks but never saw any Germans use the Panzerfaust, which was far more common. I even saw boxes lying around, but nobody seems to be using them.8. The M1919 fires so slowly, almost sounds like a 20mm cannon9. MG42 fires so slowly, Hitler's Buzzsaw? I think not.10. The 20mm AA shells are a bit crazy in terms of...well everything...if they were that good in ww2 the Germans wouldn't have any problems with allied CAS."

												As a fan of COD and most any WW@ game , this was possibly my most antisipated game of 2017 . Pre-Ordered , waited , dreamed about it , ect . Finally !!! Played the single player Campain , My first thought , WTF???? Your force to scramble through each time sensitive mission . And thats after waiting what seems an eternity for the drama filled videos for each mission . God forbid you go back to play afterwards and can not hit enter to bypass the lenghty videos . Multiplayer was even more of a disapointment to say the least . I got in to the game when it first came out many years ago , massive multiplayer maps , massive amount of servers and players , incredable scenery and gameplay . Peploe creating some of the best and largest maps ever. This new game SUCKS!!!!!!!!! 6-12 players jumping and dancing around like an arcade game , tiny maps , no chosing weapons , teams , servers , ect . What a waste of $50 . If your considering it , wait a while for the prise to come down , say in a year or so when it hits $10.00 . Biggest hype of the year and biggets let down of the year !!!!!! Shame on you Actvision and Sledgehammer ...."

												Fun game at first but lack of content to keep me coming back. This is the first Call of Duty i've purchased since Modern Warfare 2 and overall its not bad. Campaign is cinematic and entertaining, kinda feels like they were going for a Band of Brothers style story but didnt quite hit the mark. Suffers from some historical inaccurasies/political correctness issues. Around 7 hours long. Multiplayer maps are small and not enough of them, also its really annoying that 2 of the 8 maps were places never fought during the war ( London docks and USS Texas).  The matches are dominated by smgs and sniper rifles for the most part and on that note sniper rifles are way too easy to use and are a 1 shot kill. if you enjoy fast paced gameplay and have quick reaction you will probably like it for a while. Feels like COD. Just not near enough gun or map variety to keep it interesting for long.. The game in general  looks really good and is optimized well as you would expect for a $60 title. Solid Campaign, and Nazi Zombies is a fun distraction with friends but the multiplayer just isnt as good as i had hoped it would be. For that reason, i dont think it is quite worth the money and i'd recommend waiting to buy it on sale."

												I really REALLY tried to be patient with this game, do not buy it for $60. If you are thinking of getting it wait until it's at least half off. In fact it might be better to just pirate it somewhere. Actually don't do that, the game isn't even worth pirating. I've gotten past the first two missions in campaign and a laggy zombies map with Europeans. In two hours i've had to redownload the game twice, lost my save three times in a row and am wrought with performance issues. I can go from 144 fps to 30 and back up. Constant stutter all the time, and endless crashing over and over again. This game feels unpolished and unfinished.

												First legitimate review ever posted:Purchased: 23.02.17.Play Time: 3 hours 26 minutes.System Specs: i7 7700K, GTX 1070, 16GB Ram.POSITIVES:- None.NEGATIVES:- Poor system optimisation for my system. I was hampered by constant slow downs where the game would just crawl to a stop and i would have to wait 1-2 seconds for it to become responsive again.- This is a ""best hits"" of WW2. Imagine getting on a tour bus and being driven around, stopping at each iconic location and then the tour guide saying "" OKAY, SHOOT SOME PEOPLE OVER THERE. WHEN YOURE DONE I WILL TAKE YOU TO THE NEXT LOCATION"" and you have another eight painful hours to continue on the tour. - Multiplayer on COD on PC is beyond a joke. I didn't try Multiplayer so my experience is Campaign only.- For being very ""squad"" based, there is no COOP gameplay ala World at War (which was a good game).- The controls and responsiveness when driving any vehicle, and in particular the tanks was game breaking. I wanted to smash my keyboard it was that bad. There is no reason it should be that terrible when COD could have learnt from the Battlefield series.- How Nazi's are portrayed in this game is terrible. If you've ever played Wolfenstein, this game is going to feel baby mode to you. Nothing you do in the story feels like it affects anything. Your squad's relationships between each other and yourself are forced and not rewarding at all.- I can't believe that in 2017 in a AAA title, you can look down and see yourself floating still. Immersion breaks immediately.- I've made the mistake of purchasing the last couple of COD titles because i like playing campaign modes where I'm constantly trying to relive the glory of Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1. You're not going to be happy playing this title.TL;DR- Review based on Campaign mode only. Multiplayer on PC has been and will always be catered for the console community and will remain terrible and unrewarding on PC.- This game is terrible.  Do not waste your money.- If you do want to try, remember STEAM will automatically allow you to refund your purchase if you play less than 2 hours, or on a ""case by case"" scenario. - If you want a good multiplayer game, play Battlefield 4. - If you want good Campaigns, then play Battlefield One. - If you want a good Nazi shooter game, with great writing and good gameplay, play Wolfenstein.Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Emblem and gun skin creator aren't released at the time of me writing this and there is no indication of when they are coming out. That seems like a simple task for such a big company to put into their game if they already have stations for it that you can't use set up in the headquarters.

												In the current state it's in, this is a HUGE waste of money. There are plenty of bugs. Some players can't even start the game without it crashing, some people have issues like 100% cpu usage on their $500+ cpu. Most I5 users also seem to have the same issue that nearly every PC cod launch has had. 100% usage or just runs like absolute crap. This problem is usually fixed 2-3 months after release. Why the same problem arises every year? who knows.I had my PC built last year for $2000AU. Can only run this on very low, everything possible off, 75% res.  Yet i can play a game like the Witcher 3, 1440p, Ultra, 60fps? There are 100 more problems i could list. They released this with NO anti-cheat. All we have is VAC atm. Which hasn't done much since release. I still get in games with hackers i met a few days after release, still blatant hacking, still getting reported by the whole lobby. You cannot play a fair game. There is always atleast 1 hacker every 2-3 games. Sometimes it's worse. Rarely it's better. It only took a few days after release for hackers to start showing up. Now it's filled with them. Some are blatant, some try to hide it. After calling some out they toggle off, some toggle on near the end of the game to win. I've seen hackers that were once blatant, now just using wallhacks with slight aim assist to try hide themselves. They give themselves away by pre-aiming player positions and/or soft aim locking players. I barely play anymore, every game is just ""ok another hacker"", ""report, report steam acc, warn everyone, leave"". You try search for another game, either get put back in the last game, put with another hacker or very rarely a fair game. You try search for a different mode and the same thing, 70/30 chance of a hackers lobby or fair game. Yes you do get fair games with legit players but honestly you get games with hackers more often. What a waste of 120$ AU i spent on this garbage. It was a little fun at release but is slowly being killed by no game breaking bug fixes, no anti-cheat and no word from the devs on anything. They have said nothing about hackers AT ALL.Please save your money, $60-100 can be spent on much better things. $60+ for a game that might not even open on your system. $60+ for something that could run at 100% usage causing fps drops, stutters and what not. $60 to play with game ruining hackers every second game. Go buy your wife/girlfriend something nice. Buy a much better game. ANYTHING is worth buying over this broken mess. I'd rather buy a rusty spoon for $120. Atleast it's capable of something."

												Laughably bad. The screenshots and videos make the game look like a movie, while ingame it plays out much, much more differently. Aside from the obvious laughable black men and women Nazis, even the campaign is historically inaccurate with Germans wielding PPSH's (a Russian SMG) in the far Western Front. Really?The multiplayer is filled with your stereotypical 12 year old campers and the zombies isn't even worth it. It's unique and different with 'Jolts' being used as a currency rather than Points, but still...what the ♥♥♥♥.Also, the campaign is...weird. The movement is very stiff, and kind of buggy. Cutscenes are forced and your character is jolted and yanked to and from to place him where he needs to be. Sometimes text overlaps with text (not a resolution issue) and some things are unclear. Stay. Clear. Gross."

												Since a long time I've dared to buy a CoD again and thought 'Please don't let me regret this' since I was very much looking forward to a CoD in a WW2 setting. Guess what, I deeply regret it. I'm not complaining about the servers, instead I'm complaining about how I can't even play this game (multiplayer) from a technical side. In 9/10 cases I won't get past the loading screen of a match. Game is loading and right when I should jump straight into a match, the game closes with no real error message (CoD has stopped working and I can only close it). When I finally get into one match (after 9 fails), I can play smoothly but right after the match, when the statistics should be displayed etc., it crashes again and I have to try 9 times again until I get into a match.I've tried to elimante all possible mistakes from my side but after a few hours I noticed, this error is not coming from my side. Important to say is, that exactly this was already happening in the beta and they didn't manage to fix this until release and that's just horribly sad.Here's what I tried:- Installed newest drivers (of everything)- Checked that I have Windows 10 on the newest version- Installed the newest Microsoft Visual C++- Deactivated Antivirus program (completely)- Uninstalled GeForce Experience- Shut down all applications running in the background- Lowered graphics in every possible way (although I'm having a very strong rig)- Tried reparing the game through Steam- Tried compatibility mode from Windows- Tried running the game as administrator(- Don't have MSI Afterburner or something similiar installed)(- Windows 10 already has Internet Explorer 11 installed like it was recommended in some forums)(- Trying to re-installing the game won't help since it didn't in beta and it won't now)I ran out of ideas now and I'm really done with this game. They didn't manage to roll out a fix for this since beta and I'm now refunding it. This was the freaking last time I bought a CoD. GG Sledgehammer / Activision... NOT."

												(It says 5 mins played, I had to install and open the singleplayer in order to publish this review. This is mainly an multiplayer review, I have not touched the campaign) I've been a huge fan of Call of Duty for the longest, but I cannot recommend WWII. The game that was supposed to “bring CoD back”. My reasons being:- Low population (or bad matchmaking)Every match seems like a sweat fest, I'd say I'm over average in shooters and CoD is a game I've played for many years so I know the mechanics. The thing is that I can't just relax and ""wreck"", every match seems like the final in ESL or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ This might be a plus for some, but this is in normal matchmaking no kind of ""ranked"". This can be because the population on PC is so small that there is a lot of players loyal to the series therefore a lot better than average, or there is some kind of skill based matchmaking in public matches.- Cheaters.I run into cheaters everyday, and playing hardcore is basically impossible without meeting a cheater every game. Sledgehammer was boasting about supporting the PC community and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that, but there are just slightly modified cheats from Advanced Warfare (their last CoD) that is being used in this game. It's ridiculous. I've played 467 hours of Black Ops 3 the past two years before WWII came out, and I have not met a single cheater. There were cheaters in the BETA of WWII, but Sledgehammer said that was because ""the anticheat wasn't on so people couldn't have cheats ready for launch day"". Explain the situation now, will you?- Domination 50 and TDM 75They had DOM50 (50 points per kill instead of 100 so it takes a lot longer to get scorestreaks and makes the gamemode pretty boring in my and many others’ opinion) and TDM75 (TDM with 75 kills and not 100) in the first console beta, but changed it for console beta number 2 because of feedback. They had DOM100 and TDM100, everyone was happy until the game came out and they gave us the version of the game that was beta number 1. Michael Condrey (game director at Sledgehammer) has also blatantly been lying on Twitter saying that the community PREFERS DOM50, when that obviously is not right based on the feedback after that.- XP gain is way to slowThe thing that is fun with Call of Duty is constantly getting rewards and leveling up. That has become extremely clear to me that that's the reason CoD has been so addicting with WWII. The XP rate is very slow compared to other CoDs, to the point that ""double XP"" feels normal. They have also been lying about this with the community saying that the first weeks of the game they accidently turned one double XP and tuned it back. I'm convinced that the reason they have nerfed the XP gain is because the game gives you XP boosts in Supply Drops. The dreaded micro transactions that have been ♥♥♥♥ing up CoD since Advanced Warfare.For us PC players I think it's time to just accept that CoD on PC is dead (if you're not into Treyarch zombies). I'll be waiting on Battalion 1944 instead, a real old school CoD2/CoD4 Promod esc shooter made for PC.EDIT: Looks like Sledgehammer have been lying about the skill based matchmaking according to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/WWII/comments/7hoavz/driftor_just_got_my_first_sbmm_challenge/ will update further.EDIT 2: The game also still now in December have updates like Ranked Play (season 1 started 1st of December on console) and the emblem editor that have been on a console for a while now."

												First off, not bothered at all about the gender and race 'issues' in this game. If that is what you're upset about, if that is what you find 'unrealistic' in game where you can bunnyhop around while shooting people with a sniper rifle from ten yards away you have other issues. This game isn't about realism, never was, and I find it infinitely amusing that the people who love labeling everyone else as 'snowflakes' are themselves triggered by something as trivial as this.So, why am I giving this game a thumbs down? It's too twitchy for me. It has the veneer of WWII, but beneath it all it's nothing but an arena shooter. Which, if that's what you want, is fine, but I prefer a bit more thinking in my shooters. Maps are too small, teams are too small, action is too frantic with no plan needed beyond having the faster trigger finger."

												This is a 'Triple A' title in 2017 and it has 2D pixelated fire graphics. I mean seriously what. I know this game is ment to have the feel of a 'boots on the ground' COD like World At War but its not ment to look like it aswell. Just take your time to look at any surface and you'll see how bad some of the textures are. Followed by like 8 maps that all look the same (Bland and grey) and follow the same formula of 3 boring lanes. The only map that currenlty stands out is the snow map with the big train in the middle and thats only cause that map is complete train wreak. 3 War maps which is by far the better game mode but is still way outshined by Battlefield 1 storymode based mutiplayer modes. Not played the single player but the only mode currently that stands out is the Zombies which is well done but after you've done both like story lines there is 0 reason to replay it.Edit: 19 hours played in Mutiplayer but it only lets you review it if you play the single player."

												I can't get through the stupid tank missions because it handles like it has down syndrome. And once again someone getting shot in the leg or arm can just shake it off after a second and be back to 100% combat effectiveness (Just like in real life!). This culture of over-hyping and under-delivering is killing these games. I feel like I have been cheated! Has anybody at Activision ever shot an M1? I have one and believe me, you can't fire off 8 rounds in 3 seconds with minimal muzzle movement. Do your frickin' ""boots on the ground"" research you developer hacks!"

												I have 70 multiplayer hours, most of which I enjoyed. However, I can't recommend it. Worst spawns in cod history, dull/boring/trappy maps (looking at you Gibraltar), terrible team balancing. No game is close, one team always blows the other out and usually ends up trapping them in a minute or so. Hope you get lucky and get thrown onto that team. My first cod game I played on PC, are there usually this many hackers? Can't tell you how many people I've reported already for blatant hacks. Do they ever do anything about it? But I will say in hardcore; teams usually do a good job at teamkilling the hacker until they leave (good on you community). Toxic as hell as expected otherwise. Performance wise, runs the spectrum from excellent to terrible in seconds. I get huge FPS drops when I get near enemy players, and it's not network lag. Also entering certain areas causes temporary stuttering and drops. War especially causes the most problems and I'm running a pretty nice rig. Only noticed after one of the early patches. Not all bad, they have some cool concepts: War is a nice addition, insurgency-like mode which adds new dimensions to cod. Zombies is done well and I like the direction they went adding a *questline*. HQ I find a waste of time. Yeah it's different but I don't find myself using it unless I HAVE to and I don't enjoy it. Extra load times, people constantly preaching bible scripture??? but you can mute. Only use it for challenges and rewards, just a feature they could have buried and put time into other things."

												I was really looking forward to this game as it covers an era I'm fascinated by. It was bought for me as a present al held off until just before Christmas to play it. Not a problem for my Core i7 8 core 3.2Ghz, 12gb RAM, Nvidia GTX 970 4gb VDRAM right?Wrong. Game crashes during the initial intro. I must of run it 10 times and once got to the landing craft about to run out... and crash again. It's usually create 2D texture error reporting not enough memory, but sometimes it just freezes and requires a hard reset of the PC. Graphics drivers all up to date, no hardware faults and no problems with any other games I own. So I set about googling how to make it work. Most suggestions boil down to reducing the detail pretty much everywhere. So after 2 hours of tweaking, freezes, restarts & frustration...great scott! I managed to finally run up the beach and play it. My enthusiasm faded somewhat as the game still crashes randomly, but I perservered and got to the 3rd mission in the single player campaign. Next day, being vaugly confident I tried the multiplayer... crashed immediatly black screen. I then rebooted and tried to resume my single player campaign only to see my checkpoints all gone and all I could do was start the game from scratch. I'd love to get to the level where you guys are moaning about the cheats on multiplayer, or frustraingly bad gameplay. Just not got past first base on my otherwise relaible gaming rig, and glad to be rid of this title assuming I can get a refund..."

												It's good in my opinion.Multiplayer feels like it has a lot more to do now with new daily and weekly orders to do, awarding you with xp, credits and supply drops, collections to fill out by opening said supply drops and a lot of things to level up and prestiege (your soldier, guns and divisions).Wait did I say supply drops? Yes, this game features them heavily, but before you grab your pitchforks, they are very generous with giving them out. I must have opened about 20 so far and I didn't spend any extra money on them. They also aren't too gamebreaking, you'll mostly want to open them for the collections as I mentioned earlier, but they'll also drop you some double xp in-game time (which gets used automatically, so no hoarding 1000 hours of dxp).In terms of gameplay, it's COD, if you liked WaW and Black Ops 1 you'd like this. They got rid of the pick 10 system, so no longer do you feel like you need to give up your grenades just so you can get an extra perk. Speaking of perk, those are replaced with divisions and basic training. You pick one of each of those two, no more, no less. there are 5 divisions that you can level up 4 times each, getting new perks, then prestige them if you wish to unlock more items. Then there are roughly 28 basic training(s?) that give you a small boost, such as being able to reload faster and while sprinting, flinching less when shot or not letting enemies see skulls for your kills. Which coming from CS:GO, I appreciate since it make the playing field a bit more even, never did I feel like I missed out on a kill because I didn't have a specific division or basic training.Zombies is a huge meh, I've only played 2 games so far, both solo, and without looking at gameplay beforehand and I already managed to make it to the final boss (died because I thought it was stunned when it wasn't). You're given a small journal in game and it tells you what step you're on, what you need to do and even outlines (through walls) what you need to interact with. I only need to search online for 1 step, the rest of it was easy. You also don't lose your perks when you go down. So if you're looking for the challenge that Black Ops 1, 2 and 3 zombies gave you with their tedious and very secret steps, this is a huge downgrade for you. I've only played the first mission of the campaign and it's okay, but nothing I haven't seen before. Health doesn't regenerate and you can ask your squadmates for ammo and medkits, but that's about the only difference I could notice so far.TL;DRI like it"

												Regardless of whether the game is good or bad.There is a major problem with cheaters/hackers on multiplayer and the developers do not care. Lets be honest, there are cheaters in every FPS games, and we have all seen them. What makes this unbearable in this game is that, nothing is being done and no way to take the situation in to our own hands like vote kick and black list a player. Due to the lack of these features, you will be matched against a cheater every 3-4 games, who are so open and blatant about their aimbot that they do not care to hide it at all..Lastly, you can buy it if you are curious. But make sure to play multiplayer first and get a refund with under 2 hours of game play. Or else you have just funded a incompetent studio for nothing.If your still sitting on the fence about whether to buy the game or not.

												First of all .  For all those who are gonna reply negative on my review, this is my personal perspective.  This is how I experience the game from my site.First of all let me give you some info on my system and internet connection before ppl start to talk about upgrading my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rig or my internetconnection:250 mbs donwloand, 100 mbs uploadI7 6700K oced at 4.8ghz32gb DDR 4 ram running at 3000Asus Strix 1080  O8G running at 2200 MhzAll this is cooled by a custom loop with two rads1) Single player:  Not much different from other versions.  Again it is a story told in a cinematic environment.  Am I surpisded: NO, Am I convinced about the story: NOThere are fun moments in the single player, but hey i find this campaign too linair.  Lots of dumb things in the story.  FIrst of all.  The invasion of Normandy, this should be played out better.  This was one of the biggest happenings during WW2.  But in this story you already are in the bunker after one minute of play.  This should have been much more spectacular.  Saving one of your fellow soldiers while dragging him is so stupidly done.  Doenst matter what button you hit, you just drag him in the way Activision wants it to drag him.Will I play out the campaign? No, i've seen it all in 1 hour.  It is just boring and there is nothing new under the hood.2)  Zombies: This is actually the mode I haven't played a lot in other cod's but here it is actually the best mode available.  The map is big, and I even get lost  and seperated from my teammates sometimes, but this is actually a really cooperative mode to play with.  In this mode you actually appreciate and help the other players.  Strangely graphic wise this looks better than the multiplayer.   Will i play this mode again: Definitely yes3) Multiplayer:Well this should be why i bought the game.  I was expecting a lot, even after playing the beta which was really smooth and the graphics were fine .   Then game this (full) version of the game and man what a dissapointment.It looked like they drew back the graphics.  Lots of it is blurry, the faces aren't detailed and look like legofaces.  No emotion on it.  The servers are laggy and there is lots of stuttering.Hit detection is garbage: 6 hits with an assualt rifle in torso and head, the other one kills me with one shot in the leg? like wtf.  Getting killed a lot by a player who missed the shot as seen in the killcam.  What is that all about.The footsteps of the soldiers are like the steps of little children running around.What is wrong with the supply drops and objectives.  They just reset or dissapear? Using a prestige weapon always resets the division after 1 play!Biggest issue for me is that my FOV is limited to 75 (21:9 screen in 3440 x 1440), which makes the gameplay slow as hell.  it's like running like a grandpa with a stick.  Enemies see mee much faster than i can see them.  And they said widescreens have an advantage above other screens?  This is 2017.  You don't limit the fps to 60 for ppl who have a 144+ fps monitor!  Because they have an advantage too.Things I like?  Well the headquarters are something new and nice to walk in aroud and it is played in WW2 (despite the inaccuracy) and currently that's about it.Will I ever like this game. Yes if they fix these issues and guarantee smooth gameplay and minor bugs.This wasn't thought wellthrough before launch.  Ppl pay a lot of money for this AAA game and they should deserve an AAA game for it."

												Wow this game sucks. Maybe if you paid 15 bucks for it it would be ok?The campaign is nothing like the wonderfully made, COD2. COD:WW2 only spans half of a year of the war, and nothing is really accomplished by the player. It's more about the emotional development of two of the characters than fighting a war. Each mission is the same: run in a straight line through enemy machine gun fire until you close in and shoot 6 Germans. Rinse and repeat. Also the historical accuracy of the game is frustratingly off. I hate seeing German troops armed mostly with Russian submachine guns and random shotguns. The tank mission is fun, but the plane mission is boring and hard to control. There is a mission where you play as a chick and you walk around an office building finding the location of a guy and giving him some paperwork. I'm not joking.The multiplayer is ok. Battlefield and Player Unknown's are much better.Nazi Zombies is as always pretty fun. Like I said, if you could buy it as a stand alone for 15 bucks, do it."

												Tl;dr - Crashes every single time I play it, whether single player or multiplayer.   The hardest part about the campaign was having to relaunch the game every 15 minutes due to broken textures not loading. Despite the technical flaws, the story was reasonably compelling and certainly better than more recent titles.   Multiplayer is average for the price, standard CoD experience although you don't get as much (maps or gamemodes) as you used to. Customisation is interesting, however a lot of it is left up to assumed knowledge and there's very little direction - I shouldn't have to Google what a 'prestige token' is because I haven't picked up a CoD game since BO1. From my perspective, the 'divisions' system is nowhere near what 'create-a-class' was in terms of innovation; overly complicated, lacking the format to show how best to go about constructing a soldier.    Overall, I was really looking forward to getting back into Call of Duty after a seven year break and Call of Duty: WWII is somewhat passable. I just wish they'd done a better job, or would hurry up and release a patch so it stops crashing on me.  6/10"

												It annoys me how the developers and publishers of this game thought that this game was in a good enough state to be released for full price.For starters, the stuttering. VSync is pretty much a must if you get this game because god forbid you hit 70 or more fps. I'd like to play a game of multiplyer where my fps doesn't drop from 100+ to the mid 20s for no reason.The amount of content in multiplayer. You give us thirteen maps but let's take away three because some can only be played in the War gamemode. Oh and let's take away one more because they want more money so you need to have the season pass to get access to it. So that's 9 maps... that's the lowest any CoD game has had at launch. And then for weapons, you have a decision, use a♥♥♥♥♥♥underpowered gun or use an overpowered gun so you're either play like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or use weak guns against ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.The zombies is brilliant, they made a fun but somewhat complex map. It's not easy to complete but not Shadows of Evil hard to beat (that map was so ♥♥♥♥ing confusing). The Pack-a-Punch is hard to understand but once you know what you're doing it is actually really easy. I've been told the boss fight isn't too hard (heard that from a friend so don't take my word) and it is actually enjoyable. Like, hours of playtime enjoyableThe campaign is... meh. Ignoring the absolutely god awful historical innaccuracies (Germans using Russian guns on D-Day? Really?), it is kinda fun to play through. It is a lot more violent from the other games but I feel like they just tried to show off their capabilites when it came to gore (Guy head blown in half by rifle at long range, not very accurate)All together, this game has it's good features and it's bad features but unfortunately, there's more bad than good and until they do buff the SMG and fix the servers and do everything else that the community wants, I can't recommend this game at full price. You did good Sledgehammer, but not good enough. And until you do enough, I will not support this game. Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together SledgehammerTL;DR:The game's good but Sledgehammer need to address the glaring issues like the lag and underpowered/overpowered weapons.

												If you are wondering should i buy this game? Well heres the answer for u.I have preordered this game fyi and through the weeks of playing this game i felt that this game is really just a bad game in general for its multiplayer. The campaign was Awsome and the Zombie mode was fun too BUT the multiplayer wasnt really that well developed.i live in south east asia (Singapore) run 200mbps network and its still having ping problems eventhough in game network says im having a good connections. i always gets kill first before i saw the enermy. i thought it maybe skills problem but nope.. my friends whom also play Cod ww2 also experience the same problem.For a new game like this there shouldnt be hackers right? Well during the first week of release i ran into 2 hackers that really ruins the experience.There is also alot of bugs example the daily mission, it didnt register the progress.Eventhough many people/Youtube shows how beautiful the game is but remember most of the youtubers have i7 or i9 running 2 gtx1080ti or 1080 at 4k60fps. For an average gamer like me running at i5 7400 and gtx 1060 6g the game is just bad graphics (lowest settings), getting about 120fps in and sometimes( with players around) it gets 83fps.Remember on lowest setting..For the Price SGD$85 isnt really worth it especially considering how bad the gameplay in multiplayer is and how limited the map is. For season pass its SGD$70.. just for a new map and some other items. I think they are just trying to make easy money with lesser work.So whats the overall rating?(Multiplayer) i would say 4/10The choice is in your hand whether to buy this game or not buy this game.For me i would rather spend the SGD$60+(prenium account) dollar on Battlefield 1 much better graphics, more fun, lesser hacker, not alot of ping issue and lesser bugs"

Call of duty can and will not ever provide the same feeling that games like battlefield and the tom clancy franchise can provide. PROS:It is finally back to ground troops and normal modern warfare.

												Edit: This is primarily a review on the multiplayer experience, and due to the game being split into campaign and multiplayer, the amount of playtime on my profile if incorrect. I have prestiged at the point of writing this review.I can't currently recommend this game, due to all of the bad bugs and such plaguing this game. I'm well beyond the ability to ask for a refund, so will just make the best of it, but this game has a lot of issues.Multiplayer games when winning will disconnect you as the match finishes, and will not reward you as if you won, and drop you back in the lobby like nothing happened.Variant guns will be removed from your class at the end of a match, and replaced with the basic rifle.Sometimes the face option you chose, will go to a random one and you have to switch it back.A lot of people just running around and spraying SMGs. Snipers will 180 turn and quick scope you even though you put several shots into them already. Some guns are just useless, and some are just to good not to use.Lag compensation seems to be big here, giving people with worse connections than you a significant advantage over you.While I do love the War Mode, and its objective based play, and that it has nothing to do with your K/D, there are only 3 maps, and they eventually turn into just a grind to get through them. Operation Neptune being the main offender here, as the first part of this, is a ""Storm the beaches and capture the bunkers"" objective. This mission just becomes dreadfully boring, or annoying, depending if you are defending or attacking.The game is fairly unbalanced, and bugs are not being resolved.

												Tl;dr - Crashes every single time I play it, whether single player or multiplayer.   The hardest part about the campaign was having to relaunch the game every 15 minutes due to broken textures not loading. Despite the technical flaws, the story was reasonably compelling and certainly better than more recent titles.   Multiplayer is average for the price, standard CoD experience although you don't get as much (maps or gamemodes) as you used to. Customisation is interesting, however a lot of it is left up to assumed knowledge and there's very little direction - I shouldn't have to Google what a 'prestige token' is because I haven't picked up a CoD game since BO1. From my perspective, the 'divisions' system is nowhere near what 'create-a-class' was in terms of innovation; overly complicated, lacking the format to show how best to go about constructing a soldier.    Overall, I was really looking forward to getting back into Call of Duty after a seven year break and Call of Duty: WWII is somewhat passable. I just wish they'd done a better job, or would hurry up and release a patch so it stops crashing on me.  6/10"

												COD WW2 definitely drew my interest to WW2 games and the era as a whole. However, it made me realise that other games have done the era in much better quality.  Games like Company of Heroes and the older Call of Duty games are much more effective at their portrayals, including the MG42 which feels more like the Browning rather than ""Hitler's Buzzsaw"". I also had some technical issues."

												Expected alot more of this. Multiplayer is crap. Everyone uses the same guns because all the other guns are bad. Zombies is more like a puzzle... I like my zombie games simple, kill zombies and survive. Without spending 30 minutes + to get upgraded weapons. Campaign quick events are so annoying aswell. This just feels so wrong...

COD finally great again??? (TL;DR at bottom)Since MW2 and MW3 I saw this wonderful franchise crumble. I played IW and regretted it. I missed the days of Finest Hour, the days that I was young and the game taught me about one of the worst wars (IMO) in history. Wow, those were the days. I miss them. So does COD WW2 finally reset the crosshairs on what made COD....COD? YES AND NO Does it play like a WW2 Call of Duty? Yes, however its modernized to keep up with the times (with cinematics, I'll get to that in a bit). The characters are memorable, the battles feel satisfying, weapons feel old and functional, its well balanced. YOU HAVE HEALTH PACKS!!!!! AI is quite nice as well. Banter and wittiness is also included. Quick time events are not needed and I felt took away from the game....if you mess an event up, it killed (pun intended) immersion. Another thing is it still doesn't feel 100% like a COD, and I think I found out why; the cinematics. It's too movie-like. It feels like its trying to be a Block-buster. Camera panning all over the place is pretty, but is taking away from the old school feel. Animations on some things are completely wrong! For those who have gotten ""Garand Thumb"", you know this is true! A Garand will SLAM shut upon loading a clip in. The story is great, painfully short, and doesn't include the Russian or African parts of the war...although It does include the French Resistance and SOE. Also the fact that I found a PPSH on the beaches of D-Day made me double take. I HIGHLY DOUBT that a Nazi soldier would have made it out alive from Stalingrad, went to Normandy with a PPSH, and proceeded to defend the beach. The MG15 was mostly used as a mounted aircraft weapon, not typically for ground troops. Also I can confirm there is some censorship of swastikas on uniforms. They are replaced with German iron crosses. *****Upon my research I've never seen an Iron cross arm band on ANY historic photos of WW2 that didn't include a swastika.****** Historical accuracy was missed (pun intended yet again).Graphics are excellent. Particles are great, blood/gibs/gore is good, and so on. It looks like a proper AAA title.Performance is sub-par. ""Call of Duty®: WWII creates the definitive World War II next generation experience"" (taken from the steam page). Direct X 11 API IS NOT ""NEXT GEN"" (its from 2011 and we are now in times of DX12 and Vulkan)! My system is a gtx 970 sc @1.4 GHz, 16gb ddr4 @2133 Ryzen R7 1700 stock extreme torture tested and stable and performance is underwhelming. The estimated v-ram bar in the settings said I was around 2.7 gb of usage, it typically was at 3.5 gb. GPU load varied from 60-100% and CPU load varied from 20-35%. I typically stayed at 50- 60 fps, but things could drop to 35 ish. Using the ""optimize video"" option put my system at low end settings. My system is far from low end as I have over 500 watts of total system cooling capability, a new r1700 CPU, and a large overclock on my still capable GPU. I also tuned settings to lean on the side of playability than graphics. THERE IS ALSO HORRID AUDIO PERFORMANCE; CLIPPING, SKIPPING, STATIC-Y. (tested on ASUS Strix 7.1, NEW OUT OF BOX g933, both with surround sound on and off). So how is multiplayer? Mostly the same as stated above, its overall very good. It beckons back to WAW! However I encountered a definite hacker. Also some people online are definitely what I call MLG's (Major League Gum-flappers). The typical insults and general nastiness that should stop. Competitiveness is one thing, but poor attitudes is another. The fact that there are only a few maps, few weapons, (the mosin, DPM, revolver, I could make a giant list of missing weapons) are available in a 2017 game makes me think that this will become DLC carpet bombing from the developers. Lets hope they think about their customers and help improve the game by giving more...not by slamming us across the face with micro-transactions.TL;DR and Final VerdictSo do I suggest this game?Both yes and no. Parts of it are great, but some of it is horribly broken.What do I rate it?It earns a thumbs down, the slight censorship (it isn't blatant black-barring like everyone made it out to be), historical inaccuracies, and sub-par performance is a BIG problem for me. I'd like to share a small saying from George Santayana considering there is slight censorship and inaccuracies however;""Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it"""

												This game had very much potential, but sledgehammer made it.Cons1. zombies is not like I had expected, instead of a survival type senerio there are objectives. and it has more of a extinction mode feel (from cod ghosts).2. Inacurate, as we all know there were no black or female nazi soldiers (come on sledge get it right)3.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FULL WW2 CAMPAIGN IT IS NOT HERE. There is only the western front, so only americans british, French(kind of) and nazis. There are no Japs, Russians, Italians, or Chinese. 4. Very little differnt types of multiplayer gamemodes.5.It feels like they tried to copy the home screen for BF1 on the multiplayer (they should have made something more unique)If they atleast put in the Pasific theater then the game would have been 100% better than it is now.Pro's1.Good campaign.2.thats all I got lmaoDO NOT BUY FOR A FULL WW2 EXPEREANCE*I may change my review later but for now not worth the money*"

I experienced graphics at the lowest settings and freezing once every 5 minutes using old 17.7.1. Even tried switching to Windows 7 and 10 installs. Increased graphic quality but freeze began within 2 minutes each time.If you run Windows 8/8.1 with an AMD card, good luck to you!"

												A decent single-player game but if you want to play with a keyboard and mouse I'd think seriously if you want the frustration that comes with playing it. There is a mission with a tank that basically stopped me in my tracks as the mouse rotates the turret far too slowly to fight and the directional control is all over the place. At this stage I'm not sure I'll be going back to it which is annoying when you've paid so much for a game. This could be the first CoD game I don't finish and it looks like it will probably be the last one I buy."

												I havent played the COD series since MW and I stopped because of the lack of servers for the PC gamer. The PC gamers that actually made the franchise and then got passed over for consoles so the owners could get more money with a much lower investment by not providing dedicated servers (or letting anyone else host them). This type of console play makes for very average PC game play at best this type of hosting system for PC's is rubbish (still rubbish after all this time). The rhetoric from the writer is we are looking after PC gamers this time and this is just not true - it runs like a dog and depending on where its hosted depends on if you can hit anything or just get pwned. The way it works now is pathetic for PC,  it doesnt matter if you have skills just be in a favoured locality to host and you will reign supreme. I run a very good 100M business connection with very low latency so I know its not my connection. Yet after all the various previous versions and the problems PC gamers have had with them, we still get the same story from the makers we are going to make this work with PC's. In reality we are getting lip service we have a game optimised for consoles that plays very badly on PC.  So I wouldnt recommend  to anyone that they should buy this for PC and to be fair I've given this a good run since day 1 of release but the problems make it very frustrating. The fact that they have released software that is still in Beta / RC1 is incredible in this day and age (as confirmed by the fix list). Finally when you are going to make $200-300M USD within days of release you do have an obligation to get it right  - its not like this is the first time the game has been released and its mostly rehash of the same old thing...................? Score out of 10  - I give it a 3 for graphics and current gameplay - spend your hard earned $ on something better with a company that supports PC gamers and dedicated regional servers."

												So ... this was it.Not that i wasnt warned or not expecting it ... this game as it is does not worth the price payed.Single player is way to short ... despite being well made, great graphics and sound, i dont knowif the dlc's that will follow can make it better, but as it is right now ... it doesnt justify the price most people payed for it.The French part of the campaign feels so rushed ... no vilages no nothing ... and they had so much they could do ... we practicly dont see Germany, you want to get to Berlin ... forget about it ... you will probably have to pay more for that later on ... they spend the whole game talking about Kasserine , i bet they will let you play it later on if you pay for it ... and etc etc etc ... I am a WWII fan and that is the main reason why i got this ... and yes mainly for the single player i hate the way that political correctness got in to games and pretty much ruin them even more, this game could be a great and epic experience ... but no ... it fails miserably short of that ... if you didnt buy it yet and you are a WWII fan like i am, wait for a 50% or even a 75% discount ...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------so i came back to this review just to say that the multiplayer is disapointing ... headless chikens running in circles with guns ... maps are too small, tactics or team actions are pretty much impossible, i swear ... its just a bunch of people running and shooting ... getting shot in the back right after respawn allot... one good think is the kill cam ...it allowed me to see that despite the game being recent there are cheaters allready ... also teams feel to small ...at this time we should be able to get large maps and large battles with much more players.nazi zombies can be fun ... if you are lucky on what players you get to play with ..."

												Firstly this game is not recommended and even if it was on sale at £5 I still would not recommend it, Quite frankly this is a joke. And so you know my stance on the COD franchise, I am not one of those people who bash it for the sake of bashing it I enjoy it when the game is good or hasd good gameplay elements. I have played all call of duties except the third and therefor my opinion would be biased towards enjoying it. I will only be talking about the multiplayer since 1) who the ♥♥♥♥ care about call of duty single players 2) Its a QTE ridden on rail piece of crap 3) As my mate describes the ENTIRE opening section is ripped straight from medal of honor frontlines.The multiplayerAuthenticity.""At Sledgehammer Games, everything begins with authenticity."" This is the first sentence of the description in their youtube video of WW"" shown off in May. Don't believe me look: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBdsud-0i24 This game is about as far from authenticity as you could possibly get. For starters females in the multiplayer. Fine whatever go PC friendly even though this is a HUGE slap in the face to authenticity. THEN, the female characters are wearing makeup. What, ♥♥♥♥ing makeup. You are a female soldier running around the ♥♥♥♥ing frontlines and you are wearing ♥♥♥♥ing blusher. What the hell is this, in what way is this authentic. You can get cold, copper, bronze and diamond camos. Because my grandfather often told me of the times he came up to the french border with his comrades, gunfire above them, sound of explosions in the air muffling the orders of his commander. Praying with his comrades they would make it out alive before him and his troops stormed the black female makeup wearing nazi's using their russain SMG's who had taken over france while he stormed in his ghillie suit dual weilding diamond camo M1911's and german golden kar 98 on his back wearing his bright white beta helmet to take back the land as he quickscoped flamethrower weilding nazi's like it was just another day on the frontlines. Then after all this was done setup oon the front lines playing cards and his comrades threw smokes down and supply drops rained down from the heavens to aquire pistol grips for their diamond camo 1911's... Do they even know what the definition of authentic is, did you even think sledgehammer when you were adding these choices. Did you think sledgehammer, did you for 1 minute in this entire♥♥♥♥♥♥show of a gamestep back and actually think about any of the design, gameplay, gunplay, visual audio choices and think maybe they were bad. Clearly not.Gameplay.Coming from IW this is painfully slow movement but even more painful then that of prior CODs. You can sprint for about 3s before you need to no longer sprint and when your character moves at about 1 unit per millenium it makes it painfully slow to get anywhere onthe map catering to the camping play style. The only way I have been able to navigate and not fall asleep is by fog hopping (continuously dolphin diving) since this moves you at full sprint speed without using up stamina.  Atleast in the other CODs such as WaW this entire thing was done infinitely better by you moving alot faster and sprinting for longer. The walls in this game are made from paper. I could try using a 5 inch brick wall as cover and someone shooting at me with a 9mm with penetrate it like its nothing stopping me regening my health and preventing me getting back in the gunfight. And on the topic of health regen it takes way too ♥♥♥♥ing long. This is a game where you spawn into gunfire instantly especially with the broken spawns and its takes well over 5 seconds to regen you health. What. Why, who thought this would be a good idea. Gunplay.Gunplay, what gunplay. Idk who in the hell over at sledgehammer games designed this gunplay and balance but I am fairly certain if i headbutted my numpad to come up with the values for weapon it would come out with better weapon balance then the joke it currently is. For starters theres 4 snipers, 7 ""rifles"" with 3 being what I would consider viable. For instance the first gun you unlock being the M1941 and then the STG unlocked a little later. The M1941 has a better firerate. The stg has faster ttk, no recoil, more bullets in a mag and much better range.Spawns.This would normally go into gunplay but there is a special place in hell for the person that designed these spawns and at the end of♥♥♥♥♥thought 'oh boy did I do good'. Here is a common instance, I went into a match with the perk that causes my screen to glow yellow if someone isn't in my line of sight but can see me. I spawned in and my screen was yellow, I turn to kill this guy and it's still yellow, I kil the first guy and turn to see 2 guys in my face with my screen STILL YELLOW, meaning there is still someone behind me. Naturally I die because I am not the terminator. In the 3rd person death screen I see 4 guys run by meaning this games spawn system spawned me into the entire enemy team. Line of sight doesn't matter to these spawn it will just spawn enemies in it. Another instance I was watching an angle from a window and i was ads. An enemy spawned in my reticle. My exact line of sight an enemy spawned in. No more needs to be said.Maps.For starters there is only 9 maps in the whole game. Campare that the 13-17 we have recieved the past few years this is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. Then the maps themselves are terrible. I can honestly say there is 1 map in the whole game that I would consider tollerable and that would be the one set in london. The maps have no rhyme or reason to them and cater heavily towards headglitching and camping which is not fun for anybody playing the game. Every maps is ♥♥♥♥ing tiny with the exception of 1 which is basically a massive square the dwarfs derail from mw2, with a ♥♥♥♥ing centre high elevation area that puts the centre elevation in rust from mw2 to shame giving anybody who has control of the centre map full line of sight to each spawn (which is 4 corners of the map) and these 4 corners are a building. Each map is♥♥♥♥♥♥lines of sight and every player I spoke to also agrees that the maps are terrible. BugsHeres the bugs and boy have I found some. First off I have the pre-order version so I got free access to a thing called the MP pack. This gives me a prestige token and double XP. to get this you need to go in the new headquarters which is a crappy hub world designed to artifically lengthen gameplay time where you have a mailbox and crap. All my preorder rewards were in the mailbox. I redeem my mp pack but it kicks me out of the headquarters and to the lobby of the MP match as I redeem it glitching it and now I don't have my token. Amazing, contacted support and they are still 'getting the tools'Optimisation.Who cares, the game is terrible. I play on a 680 and its fine when it isn't stuttering randomly or my keyboard doesn't lock up preventing inputs for a good 20 years. Others were complaining of this in public matches also so it isn't just me. Ther fov defaults itself back to 65 whenever you restart the ♥♥♥♥ing game so when you play for 2 hours and wonder why you feel sick, theres your answer.Last statement is this game apparantly took 3 years to develop however is by far the worst call of duty maade. It takes all the bad from both new and old CODs then decides to up the ante and make them as bad as they possibly can go. There is no gun balance, terrible spawns, terrible maps, terrible graphics, terrible optimisation, annoying bugs, rediculous call outs, immersion breaking design choices at every corner and much much more. I feel like they were making advanced warfare 2 then the IW trailer released and god the backlash it did. Activision♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves and said 'quick lads go make a game not set in the future' and sledgehammer had to scramble together to make this game in a year or so. Want a good WW2 cod, go buy WaW, or cod classic, or cod 2, or 3, or literally anything ever made but this."

												Terrible game, multiplayer is buggy as hell. Constant display driver stopped working with the latest driver from nvidia for the 1080ti. Reinstalled windows and lost alot of game time and still the issue happens with only this game installed. Multiplayer needs A TON OF WORK! randomly dying around corners and when you move around all of the sudden you die and seen no one in front of you while the kill cam shows you ran right into someone and they just blew you away. Nevermind I have 100mbps down/10mbps up. It's all dependent on the hosts connection which usually sucks. ALOT OF PEOPLE are using LAG SWITCHES TO SCREW YOU OVER! Only good part about this game is Nazi zombies and they only included 2 maps :( Wait for the game to go on sale for 20 bucks. I wouldn't pay more than 30 bucks for it. Season pass? Hell no, wait until ALL DLC is released becuase by then alot of these issues should be fixed.Oh and don't forget every game you'll have some rasist child screaming the N-word all over into the mics and spamming chat with it.

As of 7/11/17 this game isn't worth the money. Having 24 hours clocked into the MP I think this review will be more effective then a 0.7H one. Pro's  Headquarters(HQ)-You got a variety of things to do there, going out from firing range. scorestreak tower(get a hold of the scorestreaks.) to a 1v1 arena that you can show off to your friends that your'e better then them. Daily&Weekly contracts-You get 6 24h contracts and 3 weekly contracts that dosn't require from you alot to acomplish(grinding) by finishing the contracts your getting XP boosts, supply drops and soical points(depends on the contract itself.)  Most of the guns don't feel nerfed nor OP, either one will work if you can handle it. Map's are balanced in most cases, so there aren't favored sides. Con's  Servers/Hosts- 40% of my in-game time is spend on searching lobby without having a host with a slow internet/pc, it feels like the host is selected randomly and not prefable by the majority.An example- you enter a match and find out that out of 12 people in the match only 1/2/3 people got green/orange ping, that means the host's of the match are from the US while the rest are from Europe. You can't do anything unless the host leaves, if you chose to get out and try find a normal lobby you get ""punished"".if you had an acvtive boost/contract the time remined on it was wasted and you get reduced exp from the next matches.If you do find a lobby and finish the match, there's a high chance that you can d/ced and anything beside the exp that you achived wasn't recorded.That mean's if you lacked that 1 win to finish the contract or that few kills welp good luck ""rolling the dices"" on the next match and hope not to get d/ced.  Glitches/Bugs- When you prestige you have a chance not to receive any contracts or supply drops.Some heroic weapons can reset your class after the match.Post game supply drops aren't being received alto you were picked to receive it.(like CSGO crate drops)In the zombie mod you hear a high pitched buzzing that doesn't fade away unless you exit the match. There's way to much bugs/glitches to list it here and will take me the 5 times longer to finish this review.  Lack of support- If you try to report a personal problem that your having you wont get any support, activision twitter will just ask you to send a DM on twitter and wont responed to it no metter how unplayble it is. No one knows who's the community manager is or there are no posts from the studio keeping you updated, mostly they're responed will be ""were working on it"". TL;DR/Overall Don't buy the game right now, dont support it until they will fix the major issue.When everything is fixed(mostly the servers) then consider checking it out, its nice to get back to the roots and noting seems to be wrong gameplay wise."

												Before you say I only have 0.1 hours on record check my steam and you will see i have like 80 hours in multiplayer.This game had so much potential for a good year on PC. However they continue to not care about us PC players and focus only on the console ""Gamers"". This is the second COD i have bought on PC so I am relitivly new PC COD, however i am not new to PC gaming as i have been playing games on PC for some time now. There are many problems with this COD and many of them they wont fix. The most important being the amount of cheaters/hackers playing the game. I would say that around 40-50% of lobbies have atleast 1 or more cheaters/hackers in it. This makes the game literally unplayable which is sad since i bought the season pass edition and will very rarely play this game unless certain fixes are made. I understand that cheaters/hackers in COD PC is not unnormal but at this point in game development it should be alot harder to make/get hacks for this game, especially since its a AAA title made buy a AAA company. Another problem is how they are going to release updates. Slegehammer have already said that separate updates for weapon tuning for console and PC wont be happening. This to me and others is simply dumb. Certain guns are much better on PC then they are on console and thats a fact. Im not going to say which guns are better and need re-adjusting for PC but i think you can figure it out if you put some time into the game. Some thing they should do to really help COD grow and I genuinlly believe they would make more money out of is to lower the base price of the game. Why you might ask? The PC community is known for spending large amounts in crates and microtransactions (Which are already in WW2). For Example look at CSGO, PUBG or DOTA you will see how much money is put into this marketplace. By simply making this game more affordable to buy its base game they people who actually buy the game are more then likely going to put money in it at some point if the game is playable and runs good. I know this is asking alot of Activision but in realistic terms this is asking nothing but a chance for them to grow a community that is already growing so fast and growing their chance to really make alot of profit since this game is just a port from console and doesnt cost them a whole lot of money converting. To end off I just want to say if Activision is going to release ported COD to PC and not care enough to atleast make it worth the money just please stop releasing it on PC and focus just on console becuase quite frankly I dont want any incentive buying a game that doesnt get certain updates it needs to grow for this platform, at this moment i feel like this company doesnt care about their games and i see this as a trend that is already very vibrant in the Call of Duty communiy."

												The game isnt as bad as everyone is saying. Is it by any means good? Not really. Its just... average. Its painfully average. Wheres my thumbs in the middle option, Steam?Il give a tl;dr here:Single player is okay. The story does captures some grusome detail of WWII, but other than that its okay. The D-Day mission was fun. However, story mode is way too ♥♥♥♥ing short. Of course you have characters, some you may or may not like. Literally only one of them are Memorable (barely) and thats cause of thier name. But what kind of story mode do you expect from CoD? Since day one the narritave has always been an exuse for you to move to the next room and mow down more bad guys.Multiplayer is what you expect. Its average.Nazi zombies is arguably the best part of CoDWWII in my opinion. Whats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is that single player and multiplayer are still 2 seperate options. WTF devs, this isnt 2007. Just roll it into one ♥♥♥♥ing application it makes life easier.In summary, CoD is slowly taking steps to at least be average as opposed to the 100%♥♥♥♥♥♥show its been for the past few years. Hopefully this trend continues and CoD eventually comes to its senses and becomes a great series again.Dont buy this game until the price drops or it goes on sale. Or if you have a disposible income, guess thats okay too."

												Campaign was pretty nice, great scenario and audiovisual fidelity.Multiplayer is sadly yet another laggy and desynced mess, but i guess it is to be expected from these amateur second rate developers. If you can stand the inconsistency in TTK caused by lag and constant weird deaths/killcams that dont reflect what you saw in the game at all, there are also other issues; spawns dont seem to make any sense in any mode causing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and chaotic gameplay and weapon balance favors full auto guns way too much.The multiplayer is basically a great scenario held hostage by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ development. Seems only Treyarch can do functional and fun CoD multiplayer these days. Too damn bad that the WW2 setting didnt get made by them.

												Disclaimer-havent been a fan of CoD since my Xbox 360 days so this may not surprise people when i say i dislike this game a lot.The campaign is short and lacking in back story like other CoD games  *coughs* treyarch ones *coughs*. Graphically the game is stunning and really surprised me just like the fact they are still using the same running mechanic where trained soldiers can only run 15m tops and the same bullet mechanic where they are treated like rays of light instead of actual in game objects. Gun fire rates just dont seem right and the splash damage on launchers feels like you are throwing water balloons unless you are using the rifle grenade on the campaign in which case you are full equiped with miniature neuclear warheads. The online system isnt too dissimilar to black ops 3 just minus the dabbing as far as i saw but its still not much better, your team getting steamrolled and the top 3 of their team celebrating your deaths post game is just Sodium enducing at best. i was hopeful for this game and really wanted it to be what CoD was missing but it wasnt, that is partly my fault for believing it might be but its mostly down to the hype train surrounding this games pre release. If you are a die hard franchise fan i have no doubt you will like this game and disagree but here i am disliking both the new battlefield and the new cod games, shooters seem to have gone down the swanny as of late."

												Uh...., if going to war in WWII, a war in which 65, 000, 000., that’s right, 65 million., died in a 6 year span, give or take; the biggest worry you've got is pleasing your SGT., something isn't right. The game is alright, it's nothing special. The cinematics are okay, the story is just at okay and believe me, I’m stretching this (the fact that the game is historically inaccurate, given the publicity that the devs spent time and money researching the war to make a historically accurate and real depiction is an outcry), the mechanics are okay, the return to health kits not regen health is okay, it’s all just okay…,  NOT worth $60, but okay.The game just bounds from pointless mission location and objectives to another. The game lacks the mission importance of WWII western-front operations. It just kind of bounces from one flak cannon, to a tank, to some endless horde of counter-attacking Nazis in some hedgerow. All the while, you as the player, has no idea where you are in the world, or what the ♥♥♥♥ you’re doing besides just trying to please your SGT who has some previously, weakly, established hatred of his men, or is it love, can’t tell through all the cliché ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t…Save your money, get this on sale.

Not as many as you'd usually get on an initial CoD release- Your FOV resets every time you launch the game- Some classes resetting and still no support from the developersPros- Lots of effort put into Nazi Zombies but with one map its getting pretty repetitive already- Graphics are nice, sfx good tooI'm sure in time they'll eventually fix the issues that make it game breaking unless they ditch it and go onto make another quick buck with another release."

												I feel like this should have been a return to form. This is the first CoD that I've played since Black Ops II - the last one worth playing in my opinion - and it just wasn't what I was really hoping for. It's honestly depressing (and a bit embarrassing, since I fell for the season pass meme as well) to see that the series still hasn't really changed at all since I quit playing. High-rate-of-fire and one-shot kill weapons still dominate multiplayer. Cover is still useless. Quickscoping, the most nonsensical mechanic to plague a series, still exists, and is still objectively the most effective and easy tactic to dominate multiplayer with.You know what this feels like to me? Modern Warfare 3. That was, in my opinion, the first game in the series to really drop the ball and never improve itself, and this feels like a re-hash of that occasion. What I (and, I think, many longtime fans) wanted was a new and improved version of the classic games and World at War, but what we have is Baby's First Montage Simulator with a coat of army green and some Band of Brothers bumper stickers plastered all over it. Forget Battlefield 1 and its absurd proliferation of weird prototype guns and black Russians - there's not an unscoped bolt-action rifle, effective semi-auto or hard-to-control SMG in sight. It's the same old spray-and-pray, sit in a corner sucking your thumb, then get shot by a sniper rifle at shotgun range routine that we're all too familiar with at this point.It doesn't feel like WW2, and it doesn't feel like a return to form.

Playing as germans, and the run around with M1 Garands and carbines - wtf!Multiplayer maps are insane small - you die every 30 secs - 5 secs when hackers are present. Weapons such as M1 garands and rifles are totally obsolete as close encounters occur constantly, so SMG's are the only way you survive.Snipers are WAY TOO OP. They don't even have to aim at you, and can run and shoot you - hope that'll be fixed soon.But the worst problem is the hackers and lack of dedicated servers.As the game is right now, I wouldn't recommend you using your hardearned bucks on it."

												By far the worst COD game I have ever played. This game totally broke my faith in the franchise and I don't think I will ever buy another COD game after this. Way too disappointing. The Bads:- Too much tough guy talk and cheesy dialogue - Some parts were totally replays of cliche scenes from Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers- 4 guys in a Jeep taking out a speeding German armoured train guarded by an infantry company? Really?- The only real way of taking out Germans is to snipe and score headshots. But if you're using a SMG, you need many headshots to kill a German. Don't bother on bodyshots. A German soldier in this game can take many bullets to the torso and keep fighting. MG42s were nasty in WW2 but in this game they are like nerf guns. Takes way too many MG42 bullets to kill an enemy soldier. Might as well just use an M1. - The headbobbing, camera shake and awkward running motion makes this a pukefest for anyone prone to motion sickness. They need to go easy on the camera movement. - There are way too many dramatic Hollywood-style action movie scenes. Do you devs really think that the audience nowadays are gonna feel immersed in a game like that? It was good in Modern Warfare 1 and 2. We loved that. That doesn't mean it will be good in World War 2. - Melee action felt like pillow fights. You can whack a guy over the head with the butt of your rifle and the guy will recover in a second and unload a mag in your face. - Too many Quick-Time events that do not need to be there. - Tank movement controls are counter-intuitive. I see that the devs are trying to make tanks move the way they think infantry should move. But its a tank! When the tank's chassis is facing front, pressing W should move the tank in the direction the chassis is pointing, not turn it to face where the turret is facing! Making the tank move like infantry is a horrible design choice. The Goods:- Great graphics. Character faces look photorealistic. - Cutscenes are beautiful. I can't force myself to complete the campaign of this game. I used to play through every campaign in every COD game that I've purchased in the past. Not this. I am too disgusted to finish this one. If you can't do a good single player campaign, I don't have much faith in the rest of the game. You guys just killed COD for me."

You are right ! SMG FTW3) Hackers.... Its been 2 days and 15 cods and the still dont get it.4) no dedicated servers ( at this point, it will be idiot to even hope they will put them back)5) Too fast... just too fast. Like the movement of your caracter, the sprint, the reload speed, the game itself its too fast. Like the COD serie is getting closer to Unreal tournement/ quake than the older cods. its just dumb. Its just a pure run and gun there is no strategic movement looking around corner aiming while moving, none. just run hip fire, bunny hope/ jump shot. It might sounds stupid, but you just cant camp.6) Dont sniper. The game is too fast you have no chance to snipe anybody. The were OP in the beta ( quickscope and the bad hitbox) but they nerfed it and its unplayable. the aiming time is so bad you cant get the scope on your eye cuz you're all ready dead.7)Servers are bad The campaign looks good, the zomby mod to.

												Okay so my breakdown of this game:Pro:Great graphicsNice engineCons:Multiplayer is packed with cheaters packing 50 kills in 6 minutes matches!! Wall hackers, aimbotters etc. And the devs aren't doing anything about it.The game is crazy historical inaccurate. Playing as germans, and the run around with M1 Garands and carbines - wtf!Multiplayer maps are insane small - you die every 30 secs - 5 secs when hackers are present. Weapons such as M1 garands and rifles are totally obsolete as close encounters occur constantly, so SMG's are the only way you survive.Snipers are WAY TOO OP. They don't even have to aim at you, and can run and shoot you - hope that'll be fixed soon.But the worst problem is the hackers and lack of dedicated servers.As the game is right now, I wouldn't recommend you using your hardearned bucks on it."

												By far the worst COD game I have ever played. This game totally broke my faith in the franchise and I don't think I will ever buy another COD game after this. Way too disappointing. The Bads:- Too much tough guy talk and cheesy dialogue - Some parts were totally replays of cliche scenes from Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers- 4 guys in a Jeep taking out a speeding German armoured train guarded by an infantry company? Really?- The only real way of taking out Germans is to snipe and score headshots. But if you're using a SMG, you need many headshots to kill a German. Don't bother on bodyshots. A German soldier in this game can take many bullets to the torso and keep fighting. MG42s were nasty in WW2 but in this game they are like nerf guns. Takes way too many MG42 bullets to kill an enemy soldier. Might as well just use an M1. - The headbobbing, camera shake and awkward running motion makes this a pukefest for anyone prone to motion sickness. They need to go easy on the camera movement. - There are way too many dramatic Hollywood-style action movie scenes. Do you devs really think that the audience nowadays are gonna feel immersed in a game like that? It was good in Modern Warfare 1 and 2. We loved that. That doesn't mean it will be good in World War 2. - Melee action felt like pillow fights. You can whack a guy over the head with the butt of your rifle and the guy will recover in a second and unload a mag in your face. - Too many Quick-Time events that do not need to be there. - Tank movement controls are counter-intuitive. I see that the devs are trying to make tanks move the way they think infantry should move. But its a tank! When the tank's chassis is facing front, pressing W should move the tank in the direction the chassis is pointing, not turn it to face where the turret is facing! Making the tank move like infantry is a horrible design choice. The Goods:- Great graphics. Character faces look photorealistic. - Cutscenes are beautiful. I can't force myself to complete the campaign of this game. I used to play through every campaign in every COD game that I've purchased in the past. Not this. I am too disgusted to finish this one. If you can't do a good single player campaign, I don't have much faith in the rest of the game. You guys just killed COD for me."

												The story mode was aiight. Wasn't bad could use some more improvement especially in the ending I don't know if it was because I played the story mode at night on release when I was partially tired but the ending just appeared out of no where. SIngle player is like the beta, the first few days the beta was good but then on the last 2 days teh game felt bad like nothing was connecting, then the hackers came out. Now for multiplayer it's the same issue. The first week the game felt amazing everything was connecting then during the second week of release it got bad  you're shooting people but nothing is connecting, hackers are slowly rolling out and they aren't getting ban.  3 hackers reported during the codrace and tehy still haven''t ban especially since they hacked their way up to the top of the leaderboard. Step yo game up SHG.Update December 9: Game is extremely unstable and more hackers are around, Connection is a huge problem people seeing you before you see them, it also introduces shoot first die first scenarios, when sniping hit boxes are the size of  hulk's body, there are times when the game feels like it has some sort of vsync enabled introducing mouse input lag. With many many other issues that are unexplanable from an unprofessional software developer individual."

												Quick review for anyone who hopes this game will be anything like the original Call of Duty or like Call of Duty 2. You will mostly enjoy the singeplayer with some nice visuals and sounds, plus some interesting missions in different locations. You might however think like me that the game can be overly dramatic at time with many close call escapes, too many in my opinion. Main con being that you only play as on nation and the story can sometimes get in the way of actually fighting the war.Multiplayer - It's essentially nothing like the original or 2. Much like recent COD's its essentially just everyone sprinting around with SMG's. The unlock system (which I find childish and boring) means that you can never play with the weapon you want if you're a casual player and means that those who play constantly always have an advantage over you. The main reason I find that I'm not enjoying the MP is that the maps are designed to support the first point here. They are narrow and cluttered meaning you're just running into enemies rather than having a tactical firefight (you know, like warfare..) If you're looking for the fun you had playing S&D on maps like Brecourt, Dawnville and Depot, you probably won't find it here. If you're looking for the experience you've had from MW onwards but with vaguely accurate WW2 weapons then you'll be happy here. Would I recommend? Yes, for the SP on the cheap in a sale at some point but No if, like me, you were hoping to reminisce about hundreds of hours spent on COD1 MP."

												Honestly cannot recommend this game based on my experiences so far...  Has not been a fun experience... I tried giving it chances as I played but it's really disappointing.. There's tons of little annoying things about it.. Just read the reviews on here, most people are hitting the nail on the head.  What really did it for me was when I got frustrated with multiplayer and wanted to just relax and enjoy the campaign... the quicktime events are ASININE.  The mouse events where you have to bring your mouse to the center, gives you like .2 seconds to react, and even if you do react, you'd have to throw your mouse across the room to make the stupid thing move to the center quick enough.  So I had to redo the same quick time event scene over and over until the randomness worked in my favor and the mouse was close enough to the circle to make it possible, even then, it was a minimum of 3 full mouse space movements in half a second, and I have a huuuge desk space that is ALL mouse space, and it was STILL difficult.  But it doesn't end there... once I got the mouse to the center, I am asked to press a key to kinda seal it in and not die.  What key do I need to press? ""Unbound""SO.  Multiple attempts, finally get it, and then the key that they want me to press is ""Unbound""Literally couldn't even do it.  Had to go through my settings and make sure all of my keys were bound to SOMETHING.   Just leaves an awful taste in my mouth at how lazy they seem to be.. I really do just feel cheated out of my money.  Online isn't working now, so I figured it was a good time to leave a nice review of my experience. lol  Couldn't get a refund because I triiiied to give it a chance and played for more than 2 hours (Dumbest policy in my opinion).. just not enjoying it currently.  Since I'm stuck with it, I'll give it a few more chances and maybe one day change my mind.  But first impressions. AWFUL.  Bitter bitter taste in my mouth."

												First, I've only played Multiplayer.There are already cheaters. Folks who even admit to cheating. It just totally ruins the game and I'm not sure why they can't ban as quickly as Destiny 2 has been. Instead if we get any real bans at all, it'll likely be in crappy waves every few months which means the majority of the time, this game will be awful to play in multiplayer.Lastly, the maps, they are small and are just like 'modern' CoD maps in other CoD games. So if you think because it's WW2 you'll get the awesome big huge maps of yesteryear, nope."

Like literally it's exactly 10 minutes till it crashes. Happened to me in the beta and still happening in the full version. Complete waste of 60 USD if all you're gonna do is grind Multiplayer. If the game is more optimized and able to run without crashes then the game is completely worth 60 USD, but in it's current condition DO NOT buy it. Please stop optimizing for consoles first then porting it to PC, because that doesn't work and it ruins the game.

												The historian responsible for getting this game `right`...Mr Martin `Marty` K.A.Morgan Should be ashamed!  I would not want my name to be a part of this title.  I was hoping for something realistic, not this.  If anyone thinks this is what war is like, you are very, very mistaken.Having played all game types and spent some time on the game I wholeheartedly do NOT Recommend this game unless you like mindless, unrealistic FPS shootem-ups.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxkNQ-Bn5M&list=PL-Al6rzTlW-hxisKZsu6aStnJ21GrlXfoI know that COD has always been this type of game but I was hoping it would have grown up, so I am hangin up my boots as I hate everything about COD WW2.Even the Campaign, which initially I loved has been turned into a ridiculous 80's game where enemies continue to spawn until you have pushed far enough forwards.  The beach landing is too short, the historical inacuracies are absolutely everywhere!!The number of shots required to kill and enemy is only there to mask how shallow this game is.  There is no `real`  challenege to the game so they have simply faked it with an endless supply of reinforcements and bullet proof soldiers.  Even on the Veteran level it takes 2-10 hits on an enemy to kill them, and if you don't do it quickly enough their energy is replaced.There is little to no cover, and the peak feature only works sometimes.  Your teammates are right next to flipping useless, either standby and offer no cover or support or they run into your gun and you start the round over!The zombies gamemode is OK I guess but not clean and just not really fun either anymore.I must admit I had some elements of fun on Hardcore MP, but to be honest the intensity of the game sucks, there little to no skill it is about knowing the map, having a good gun and having unlocked features that allow you to aim and shoot quickly.I say again...if anyone thinks this is what war is like, you are very, very mistaken.CAMPAIGN REVIEW **************************https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxkNQ-Bn5M&list=PL-Al6rzTlW-hxisKZsu6aStnJ21GrlXfoWhilst my Overall impression of the BETA MP was very dissapointing, this campaign is exceptionally good.  If relism is your thing then there IS a lot here that will tickle you toes;Graphics 8/10Audio 10/10Difficulty on Hardest level (the only way I play) Excellent but not realistic obviously.Overall the level of immersion is very, very high and the campaign in multiplayer could be an outstanding experience!I've had a few bugs.  The most noticeable being total loss of audio and the sudden inability to heal my character.  Returning to the previous checkpoint failed to resolve the problem, other than that no issues.Glad to see some for of cover being applied, seemed to be missing in the BETA experience.  There are also some nice areas where you can utilise things within the game as cover, like kicking a table over. OVERALL************In no way am I won over, but I expected to hate this and I really, really did not!  My Recommendation right now is ""not recommended"" purely because of my bad experience with the BETA, but I am going to try all game modes out and update accordingly."

The campaign is fairly short, it's divided into eleven chapters, most of which are incredibly brief. The campaign overall is a mixed bag, It won't blow you away, that's for sure.Sledgehammer games tried very hard to make you like the characters, but unfortunately each and every single one of them is easily forgettable. The campaign doesn't feel very polished too, some chapters are interesting, like the bastogne or fight for the hill 433, but the majority of them are not very exciting, especially the couple of chapters where it's prefferable to sneak your way through, let me tell you one thing, the stealth system doesn't work for this game, AT ALL. The level design is very narrow, the enemy AI is beyond dumb, they're either standing or crouching in one place waiting for you to take them out with ease. They rarely try to flank you or outnumber you. I don't know what it is exactly, but the game just feels unfinished to me. The game feels like the developers weren't given much time to polish it. Or they focused most of their developement time on the multiplayer and zombies portion of the game. There's no replay value once you beat the campaign the first time. Sound design is hit and miss aswell, most of the guns sound generic, so do their reload animations. The graphics are ok, but nothing to brag about, that's for sure. There is a huge disparity between the prerenderred cutscenes and the in game cutscenes, it feels weird. For some reason cod ww2 reminds me of medal of honor warfighter. Mainly because the focus on the characters, rather than the confict. And the amount of doors you have to open, lol. Oh and one more thing, who the hell asked for the goddamn QTE's? They're bugged if you have the vsync turned off, which I had because I couldn't stand the mouse lag when it was turned on.COD WW2 campaign feels like a mixed bag, it's neither bad, nor is it good. It's somewhere in the middle, definitely one of the least memorable call of duty campaigns. I wouldn't say that it's as bad as Black Ops 3, but it's most definitely not as good as the old call of duty games. I was really looking forward to this years call of duty game, as Iam a big fan of the advanced warfare campaign, but unfortunately I was a bit disappointed in the overall quality of the campaign.I consider myself a big call of duty fan, but even then I would not recommend this game. If you're getting the game for the campaign solely, don't, you'll be disappointed like me."

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. I know there's a COD hate bandwagon but I assure you, I'm not part of that. I've played every COD released to date and I enjoy the series for what it is, but the past several years have led to not much but disappointment and a lot of people agree on that point. Now, I did appreciate the atmosphere, but I found it kind of hard to appreciate much more of the game. The campaign felt like a cheap and unoriginal movie rip-off and it lacked heart. I don't know who did the screenwriting for this one, but it was pretty bad. The animations, especially for the weapons were atrocious. The weapons as a whole were pretty bad. I mean, come on... The campaign has the Nazis running around with PPSh-42's! Why? I understand the need to take liberties and that's ok, but they seemed to not care about the campaign much at all and it was probably the biggest disappointment for me. The zombies mode is not even appealing to me anymore. I didn't spend more than 5 mins in the mode since I'm so burned out on zombies. They've introduced some pretty cool stuff with that like class based gameplay for zombies along with objectives - I think. If you're a big zombie enthusiast or you like the COD zombies series, it's probably your bread and butter. I didn't really care either way. And lastly there's multiplayer. This is probably what matters least to me since I was never good at the multiplayer in COD anyways and now with this one it doesn't seem like I can stand for more than 3 seconds without dying, so there's that. I know there have been huge numbers of complaints concerning cheaters, but I'm probably just that bad. So don't come to me for that. I really don't know. The multiplayer on this pc port is like lightning fast and I can't keep up with it cause it's not really my thing. Anywho, I tried to distance myself as far as I could from the COD hate train. Take it or leave it, this is what is probably the unpopular opinion on the game, but I agree with it and I was so disappointed in a game I really looking forward to."

												I would like to address the negative about this game, and my god are there a lot of them. Most of them partake to the multiplayer where I have dumped over 3 days currently.The maps are terrible, especially Gustav Cannon. When you play a map on CoD, you can expect a map with a main chokepoint in the middle and 2 other flanking sides. Most of these maps do this, but they execute them in such a poor manner that it makes me not want to play this game anymore. If you are on Pointe du Hoc in the middle chokepoint, you can get shot from at least 4 places. 4 PLACES! HOW IS THAT FUN? The maps make it impossible for me to just play casual, just run around and get some kills. The weapon balance is above par. Some of them are just overused to the point of annoyance(STG).There are, in my opinion, not enough snipers and shotguns.80% of the players are sweaty nerds. I just like to play a casual game of cod. CoD is known for being casual.I want to like this CoD. I have played many before it and have quite enjoyed myself. This, however, is just no fun for me."

												Too much hacking, too easy to cheat, and laggy matches happens too often.Few maps in the default multiplayer map pool.The launch was fairly good, and not too many problems.. But soon after launch the first aimbotters and wallhackers starts to appear..The devs says they will clamp hard down on cheaters, but immidiately after the announcement... the game had more cheaters then ever.the game has many good elements, and such a potensial but i will not recommend the multiplayer bituntil someone actually gives a damn about cheaters."

												Campaign:Historical inaccuracies: -German soldiers are using Russian weapons on the Western front which makes zero sense at all.  -The game gives you a Lee Enfield rifle as an American soldier in the Battle of the Bulge. -German officers are wearing armbands with the Iron Cross rather than the Swastika.Zombies:Really fun when it doesn't crash. I've lost around 7 hours of gameplay on zombies due to crashing or lagging out. The worst part is that if your game crashes or you lag out, it doesn't save any of your progress for ranking up. I am still only a level 6 after around 9 hours of gameplay.Multiplayer: -Same old unchanged COD but this time without jetpacks.-90% of the time you get killed by a female black soldier in the Wehrmacht which makes no sense at all.I went into this game with really low expectations and I was still disappointed."

This game promised so much, yet only managed to break my tiny fragile heart.General complaints:-Audio design is terrible, and the depth of it is dreadful. For example, A big formation of bombers and escort fighters 50ft above you, are drowned out by the nosie of a gas grenade going off 10 ft away from you, as well as the sond from the planes having no bass at all, just a flat noise that is unreasonably quiet.-They claimed this game was going to be very historically accurate, which it really isn't.-Expensive for being what it is. I am aware that it is a Call of Duty game, but in this case it doesn't justify the pricetag.Campaign: Cons:-Short length, while the level of detail put in to each mission is somewhat high, it's rather short and uninteresting.-Very cliché, the campaign is not imaginative in the slightest, and very predictable.-Russian weapons on the western front whilst weapons like the g43 have been left out entirely.-Extremely frustrating on-rail sections on higher difficulties.-Only one somewhat likeable character.-Pretty samey missions and where they get unique it gets really clunky and unrealistic, and quite frankly, not really interesting.-The inability to select weapons when going into a mission, which has been present in at least one Treyarch title that I know of.-The rate of fire on all of the light machine guns available in the campaign. The Browning m1919 shoots at the rate of a 50.cal, and deals the damage equivilent to a BB gun.-The anti-aircraft guns in the game are single-barreled 20mm flaks with ugly flash hiders/compensators(?), where they could have put in a little variation, or outright replaced them with Flakvierlings or 3,7cm flak guns, which were more likely to be mounted on the vehicles used in game.-No MG tripods, and MG's generally have a very low ammunition capacity.-No Sd.Kfz 222's :(-A lot of unskippable cutscenes and in-game scripted sequences.-Random framedrops, despite having a decent rig and lowering graphics to avoid it.Pros: -You can finally use the sd.kfz 251's mg42 without having to parkour on top of it. (Referring to CoD2)-You can finally pick up MG's that were stationary in previous games.-Nice graphicsMultiplayer: oh where to start. cons:-Extremely hectic.-small maps (except for the war maps) that highly favors shotguns, smg's automatic rifles, and quickscoping.-The majority of the sniper rifles are a one hit kill to the torso, and these rifles (Lee Enfield, Springfield M1903, Karabiner) can't use their ironsights, probably due to the fact they are OHK's, which makes the most common weapons of the war unusable.-The Division system takes attachments, and restricts them to certain classes, which results in the B.A.R and the Fg42 being unable to have bipods, which makes me want to puke. The B.A.R with a bipod is so beautiful, it makes me really happy.  :^(-The Fg42's scope is placed on top of the foregrip, when in actuality, it is located on the magazine well. This also makes me very sad, as it loses a big chunk of its charm. You can also not remove the bayonet if you choose the rifleman division.-A distinct lack of weapons from the singleplayer campaign, such as the M1919 LMG and the revolver from the campaign is not available in multiplayer for some reason, plus the fact that there aren't really many weapons in general.-Toxic playerbase, as per usual, but I just mute chat and all the people by default.-Due to the maps being small, people have a tendency to spawn behind you, specifically when you're using an LMG with a bipod hunkered down somewhere.Pros: -You can acquire loot boxes without actually paying for them, which is alright.Zombie mode:Cons:-Only 1 map (not counting the tiny very uniform prologue map)-Said map has special enemies that cannot be disabled, which can make the game very hectic, and doesn't allow for chill play due to the ever increasing difficulty.-The Bazooka, Panzerschreck, and flamethrower are now unobtainable from the mystery box, and can only be used temporarily if you activate a one-time-use ability that you can only acquire randomly through lootboxes. I really don't like that.-They claimed to have tried to make the zombie mode scarier, and the only scary thing about it is the ridiculously low amount of effort they put in to make it so.-If you join a game in progress you won't get any achievements for the duration of that match, which I noticed after a 4 hour long session beating the hardcore easter egg, where I told them to go ahead and start without me, and I joined on round 2.-No sort of setting for this game mode whatsoever, apart from map selection, which is a shame since it's a PvE game mode, and modifying it as you see fit would be really fun.-Really ugly and generic animated camo applied to your weapon when you Pack-a-punch it. Wish you could disable it somehow.-Certain areas you're forced to be in if you follow the main objectives are very cramped and difficult to navigate in considering zombies pop out from everywhere.-As mentioned above, zombeis pop out everywhere, which triggers a sudden noise. An attempted jumpscare which falls very flat when you get stuck on him and promptly die due to your massive zombie following.Pros: -Something fresh to entertain me for a few hours, and probably more to come once some maps are actually released.-Nice and intricate level design with many puzzles and objectives to figure out-Very gruesome and detailed zombies-Despite being annoying sometimes, the new zombie types do freshen the game up quite a bit.-A zombie mode exclusive multi-shot rocket launcher based on the ""Fliegerfaust"" that was a pleasant surprise when I first obtained it.-I greatly appreciate the sense of progression in the zombie mode now.Summary.If you, ten years from now, during a cozy winter sale when this game is  95% off, want to play a pretty good zombie game, buy this.Note: I could go on bashing even more of the guns and smaller details, but even at the length this review is at right now, I doubt anyone will read it through.Thank you if you did though :^)"

												Theres only one reason I do not reccomend this game...For starters, I had bought the game maybe a month or so after it's initial release. I spent $100.00 on the Digital Deluxe Edition. I had a great deal of fun on the multiplayer and learning the new Nazi-Zombies mode. For about 3 weeks I was unable to play multiplayer or Nazi-Zombies because of Error Code 5.""Error Code 5: Update Failed to download, Restart Required""I had gotten that error for almost a month and it seemed like Activision or Sledgehammer, whoever made the game, idek ffs... they had made no effort to help or fix it until this week's Winter Siege update. Sad. It is a very fun game because its the first ""Boots On Ground"" Call of Duty in 3 years, so I'm going to have fun with it while the community is still alive. Would recommend this game if the developers made more of an effort to fix their game... (BTW, everyone flaming the devs for not getting rid of cheaters/hackers are literally brain-dead. It is hard and sometimes and almost impossible for game devs to stop cheating because there is no real way for them to get rid of cheaters unless they made a custom anti-cheat system, unlike VAC which is ♥♥♥♥ing HORRID. If we would really want to stop cheaters for good, we should follow in the footsteps of Blizzard Entertainment, in their popular game Overwatch, which I'm not a very big fan of, IP Bans cheaters, which means: you cheat, you get your IP Banned from joining any servers and/or playing any other of their games. The only fix to that is if you pay for a new ISP or you move residency... good work Blizzard.)Hope this was helpful y'all. Have a great day/night/afternoon lmao."

												[ZOMBIES]Pros:-Nazi Zombies is fun when playing online or with friends, solo is alright, can get boring after a while, love the atmosphere and the zombie variants.-Optimisation is OK, it's similar to BO3 current optimsation, although there's some issues like explosives drops so much FPS-Love the graphic menu details, they've shown with each options a picture of a graphic setting and how it'll affect the graphics-HDR support (Although can't seem to get it working on my GTX 1080)-Weapon Kit & Different variants of weapon-Eventually someone will come to you and shank you with their shovel (tbh I thought the spade would be a bit bigger...)-Loads map quickly-More levels before you prestige-Able to share points - wait it's jolts-Splitscreen IS NOW ON PC (Latest Patch added split - is more better than BO3 in terms of performance and stability)-Free Nazi Zombies Camo (Didn't pre-ordered the game)Cons:-The textures (Especially the snow) looks undetailed...-Takes REALLY long to level up when you at least level 4 or above-Shovel finisher animation is a bit too long, but I like it, only hoped it was a bit quicker :P-Censored (No Nazi's signs or anything that was related to the nazis)-Weapon's ammo needs rebalancing, they run out too quick-Zombies are similar to IW, the push you as well, sometime they attack you quickly without realising it.-If you have cache sun shadows off then you most likely in splitscreen to crash with an error saying DXGL_DEVICE_Hunng or something like that.[MULTIPLAYERS]Pros:-Has headquarters - looks nice-Get supply drops on specific levels -Supply drops are better in this game you have more better chances of unlocking weapon variant-Removed that annoying boost jump from black ops 3!!! Etc.Cons:-No lie but console version is WAY more polished than this PC port in terms of network/server (4000+ Kbps bandwidth, Nat type is opened) - you’ll get more lags when guns start to fire or when someone is hitting you. Sometimes when you shot a lot of bullets that don’t be registered but other enemies fire registers.-Many cheaters (Reported 1-2 other I couldn’t as I didn’t had the video evidence since I didn’t setup nvidia shadow play)-Delays on registering bullets you fired-Lag spikes (From full signals bars to instant one signal bar - I’ve tested countless times for packet loss but I don’t have any)Overall Summary:Call Of Duty WWII Zombies OR Shall I say Nazis Zombies is actually fun when you have the right players who's willing to co-operate with you and don't leave or open the doors when they have LOADS of jolts, atmosphere of nazi zombies is so thrilling, especially jumpscares, love 'em. They really paid attension with Zombies, plus you can share Jolts (NEW Currency). But overall zombies should be just Treyarch thing as they begin the Zombies - other game devs related to call of duty is just copying the ideas with the few adjustments.In multiplayers I’d say it’s a disaster - soon the devs will realised that their game will die more frequently when there’s cheaters - the player base is already dying - I see why multiplayers are dying... I’m no longer an playing multiplayers - they did do some good things like finally removed that jump boosting etc. But there are some bads that needs to get fixed.Overall Score: 6.5/10"

												I wish that idiots would stop cheating, PERIOD!  Go back to playing minecraft and hack and cheat all you want with your school mates.  Those of us that actually have skills and never in the history of video games have ever cheated, we want to play the game as it is meant to be played.  Currently, this game is unplayable.  No chance when you get aimbotted and the enemy knows exactly where you are and their little friend says, oh he's just good.  Ya ok fool.  We all know the difference between good and cheating.  It really upsets the non cheating community to spend this kind of money on a really nice game, only to find a bunch of hacking and cheating losers.I sent a seriously amazing recommendation to the franchise of COD, it stated:  Anyone caught cheating, hacking or using any software, codes or other ways to enhance their weapons or person tracking that are not included in this game, shall have his/her steam account banned for 6 months.  Second offense, 2-4 years.  All you have to do is look at YouTube and you will see for yourself, punks that are so willing to advertise how good they are at using such cheats.  All over the Internet.So many people have agreed with me that should have been implemented in the loading and log in screen.  of course, those that cheat well you know what they said.  Anyway, this would deter many losers from ever using such a cheat.It's always going to be difficult to stop the non skill people from cheating.  But to post a message like this on the loading screen and to make it visible each and every time you log into the game and to actually follow through with the punishment, then and only then will games be more enjoyable to those of us that never need to use a sissy way to make our game play seem better and to ruin the experience for othersThey devs did such an amazing job with this game. Now will they ever make it so we can play without cheaters....I will not recommend this game until this issue is addressed.https://youtu.be/qkC55fU1m38  One of the many videos out there.  The cheaters have all moved from beta over to the final release."

												It's a shame really, I wanted to like this but it just feels rushed and lacking in content for a AAA title. The campaign is short and forgettable. The multiplayer would be a 7/10 if it weren't for the current issues with rampant cheating and poor matchmaking. The playerbase is rapidly shrinking and it looks to be another case of a CoD that dies in a a few months on PC. Maybe these issues will be dealt with, but I wouldn't hold my breath.The only good things I can think of are the zombies mode and the fact that there aren't currently any pay to win elements in the game (sad that has be a highlight nowadays). Unless you're playing with friends, I can't recommend this title to anyone unless they're just a hardcore fan of the series and have to have it."

												As it stands now, I can't, in good conscience, recommend this game. This is the first CoD I've played since BO2, and while the change of pace is nice, the game is so riddled with issues as of now that it is almost unplayable. Many of these I hope will get worked out in the coming month or so, but basically any time you place in the top 3 players, you get disconnected and the win wasn't tracked. They push Daily/Weekly ""missions"", however if none of my wins are counted, how am I supposed to level up properly?"

												Not so bad. Needs patches. Some guns are abit OP whilst SMG are so lackluster.. Server/hosts are♥♥♥♥♥♥ I've been randomly disconnected too many times. Which means you get no credits towards xp/weapon challenges and in modes like War where it's a fair amount of time being played if you're kicked towards the end of the second half it's very unfair. FPS drops randomly even though I have above minimum requirements. Normally runs 100fps or close enough too but certain maps lucky to get 30 at times. With alot going on it drops often with killstreaks (sometimes below 20) and unable to play with a friend as my fps the whole match is below 30. Game itself is what it is, I never expected it to be realistic in any area so not disappointed with that but this definiately should of been tested better before release as in beta it was fine for me and now there's issues. - Heroic side weapons don't stay equipt in loadsouts, social and prestiege awards do not activiate so you do not currently get them. Some questionable players who seem to have assistance/hacking? However comparing it to Beta where it was ridiculous it's not been too bad. - Games worth getting for a quick shooter and not much more but wait for sale or atleast for a good few patches to sort servers and performance out.EDIT:A few more plays and there's unbalanced teams and too many sniper heavy matches. Some include the broken quick scope which they've not patched on PC(Have on console) and also some with hackers. Leave these games and you will not be awarded your credits but however they will still add a loss to your overall games played. Had to leave the last 5 in a row either due to random FPS loss, questionable activity and poor team balancing."

Although there is a new PAID zombie dlc coming out soon.4) Loot crates and stupid microtransactionsIn my opinion is just another boring, seen it all before pew pew shooter.Buy if you dare."

They're bugged if you have the vsync turned off, which I had because I couldn't stand the mouse lag when it was turned on.COD WW2 campaign feels like a mixed bag, it's neither bad, nor is it good. It's somewhere in the middle, definitely one of the least memorable call of duty campaigns. I wouldn't say that it's as bad as Black Ops 3, but it's most definitely not as good as the old call of duty games. I was really looking forward to this years call of duty game, as Iam a big fan of the advanced warfare campaign, but unfortunately I was a bit disappointed in the overall quality of the campaign.I consider myself a big call of duty fan, but even then I would not recommend this game. If you're getting the game for the campaign solely, don't, you'll be disappointed like me."

												My first review.  Normally not my thing but felt the need to explain to everyone that the online issues everyone is talking about are very real. Iv owned the game since the day it was released. Most the time ill have to exit out to main menu or even desktop a couple times in order for it to find a match. When it does, ill be playing with the same 15 people i see every couple days and are not on my friends list etc. I guess only 15 people play this in my region lol(Denver CO)? Other times it will not find a match at all, for days. Currently i havent been able to join or find a single match in 3 days. Its insane. Would love my money back."

												Multiplayer: Filled with hackers. Only about 5k players on at peak, so you will almost always get the same lobby. Completely not worth the pain and suffering to try and find a good multiplayer match without hackers. Wish I could refund, but already put too much time in.Single Player: Same COD experience that has been recycled for the last 10 years.TL;DR: Not worth $60.... only buy on sale $30 or less. You are lucky to get 15 hours out of this game if you can control your emotions through all the hackers in multiplayer."

												[ZOMBIES]Pros:-Nazi Zombies is fun when playing online or with friends, solo is alright, can get boring after a while, love the atmosphere and the zombie variants.-Optimisation is OK, it's similar to BO3 current optimsation, although there's some issues like explosives drops so much FPS-Love the graphic menu details, they've shown with each options a picture of a graphic setting and how it'll affect the graphics-HDR support (Although can't seem to get it working on my GTX 1080)-Weapon Kit & Different variants of weapon-Eventually someone will come to you and shank you with their shovel (tbh I thought the spade would be a bit bigger...)-Loads map quickly-More levels before you prestige-Able to share points - wait it's jolts-Splitscreen IS NOW ON PC (Latest Patch added split - is more better than BO3 in terms of performance and stability)-Free Nazi Zombies Camo (Didn't pre-ordered the game)Cons:-The textures (Especially the snow) looks undetailed...-Takes REALLY long to level up when you at least level 4 or above-Shovel finisher animation is a bit too long, but I like it, only hoped it was a bit quicker :P-Censored (No Nazi's signs or anything that was related to the nazis)-Weapon's ammo needs rebalancing, they run out too quick-Zombies are similar to IW, the push you as well, sometime they attack you quickly without realising it.-If you have cache sun shadows off then you most likely in splitscreen to crash with an error saying DXGL_DEVICE_Hunng or something like that.[MULTIPLAYERS]Pros:-Has headquarters - looks nice-Get supply drops on specific levels -Supply drops are better in this game you have more better chances of unlocking weapon variant-Removed that annoying boost jump from black ops 3!!! Etc.Cons:-No lie but console version is WAY more polished than this PC port in terms of network/server (4000+ Kbps bandwidth, Nat type is opened) - you’ll get more lags when guns start to fire or when someone is hitting you. Sometimes when you shot a lot of bullets that don’t be registered but other enemies fire registers.-Many cheaters (Reported 1-2 other I couldn’t as I didn’t had the video evidence since I didn’t setup nvidia shadow play)-Delays on registering bullets you fired-Lag spikes (From full signals bars to instant one signal bar - I’ve tested countless times for packet loss but I don’t have any)Overall Summary:Call Of Duty WWII Zombies OR Shall I say Nazis Zombies is actually fun when you have the right players who's willing to co-operate with you and don't leave or open the doors when they have LOADS of jolts, atmosphere of nazi zombies is so thrilling, especially jumpscares, love 'em. They really paid attension with Zombies, plus you can share Jolts (NEW Currency). But overall zombies should be just Treyarch thing as they begin the Zombies - other game devs related to call of duty is just copying the ideas with the few adjustments.In multiplayers I’d say it’s a disaster - soon the devs will realised that their game will die more frequently when there’s cheaters - the player base is already dying - I see why multiplayers are dying... I’m no longer an playing multiplayers - they did do some good things like finally removed that jump boosting etc. But there are some bads that needs to get fixed.Overall Score: 6.5/10"

												Feels like an early access game with a lot of problems, ""servers"" in multiplayer are below par with your average game consisting of you shooting enemies 6+ times only to find yourself dying to that same person that somehow always melts you in 3 hits, as well as constantly dying when you are behind cover or behind a corner. Campaign is average (for me personally, other people might enjoy it alot more).Zombies is great, really fun to play and it is the only part of the game that i would say for me personally is worth playing.Multiplayer is pretty awful at the moment, it has potential to be good if they fix the server issues and bugs that ruin the experience for a lot of people.All in all apart from zombies, this game fails to give me the imperssion of an AAA title game and would only really be worth buying for a lower price."

												Aside from the issues with historical realism (the competitior for a game in this time period at the moment is probably Battlefield, which also bends history to their own needs), the game has a plethora of problems both in it's single player and multiplayer experience. The Singleplayer controls are clunky, and seem to be geared towards a controller scheme rather than a traditional mouse and keyboard (a particular late mission that has you drive a vehicle around is the worst offender of this). Other quick time events, and having to find a particular AI character to get some health, or get some ammo give the game an altogether more aracde feel. Other than that, the single player missions are very meh. Previous Call of Duty games had very memorable campaign missions. Be it Sniping in chernobyl in Call of Duty 4, or Fighting across Favelas in Modern Warfare 2, or crawling through Vietcong tunnels in Black Ops 1. WW2 has no memorable missions, or noteworthy experiences. It's just a bit meh.The Multiplayer experience is much better, but not without it's issues. the common complaints from people are that the maps feel two small, and if you don't use the weapon meta you cant win. Previous COD games felt more fair in weapon choices; where some guns had higher damage they compensated with lower rate of fire. Weapons with great range had a smaller clip, and so on. In Call of Duty WW2 this is no longer the case, and certain weapons have no drawbacks and beat all other weapons in any scenario. This makes you wonder why they even added the other weapons in, and why they didnt just have one Sniper Rifle, one shotgun, one submachine gun, etc.Aside from that, the issues with ""netcode"" and server connection issues are a nuisance. In order to play with my friends I had to port forward a load of internal ports (only Sledgehammer could release a game that basically requires you to remove your firewall to play multiplayer). On top of that, issues such as servers losing connectivity, framerate drops in War mode and the usual community issues including but not limitied to high toxicity from players, cheaters using client side manipulation software/throwaway accounts (banning a player only for them to create an account such as ""omgigotbannedagain"" and reappear before the game has finished), and the soon to be implemented pay to win loot boxes means I have to give this game a negative score."

												I can't really recommend this game, talking about the multiplayer part.The gameplay itself is ok, but there are some issues, that really break it for me.e.g. spawns are really bad: it's possible to be killed by a scorestreak, spawn and then be killed by the same scorestreak again (plane attack run and napalm bomb), happened to me several times.Some of the maps are build in a way that spawn camping (in TDM, which is the mode my friends always want to play) is not only possible but the surest way to victory. It's possible to camp lanes to the main spawnpoint of the other team. If they don't go too near to the spawn, you keep respawning in the same spot and usually get killed if you try leaving the area."

												I know it only says I have 4.6 hours on the game, but I have 108 hours on the Multiplayer of this game, just to clear that out of the water.ANYWAAAAAAAAAY,At the current state this game is in.. multiplayer-wise at least, I really can't recommend this game. I'm fourth prestige and in all my time of playing this game, I've probably played with a hacker 1 out of every 3 games. That's INSANE for a modern AAA title in 2017, and one as big as Call of Duty.The community, as well as myself have done everything in their power to ask Sledgehammer Games for help whether it be thru direct support, twitter, the subreddit, etc. and I have even presented Sledgehamemr with video PROOF of people using aimbots and wallhacks in the game, and then days later ran into the same players, continuing to cheat in the game.The multiplayer isn't fun when you're constantly at a disadvantage trying to fight off a cheater on the other team, or watching someone cheating on your team get 50 kills in domination and the second place player on your team getting 5 kills because he couldn't even find anyone to kill..It's sad, because the base game in my opinion is very fun. The multiplayer is refreshing, the guns feel good (needs some balancing but that's another topic..) and even after prestiging four times I've wanted to come back and play more, but I'm not playing this game or recommending it until the cheater problem is fixed. Sorry Sledgehammer, you've been given more than enough chances to remedy this problem.. as well as completely horrible transparency and updates for the PC version of this game being last priority compared to the console counterparts. I'll change the review as soon as Sledgehammer changes their attitude towards the PC version of this game.EDIT 1/6/18: Just played another game with two cheaters partied up together, still clearly not doing anything to fix the problem. Avoid the game, Treyarch will be announcing their new Call of Duty title in a few months.EDIT 2/10/18: Still meh, wish I didn't buy the season pass."

												I really dont understand how they manage to keep mangling the CoD games. I skipped Infinite Warfare, Ghosts and that other one (Advanced Warfare? Something like that)As much as I love the WWII genre I CANNOT recommend this game to any moderately serious gamer. If you're brand new to playing FPS games, or have less than 100 IQ, then by all means buy the game and have fun. I will be glossing quickly over the problems as I dont feel like wasting more precious time on this review than needed.So many things wrong with this title I'm not sure where to begin, and so I'll just list them as haphazardly as they designed the game:1.) WEAPONSA good portion of the firearms in this game are just plain whacked. Some jump around like crazy when they shouldn't, others don't hardly move at all when they should. M1 Garand fires powerful rounds, yet the muzzle barely kicks when you drop 8 rds out of it in 4 secs. Thompson SMG fired on full auto barely moves around. Other guns like the Waffe 28, another full auto, just spray bullets everywhere. Plenty of other stupid gun mechanics, these are just a few examples.2.)TANK FIGHTYou get to drive a tank on one level for about 3 mins, and the developers put in about that same amount of time and effort into the controls. Without describing them in detail, suffice it to say America would have lost the war if real Sherman tanks handles as poorly. Seriously. It's really bad.3.) LEVELSSome levels are so ridiculously short that I wonder why they even bothered making them their own level at all. I finished one in literally 4 mins. And the first one? Storming Normandy. Apparently all the veterans mis-remembered the distances and dangers on those beaches, if this game is to be believed, because you run no more than 100 simulated feet, blow a hole in the barbed wire with a Bangalore, and you are past the beach. Plenty of other screwy, short and plain stupid levels abound. I think the ultimate stupidest, most unrealistic and downright insulting mission is when your CO decides he's actually a moron, not an officer, and sends you by yourself back into a hotel crawling with enemy troops. After a quicktime event where you fight a German hand to hand and lose all your weapons (for the third time), you find the dumb little civilian girl hiding from her sister inthe basement, and then have to sneakily maneuever your way through half a company of fighting German soldiers while carrying her and unable to do anything else, just to bring her outside to the truckload of other civvies that the US is evacuating because stupidity.4.) RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF BULLET DAMAGEHow many people could still fight effectively if they somehow survived a burst of .45ACP slugs to the face? Or five bursts of high powered rifle rounds to the torso? If you answered with anything more than ""probably none"" then you should disregard this review, purchase the $99.99 version of the game and play it forever. I'm not kidding: So many German soldiers in this game have survived multiple bursts of gunfire to the torso/head only to shake their head, or fall over and get back up just to keep plugging out rounds at you and your squad as if nothing hit them at all. IDK about you, but if I was in a war and survived getting shot in the chest, I certainly wouldn't be drawing any more attention to myself by just back to business as usual with my rifle,5.) AND SO MUCH MORETL;DR Basically this game is one of the most UNrealistic war games I have personally ever played. As stated I love the WWII genre, but this game has none of the REALISM and is more of a surreal fairy tale set in a WWII setting rather than anything else. Zombies mode is pretty good, multiplayer has the usual BS, and that is all the time I feel like devoting to this. Thankfully I have friends who play so I will still get some mileage out of it. NOT RECOMMENDED!!3/10 Overall"

												Cliche, bog standard, glorify america storyline, widespread auto and semi-auto weapons, some of which are completely inappropriate for the setting (such as the SVT-40! WHAT?!). The damn loot crate system that is random and does not reward everyone, the same 'all auto weapons' multiplayer, etc. I could go on but it seems to me that 90% of the budget for development went to graphics, with a storyline just copy-pasted from one of the old manuscripts. The multiplayer is basically BF1, but all infantry only. My advice? Buy BF1. Don't play this POS."

												Even though the multiplayer for WWII is pretty damn great and fun, I simply cannot recommend the game due to the awful server issues that it currently has. Luckily, I didn't have a huge amount of problems prior to the recent patch, but ever since Winter Siege dropped, I'm unable to play a full match without being booted out of the lobby and disconnected from servers. Wait until things like this get fixed. It seems this is happening to a whole load of people and since WWII has been out for over a month, it's just unacceptable that we haven't even heard a single official word about a possible fix."

												Was excited to try a new take on an old series, but this game disappoints. I don't expect that it would be the high-flying 360 space fights of the last few titles, but this is a pendulum swing widely in the opposite direction. Instead of crisp, clean animations and hitboxes, you get clunky reload and body animations. Sprinting lasts about 1.5 seconds, and lots of ""mobility"" animations have extremely long frames (meaning that if you press jump, you are stuck there unable to do anything until you land) compared to other games in the same genre. Aside from the movement qualms I have, the weapons are disgustingly weak. When a player hits 3-4 times, a player expects the enemy to die, however, in this title, unless you are using the ludicrisly overpowered sniper rifles, you need to almost empty an entire clip and HOPE that the game registers the hits. The sniper rifles are excessively overpowered IN COMPARISON to other weapons in terms of stopping power; accuracy not required - elbow shots do the same damage as headshots with every sniper, so just put the x on the body and win.Overall, the maps feel about as good as previous ones, no bettter, no worse.  I was massively disappointed. I expect that anyone who likes to play competitively will feel likewise."

												Campaign: (I player on Hardcord)Allies are useless except for their ""Ubilities"". They can't even be used for bullet shields, bullets pass through.Cover is like paper, unless you're a enemy where it is like adamantium.Most deaths occur from allies blocking your bullets, random terrain kills (Falling planes, bells, rocks), dogs jumping on you as you are either; surrond and continously surronded by other dogs or grenades which are unreturnable as the dog kill timer exceeds the grenade fuse and other BS like that.Story is pretty tame, not much interesting things occur except for the fore-mentioned terrain kills. Would have really liked to see more variety in missions and better controls all round. Leaning is very silly as in multiplayer you have to set the keys whereas in campaign you have to look around a corner to have the chance you will decide to lean.Grenade indicators are pretty bad with my teammates usually throwing the grenades in my direction. Obviously they realised the AI couldnt understand how to do otherwise so they made them not able to damage you but its bloody scary when a random grenade indicator is at your feet, either pick the grenade up and explode or run out of your cover into death.MGs are♥♥♥♥♥♥annoying, usually headglitching or just shooting you through cover.Tank missions are horrendous, controls are silly but let me give you a quick rundown:WASD works from the way you (The turret) are facing, not where the tank body is like any other game, this leads you to be unable to see most of the time wtf is happening and you are having to aim away from hostiles to just move.Rating 4/10 Couldnt think of a worse COD campaignMultiplayer:Balancing is out the window.Was the word even invented in this WW2 timeline?The games server choice for good connection is in last priority with getting into a game as fast as possible, usually leaving most of the game red barred (And they dont even show ping counter)Cant wait for the already OP guns to become PTW, as we all know it will.That one train map is horrid, frames ans ping DIES on such a map.

												Where do I even start? Campaign: A very short repetitive campaign that took me about 4-5 hours to complete the first time around. The characters were very forgettable, I only remembered Zussman because they said his name every 2 minutes for the entire campaign. The vehicle controls are horrendous and clunky and should not have been included at all if they can't take the time to make a decent control system. The stealth portions felt pointless because if you messed up, going guns blazing took less time and was easier than the stealth.Multiplayer: This is the reason I truly dislike this game. I don't even know where to start. The hitboxes are horrendous and spotty at best. Sometimes they're ok, but for the most part they're way off. I feel like I'd be better off trying NOT to hit them. In my last 6 days playing this game, I haven't been able to complete a match, wether it crashes 1 second into the game or 5 minutes. CONSTANT CRASHES EVERY GAME. There are several guns that are extremely overpowered, and if you play one match you'll find out exactly which guns they are. The snipers have no sway and are slightly overpowered. A sniper shouldn't beat a shotgun with incendiary rounds in a trench fight. There are a few maps that punish anybody for not camping and on those maps the games are achingly slow because everybody picks a corner and thus the game moves at a snail pace.Headquarters: The headquarters is a redeeming feature for this game. It's very helpful to learn new weapons and scorestreaks. The inclusion of missions to earn yourself extra rewards, and contracts for a risk reward is great. It's cool to be able to see what other players get from supply drops as well as other people seeing yours. The player to player interaction outside of a match is very welcomed. Tho alot of my supply drops and mail have been eaten by the game and disapear without granting me my rewards. Which truly sucks to work so hard for something only to have it taken from you by the game right as you finally achieve it. Side notes: Every time I open the game it tells me to update the game drive or exit the game. If I choose to update it, I can't use my mouse to select any of the options and only my ""enter"" button and the number pad will work. Which gets pretty annoying considering I have updated it well over 15 times now. And when switching between multiplayer to campaign or nazi zombies, it gives me an error code and I have to select for it to bypass this code. Which gets extremely frustrating. This game needs A LOT of work before I will play it again. Do I regret spending all the money I did on this game? Yes, yes I do."

												Update on my last review of the MP of CoDWWII:After 1 month the game a has stil made very little progress. At this moment following things are brocken:- spawn point still do not work, you get trapped with the enemy litteraly next to you and the spawn point do not swap, even after one month this still happens.- banning cheaters seems to much of an effort and the numbers are increasing.- gun balancing is still completely off. All they have done is to change the sound of a few weapons and add new ones.-the map design is plain and simply bad, with some exceptions but as most of them are its a simple run towards the enemy spawn and trap them inside.-the latest patch which was btw 12.3 GB large has only added new uniforms, a new gun for each division and a version of Carentean in winter. Otherwise the patch has increased the loading time of the maps drasticaly and the overall server performance has dropped.It is unbelievable that Sledgehammer Games is still not capable of fixing their own game."

												This game is basially a 1940s version of Infinite Warfare. It might be good if you like the last cod, but if you didnt like infinite warfare, I do not think you would like this.You take about 2-3 hours to finish missions, and the multiplayer mode is just not impressive.I liked Call of Duty, but the inifinite warfare has already disappointed me, and this one is still disappointing."

												******Scam Warning**** - (REFUNDED)-local multi player = (NO)-local co-op = (NO)This game has no split screen.... Thanks for lieing to me steam only reason I purchased it was to play coop and zombies split screen but. Aparntly my $6k pc can't handle it....  so blizactivision had to remove it from the inferior pc platform.Worst♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever played in my life... it's like cod form 10 years ago with every feature removed smashed with a hammer and reassembled by a groupe of blind soccer moms.-no leaning..... (console port too many buttons for a controller)-wall hacks.... (????why?????)-tiny maps..... (literially feels like an onrails shooter)-unlockables..... (no substance so better throw in some grind for the life donkeys)-the menu system is so bad and poorly laid out and buggy it will make you question if anyone actually tried to play this game.....................................(ZERO E-sports/competetive future)......................................Go play cod 1 and 2 they are significantly better then this absolute flaming trash heap of a game... Those of you who have not played COD 1-2, they are some of the best (PC) games ever made. Call Of Duty WWII is actually depressing when compared side by side, HUGE strides backwards in gameplay, with a foccous on a census group of soccer moms getting confused over what the A button does.Played for 10 minutes then realized there was walll hacks built in, at which point I immediately did what any self respecting veteran gammer would do and mashed alt F4 followed by a snap uninstalled.... I played cod 1 and 2 professionally back in the day... really ♥♥♥♥ing sad the state of games these days. This is nothing more than a console port onrails shooter for 6-12 year olds, no wonder they removed the swastikas... nothing is more offensive than seeing one while ""slaughtering"" the oposition.Do I want to pay $130.00 canadian for zombies.... no, that's ♥♥♥♥ing criminal...Someone needs to stop the endoctrantion of children into absolutely dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ dumbed down micky mouse video games... it's a form of child abbuse.(ITS NOT THE OPTOMIZATION THAT MAKES THIS GAME BAD!

												~~~~MY REVIEW IS REFERRING TO THE MULTIPLAYER MODE, NOT THE CAMPAIGN~~~~Let me start off by saying that I've given this game a lot of thought, and only through a lot of convincing from my friends, did I actually decide to purchase it. I figured with all the hype around this particular Call Of Duty, I'd take a chance on it.Good lord was I wrong, deciding to buy this game. The game has a plethora of issues that need to be fixed becuase the game is simply unplayable with them. For starters, the servers are absolute trash, I keep getting random freezes whenever I am in a fire fight with someone, or random times with a lot of lag. Also, shouldn't a ♥♥♥♥ing shotgun kill someone with one shot at close range to the chest? This game needs work, I regret ever making this purchase.I really thought I'd give Call Of Duty games a chance, especially with this one, but it is ridden with hackers and server issues, therefore, I DO NOT recommend this game, save your money and buy a game that is actually meaningful."

												The campaign is okay, but nothing close to CoD: World at War.  For the most part it's extremely predictable but I like it just due to the setting.Multiplayer is a joke, player movement is somewhere inbetween uncanny valley and molasses.  But if you like to collect stickers and have a scrapbook this is the game for you.  I don't understand or care for some pistol skin that nobody will see and don't care if I see it either.  Collect all eighty five of them!Up to 48 players in the ""social club"" zone but only 6v6 in a real battle.  Glad to see this series is stuck in the last century.And the 13 year old player base is completely evident in chat.  You'll find out things you never knew about your mom and your own sexuality.  That must be a bonus.  Wasted $60 bucks just because I love WW2 games."

												5 crashes on the first mission, game just simply closed itself and no error report or anything. Feels more like playing a Kickstarter Early Access game than a AAA-title, and sadly it does not live up to the glory that was COD 1 & 2.Atleast it's fairly pretty to look at.Edit:3 more crashes during the second mission, still not done with it."

												Disappointing. The expectation for this game was so great, however the result was so tragic.I'll start by saying that the game has far too many technical problems. For one I couldn't play it for about 2 weeks after release due to the game constantly crashing on launch. Then an update came out which allowed me to launch the game but then crashed after around 30 minutes of game time. I submitted a ticket to the support team and I still haven't got a reply and I submitted the ticket in early December. The game suffers from loading screens that take too long to load as well as looking dull at the same time. I had to play the game on a friends PC so I could get a feel for it, as it would not run at all on my PC, I've tried everything to fix the problem and it's gotten me nowhere, the community have said the same thing when I've asked them for help and the developers never replied to my ticket. I'll now move on to the multiplayer. The actual gameplay is good, the guns feel nice to shoot, getting a kill feels oddly satisfying, the mechanics are great and it strives for non stop, fast gameplay, a classic Call Of Duty trademark, however that's the only thing I have to say about the multiplayer. The maps are flat, generic and boring, far too small and you feel like your always trapped in a corner, or surrounded. Each map is layed out in the same way; three ways to go forward, to the left, right or down the middle. The way that the maps are designed give you little room to maneuver and few options to evade an attack, perform a flank, or pursue an enemy. There are far too many areas of cover that are surrounded by invisible walls; cars, trucks and other varieties of cover dotted around the maps have invisible walls surrounding them, making it impossible to jump on top of them or jump over them, this takes away options for the player when engaging/evading other players. The perimeter of the maps are just invisible walls that don't have any visible walls or fences that stop you from exiting the map area, I am constantly bumping into these invisible walls as a result. Gameplay suffers as a consequence of this, I said above that the game has good mechanics, and I stand by that claim, but if the maps are lacking, then the gameplay is going to lack as well. Micro transactions, it seems that every game developer is obsessed with these. I can see why they'd want to use them, it makes them money, nothing wrong with that, it's the way that they are constantly ramming them down your throat. In the headquarters there are dozens of tasks for you to open supply crates, watch others open them and complete other tasks to gain more crates. At the end of each match on every mode you can see who has got a crate. This I feel entices people to spend money on these useless crates. The items you get are all pretty much the same, useless crap. All the grips look the same and the emotes look so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I just had to laugh. You never know what gun the attachment is for because it doesn't say on the card when you unbox it. There's nothing to gain from opening the crates, the gun skins are laughable, I'm not talking about the design, I'm talking about the fact that they are applied to the handle of your gun, the part where your character's hand is holding it, covering it, so you can't see it. This goes for the zombie crates as well. The zombies is also a let down in my view. I was expecting an intense mode with well designed maps, various guns scattered around the map for you to purchase that are actually useful, and a mystery box which gives you the same sense of anticipation and excitement as you find out what gun you got. This just isn't the case with this game. The maps are like the multiplayer maps; flat, generic and boring, the mystery box is as exciting to use as toilet roll and the guns don't feel as useful and effective as they were in previous games. I was expecting a simple concept of guns, zombies and map designs that support team play and strategy over solo plays in place of all the laser guns and double jumps etc you got in the last few installments. Instead what we got was yet more futuristic laser guns and various other things that make no sense, that's not what nazi zombies was meant to be like, it was never like that in the days of World At War and the first Black Ops. Also in the older games, you always knew when a new wave was starting, or when you gained an ability such as insta kill etc by the sounds made by the game when something happened. In WWII it's on the opposite end of the scale, the lot of it is anticlimactic and dull, you never get the sense of fear when a new wave was starting or a sense of anticipation when you gain an ability. The zombies mode is also littered with a useless cutomization menu which over complicates the concept of zombies. The funny part is that the customization in zombies gives you more options than the multiplayer. What happened to the time when you just started the game and tried to survive for a while? This is just a let down on every level. The user interface is overly complicated and not user friendly. The whole thing is littered with far too many sub menus that are disorganised and a pain to navigate through. The loading screens are filled with a large image of the games logo, they must be trying to remind me of what game I'm playing after I wake up from being bored to sleep. The campaign is actually the best part of the game, but it too doesn't come without flaws, don't worry I won't reveal any spoilers so you're safe to read on. The cut scenes and cinematics are very impressive, the characters look life like however the movements look a tad too robotic. This game would be better as a movie, I would rather watch 2 hours of cinematics than spend 2 hours playing it. The story is good, although not great, the game doesn't go into much detail, it gives you a general outlook on the war. The various sights and sounds don't seem anything war like, there is too much censorship implemented, you don't get the feel of the horrific acts that took place in many different places throughout the war. There is no obsenity or anything that makes you feel like your involved in the story, it's just too generic. The actual missions themselves don't excite me, they seem simple and linear, plagued by invisible walls that are constantly cutting off various paths, this goes for when you're in a tank also, the paths you can take are limited. I shall refer back to the older titles and say that there is much more room for maneuver and more options for you to choose from. Also the campaign only tells the story of the American's perspective, I would've liked to have seen how the story unfolded on the British, French and even the axis side, this would give the player a much deeper understanding of how the war unfolded. The campaign does have some nice characters and dialog to go along with the impressive cinematics, and there are a few nice touches like your squad mates being able to give you abilities and throw you ammo and health packs etc, but that's all the positive feedback I can give. To conclude Call Of Duty WWII gives players a boots on the ground type of experience. However it is plagued by constant technical problems, poor map design, an overly aggresive micro transaction system, a lack of customization, overly complicated zombies mode, unfriendly user interface and a handful of other annoying niggly aspects. It is over priced and the DLC's are bigger rip offs than the thousands of micro transactions you can buy in game. Sledgehammer games did a really poor job in making this game and it shows. I was really looking forward to this game, a classic boots on the ground fast paced action shooter was why I bought COD back in the WAW & Black Ops days. However this installment is such a let down. I regret buying it and I urge people to save their money. This game released on November 3rd and I was back to playing Battlefield 1 by early December."

												I already put a few hours into this game, so heres my honest review.Before i get started let me say my PC specs:GTX 1080tii7 7700k16gb RAM144Hz monitor 1ms reqThis is all in MY OPINION. Last CoD i liked before WWII was Ghosts. Now its WWII. Boots.. On.. The.. Ground! <3General - Pretty good, sounds, artwork, design, gameplay, historic accuracy (if you actually care for that, but its a video game ffs) if i had to rate the overall as of release date- i would say 6/10.Why 6/10? To many cons.. to many.Pros: Scenery is amazing! Sounds are very explosive, distinguished, loud! I love it! Artwork is amazing, i would describe it was jaw dropping- unlike the last few CoD's where the artwork looked like they hired a child to just scribble some bright colors. The story is very touching, a personal kind of feeling, you get very close to the characters, and tbh- theres been once where i had a tear drop just because on how close i personally felt, as a gamer, to the in game character. Zombies is AMAZING! It has that WaW feeling, that NAZI ZOMBIES feeling! No damn zombies flying in exo suits, dressed in f**king costumes with a wig and overalls.. no. Flesh eating, flesh torn, blood sucking, hand slapping, hand jer--- i think you get the point. I spent 4 hours in a zombies game with a group of randomes, all had mics, all were skilled. Got to round 44 before we finally wiped. All of us had 2k+ headshots, less than 6 downs, 1k+ kills (let me explain the HS and kills- i THINK headshots are counted seperate froms kills, because we all had less kills than we did headshots.. its weird)and a jack load of money! By far, one of my favorite zombies already.Multiplayer... lmfao. What even is it? If i could describe the multiplayer in 1 word, i would choose.. depressing. Its so laggy, unbalanced, guns kill WAY to fast- and in beta they killed pretty slow which felt good.. why did they change it SO much? Why? Idk the answer to this. I hate the multiplayer so far- its just.. down right garbage. However, this is a pro because it brings back that WaW type style, not so fast paced, not so slow paced.. just right- and i love that a lot! Large variety of guns, and the divison system is awesome!Cons:Honestly, pretty much just the multiplayer, and sadly a pretty short single player. I had to stop myself after the 4th mission because im just doing them to fast, and im playing on hardened. I have a love-hate relationship for the squad system in the single player as well- not the biggest fan of it- personally.Zombies is a little laggy, might be on my end, but im not sure- but that lag can mean the difference between life or death.Pretty short story- MAYBE only 8ish or so hours of story if you grind it out in one going, like i about did. Horrible PC optimalzation, very bad- one of the worst game ports i have ever seen tbh. They could have done a better job.. but keep in mind of the developer...Sledgehammer. NOT TreyArch... sadly.Overall, again as of day 01.. 03/10/17' this game is honestly not worth the $60 as of right now, unless you purely want it for story and zombies, but multiplayer needs some MAJOR changes.. MAJOR. As of right now- i will have to downrate this game as well.If you have any questions feel free to ask- ill give you again... MY OPINION, and mine only."

												***UPDATE*** If I could give this pile of crap worse than a negative rating, I would.  Worst game I've ever had the displeasure of wasting money on.Steam may say I only have ~2 hours in COD WWII, that's my campaign time.  I have 26 hours in multiplayer according to Steam at the time of writing.-- The Bad --Not even close to being worth the money.The weapons deal realistic damage but they didn't make the maps big enough to compensate for that so SMG's and Rifles are stupid OP, like cross-map sniper killer OP.Speaking of weapon damage, the shotgun damage is practically non-existent unless you equip incindiary rounds which are handy to get you lots of From the Grave medals as the damage takes too long to be effective against the afforementioned OP SMGs and Rifles.Hitboxes are non-existent irritatingly frequently so shooting straight through someone with an M1903 is a common occurrence.I think I'm yet to go for a whole game without a death to someone who spawned right behind me or who I spawned in front of.  The spawns are so bad I've literally spawned in between four enemies.The game seems more like beta quality than ready for release, one example being you have to click the camo button at least three times to make it work (this is reproducable after every game).  I get the game is new, but Steam Greenlight games have an argument here, AAA titles that charge AAA prices don't.  On that topic, the servers were down for hours on launch day.SledgeHammer Games apparently thought it would be a good idea to build camping sites into the maps to help all the people that don't like to move so there are mounted MG42 HMGs in great spots to control half of the already tiny map.The ability of players to run is akin to that of someone with accute asthma in a field of pollen and regaining stamina is just as bad.Plus all the usual CoD BS such as jumping when turning a corner and lying on the ground whilst being shot at point blank range being valid strategies.-- The Good --The weapon sounds are awesome and from what I've played so far, the campaign is very good.  The automatic map callouts of enemy locations are a nice touch.  The game looks cool, even at medium settings and the Headquarters social area is nicely done (though, a confirmation to go there would be nice as the load times are not fun).-- Final Point --Tried to get a refund but sadly had played too many hours (I actually forgot refunds were possible through Steam until it was too late).  If you're on the fence, don't buy this - at least until they release some patches to fix all the brokenness.  If your money is burning a hole in your pocket, check out Black Ops III."

												I was trying 5 times to post my negative review, I spoke a lot about pros and cons, but apparently I am using some certain words, that are now banned in this particular game review.So it just comes to this - good looking game, but overpriced, destroyed by community, PC and SJW and no its not ""personal computer shortcut"".(maybe I can post full review on edit?)-----Honestly I don't know how to properly express my feelings about this game and I want to mention this CoD taught me a valuable lesson, but this will come later.There are so many things I would like to point. Maybe to start with: I stopped buying CoD's since they started to get mixed to negative user reviews, but the story behind it was also my personal worse and worse multiplayer experience before that. Since BlackOps for instance and their ""record every game"" policy, which made increadible in-game lags, proven inconsistency between client and server (you could think you aim at player, but in reality you shoot slightly behind him).Nevermind the past, I decided to buy this CoD due to this returning to the roots, the World War 2 climate and stuff.Maybe let's go on with pros:I do really like it. The campaign, the heroes, the protagonist, brotherhood, bravery, honor, mentioned war-hero problems: civilians or orders, sergeant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his complicated past, liutenant goodguy, BFF soldier ♥ with medkits ♥. The graphics! This game looks really beautiful, and the cutscenes - really as I was experiencing magnificent movie like ""Saving private Ryan"".The gameplay man - no matter what it's still THE call of duty game, I love this fast-paced multiplayer and the tons of killstreak rewards!And again the Zombies, although I can only approve them commonly, since I am only causal zombie-mode survivor....well and that's it. There is other side of the medal:Campaign is short... Intense. But short. Those 17 hrs on record (at the time) were: veteran completition, re-run regular, missed achievements and those dumb 33/33 findings. Occasionally I experience short, but insane fps drops (usually in beginning of mission and 1-2 times in-progress when friendly character makes a speech how screwd we are in the battlefield).As it comes to multiplayer, again:you have to face the most stupid, spoiled, cheated, childlish community. If you perform too bad = face your team ""cant do much more, look this guy *name* 3/17 hahah"", if you are too good = ""*name* hacker, go kill yourself, get cancer etc."" oh and who can forget infamous ""i f%ck your mom"", on top on flaming with virgins and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sizes (+++ for devs!!! you can disable chat finally!!!)the matchmaking in multi makes it overwhelmed with cheaters and DO mention only the visible one fullautoaim. I can only imagine how much soft things are in there: aiming supports, wallhacks, radarhacks, no recoils...and the usuall stuff to complain about multiplayer, see... this really bothers me, there are tons of snipers there. They only need 1 shot to kill you. And by 1 shot I mean 0.5 shot. Like shot in a leg through metal obstacle. Even from my very own experience I have to say something is really fishy about sniping and quickscoping in this particual game. I could swear on my very own life I already killed somebody with 'karbine?' by HEADSHOTting him directly into a stomach and killing somebody by sniping a wall 1 meter behind him... yeah.I'd like to state some negativity about the zombies, but again I'm only casual so I can't. I just like old-school zombies, normal zombies, normal zombie movies - slow walking dead to running HUMAN corpses. All this new information around - boosters, traps, fancy alien-upgrade weaponing, mutants, duozombie with bombs(?) ...its just too much for a casual like me.And finally (oh I hope I won't get banned for this)... we come to the final boss of cons of CoD WW2:The Political Correctness aka PC and his little fairies Social Justice Warriors aka SJW.This was just too much on top of all negative ""little"" things I mentioned earlier. I cannot wear to words how it ruins my immersive experience fighting alongside female characters in a WARGAME simulator. No, just no. You may argue now - ""fu gecko, its 2k17 and i drink starbucks glutenfree coffee now, we are way past female-oriented brutality in movies and gaming - what about females in LoL, Dota, MortalKombat or PUBG you racist and sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?!?!?!""... OK, but first 3 aren't war simulators, in PUBG you pick female thinking you'll have smaller character, to avoid bullets better (she is not smaller) and after all you end up watching her butt alltime in 3rd person... but there is 1 small thing there is in new CoD and isnt in PUBG: the devs put cosmetic death character animation here: DYING IN INCREADIBLY PAINFULL AGONY FEMALE SOLDIER ON B POINT BLEEDING OUT AND SCREAMING TO HELLS AND HEAVENS BECAUSE HER F***ING LEGS WERE TORN APART BY F***ING ARTILLERY BARAGE and SAME CRYING POOR FEMALE SOLDIER IN PAIN WHEN DYING FROM F***ING FLAMETHROWES FIRE... no, just no... really, who thought it was good idea? All of that on top of being still a WORLD WAR 2 game??And when we already talk about immersion I want to quote some random chinese wisdom in random online meme I've read: ""Call of Duty: World War II, because nothing is as immersive as playing black female paratrooper fighting on western front in Europe during WW2 on Axis side""....yeah the PC and SJW army you get it: females dying in terrible and painful death in war-game simulator = no problemo, but oups we have to censor all swastika in multiplayer (yes they really DID censor it!)... well devs aren't even pretending their multiplayer is actually PEGI 7+I just cant force myself out of ""Not recommended"" vote here. I remember on top of all negativity I pointed, this game costs 60€€€€ with possibility to grab S-Pass for another 50€€€€ (...aaaaand its still region based - EU only, as they stated). For that price they could at least give up on all this PC-SJW stuff and focus at least on longer campaign. Oh yeah I didn't mention that - PC-SJW is still present in singleplayer, much less though.Do I feel screwed by Activision? No. I will still enjoy the game. Good single campaign, multi mechanics. I am a CoD fanboi afterall. As a conclusion we come to the valuable lesson learned: Will never ever buy any more Call of Duty unless of course user review exceeds 90%, then maybe we can think about it."

												Real quick...The Good:1) WW2 Atmosphere (maps, weapons, characters, scorestreaks etc)2) Divisions add a nice little twist which is somewhat refreshing3) No aim-assistance nonsenseThe Bad:1) HORRIBLE linear map layouts lead to a campfest with little to no ability to flank.2) Espionage ""Basic Training"" gives the enemy team a constant radar on you for approximately 5 seconds (after you've been hurt or stunned). Why not just put Awareness or Amplify in the game then?Long story short, the maps have got to be some of the worst I've ever seen in a CoD game at launch before (Flak Tower, USS Texas, Gustav Canyon and Aachen are all complete trash). Spawns rarely flip in TDM because the maps allow for excellent camping spots and thus, if you're someone who flanks often and likes to surprise the enemy in their spawn, you won't get there often enough to have good success. CoD maps always offer three lanes on each map. However, the poor layouts really negate most of them. Such a shame.I'd recommend the game if you're dying to play a new CoD. For sure, the game delivers that nostalgic CoD experience and at times can be pretty enjoyable. But it's not fully my cup of tea."

												Finished Call of Duty WWII.I...have some thoughts.While I was glad to return to the era that had launched the series originally, I was sorely disappointed by the dramatic drop in atmosphere and immersion. I'm not just talking about the authenticity, but the actual quality of the game. Yeah, the graphics are pretty, but it doesn't make me really believe I'm storming Omaha or crossing the Rhine, especially if I feel like I'm watching a war movie from the 70s with a miss-mash of surplus and copious amounts of brass being spent on shoot outs. Allow me to illustrate my point with the last entry of the Call of Duty series that was set in WW2- World at War (WaW). It wasn't just the design and the authenticity that sold the game play- it was the realism. You shoot a Nazi in the chest and he goes down. In the latest offering, I found myself reloading a 30-round magazine after emptying half of the nearly dime-sized rounds of a Sturmgewehr into the upper body cavity of a kraut wearing Swedish wool (to the uninitiated, a more blueish color than the field gray typically seen on Germans.)   Indeed, the last mission I witnessed one stubborn actor take most of my magazine, stumble a bit, right himself up, and only go down as I drilled him in the head. I guess I didn't realize zombie mode was also in the main story.Indeed, while some can say 'get over it, its a game,' and I would normally agree, I counter with 'it's a game that is selling itself as history to people who know better.' We get sold a game that shows lazily modeled Jeeps with one side modeled and mirrored, a Sargent that is more Pirate-y than the average Airborne at a Reenactment, and Buddy Holly as a tourist in the ETO. If I wanted to have the same experience, I'd spend less time watching Big Red One or Kelly's Heroes. What hurts the most is that I -know- it can be done. The first Call of Duty brought realism to the WW2 shooter in the first place, and managed to do it two more consecutive times in a row.//EDITI'd also like to add that the controls are very clunky. I found myself fumbling to use one of the 5 different action buttons to either change weapons, enable a special weapon, throw back a grenade, use special equipment, or have one of the annoying squadmembers finally shut up about taking a health kit or ammo from them. There are a few vehicle sequences- a Jeep ride that keeps your POV straight ahead at speeds beyond that of a 1940s vehicle, a tank section that turns the chasis of the tank to where the turret is ('oh you're looking at that King Tiger? you must want to drive right towards it, right?!'), and a dog fight section in a P-40 that I found myself spending more time clumsily flying into friendly bombers than chasing Messerschmits.Gameplay was also very annoying. For the sake of going through the story, I played through on the medium difficulty, and still found myself healing every couple of minutes. No, not because I stood in the open, but found the combat to be somewhat unbalanced. As stated, I'd reload magazines after downing a Kraut, but would nearly get killed by a burst from every single one on the field at the moment. Many combat situations require sprinting from sparse cover to cover. Now, I've beaten all the aforementioned WW2-set CoDs on Veteran difficulties, so I know how to play the WW2 shooter game. It was as difficult as some of the previous titles set to Hardened or Veteran in places. A major detriment to the game play experience is the 30+ second animation for healing that takes up valuable time to either return fire or sprint to cover. In addition, being told every other minute that I've got ammo, medkits, grenades, or any other combat feature is very annoying. I get it- youve got ____ for me, I'll keep that in mind for when the game doesn't have 3 med kits laying around or an ammo dump to resupply from. //EDIT In the end, I'd personally rate my experience at 4/10. I spent 8 hours playing a WWII shooter that has less WWII in it than the 28 hours I've spent in Wolfenstein II, and that's set in an alternate timeline 1960's."

												i have always played call of duty since the first console release on xbox, call of duty finest hour. i have stuck with the series through all the futuristic garbage hoping it would go back to modern or ww2 setting. it finally has but this is not at all what i wanted.first is the fact that 5 minutes into the campaign and the social justice warrior lines start with your character saying the sergeant has enough bigotry for all of us. then when you are invading normandy the germans are using ppsh-41 for some reason.second is the multiplayer. it is terrible. the lag is inbearable and the movement feels so off. i cant figure it out but it doesnt feel right. using the first gun for the infantry division its just hit markers all day. not sure if its the lag or if the gun is that weak but youre lucky to get one kill with it. picked up another gun someone dropped, stg-44, and went to town on people. the other problem is the sound of women dieing. there shouldnt be any women fighting in ww2. there were a few french resistance fighters and a few russian women. thats it. the constant cries of women completely ruins immersion. seeing a black female nazi makes no sense at all. in a modern setting they can do that since we let women fight on the front lines now and all races are equal today. but not in ww2. it implies that its always been great for them.the social justice politically correct stupidity is fully fleshed out in this game and it seems they should have spent that time on making the game play better instead.i have taken advantage of the steam refund to get my money back for this abortion of a game."

Sledgehammer, why not implement some sort of votekick option at the very least? I mean, you seriously think that we believe that you can't do that in an update? lol... come on.

												So apparently cod ww2 multiplayer isnt part of this game so i need to download the campaign, play for 5mins just to leave this review HAHAHAHA. Anyway for the multiplayer (which I shouldn’t need to tell you is the reason why most people buy this game) still needs to be in beta for these 19 reasons:1. Half of the emotes are the same for some reason2. spawns are horrible as usual3. you cant edit your settings or leave a game during killcam, or inbetween switching sides. If you are editing your settings and a killcam/end of round commences the interface is force closed and you are forced to watch the cutscene/killcam4. the same audio glitches that were present during the beta have yet to be fixed5. fov resets, which has been a problem for multiple previous cod’s that ive played, I have no idea how this hasn’t been fixed6. no pc/steam frendly mechanics im prettysure black ops had atleast an option to display fps7. servers are crap8. there are only about 15 player emblems9. bad character customization interface, for example,  navigation through character cosmetics, division customization, and playercards  should all be in one interface not 3 seperate ones 10. bad lobby interface, for example you need to hit a hotkey to view/skip the next map every time11. there’s still a hacker problem12. have yet to receive 2 preorder bonus's (zombie camo and 1100 points)13. mouse lag, mouse movement feels like im moving in mud14. no option to report someone ingame or ability to view someone's steam profile from ingame15. weapon name/attachments of gun should be displayed while spectating16. loading screens went from 30 seconds at day of launch to 2 mins out of nowhere without any settings being changed and I have no idea how to fix this, im assuming it’s the servers17. spectating for 20seconds at the start of every game mode18. for some reason selecting a class has a loading screen so you cant even see what you’re  selecting until 20seconds of being in game, i have never played a cod where classes had loading screens why this was added baffles me19. multiplayer and singleplayer  are separate and you cant leave a review for the game unless you have 5mins of campaign gameplay, yet the reviews  for multiplayer and single player are not separateThis game feels like mw2 with a skin, less features and more glitches. With all these reasons I wouldn’t buy this game, and considering they think this game is in good condition to release its safe to assume that most of these issues wont be fixed. They got their money, that’s  all they care about and I wont make this mistake again."

												Real quick...The Good:1) WW2 Atmosphere (maps, weapons, characters, scorestreaks etc)2) Divisions add a nice little twist which is somewhat refreshing3) No aim-assistance nonsenseThe Bad:1) HORRIBLE linear map layouts lead to a campfest with little to no ability to flank.2) Espionage ""Basic Training"" gives the enemy team a constant radar on you for approximately 5 seconds (after you've been hurt or stunned). Why not just put Awareness or Amplify in the game then?Long story short, the maps have got to be some of the worst I've ever seen in a CoD game at launch before (Flak Tower, USS Texas, Gustav Canyon and Aachen are all complete trash). Spawns rarely flip in TDM because the maps allow for excellent camping spots and thus, if you're someone who flanks often and likes to surprise the enemy in their spawn, you won't get there often enough to have good success. CoD maps always offer three lanes on each map. However, the poor layouts really negate most of them. Such a shame.I'd recommend the game if you're dying to play a new CoD. For sure, the game delivers that nostalgic CoD experience and at times can be pretty enjoyable. But it's not fully my cup of tea."

												I was trying 5 times to post my negative review, I spoke a lot about pros and cons, but apparently I am using some certain words, that are now banned in this particular game review.So it just comes to this - good looking game, but overpriced, destroyed by community, PC and SJW and no its not ""personal computer shortcut"".(maybe I can post full review on edit?)-----Honestly I don't know how to properly express my feelings about this game and I want to mention this CoD taught me a valuable lesson, but this will come later.There are so many things I would like to point. Maybe to start with: I stopped buying CoD's since they started to get mixed to negative user reviews, but the story behind it was also my personal worse and worse multiplayer experience before that. Since BlackOps for instance and their ""record every game"" policy, which made increadible in-game lags, proven inconsistency between client and server (you could think you aim at player, but in reality you shoot slightly behind him).Nevermind the past, I decided to buy this CoD due to this returning to the roots, the World War 2 climate and stuff.Maybe let's go on with pros:I do really like it. The campaign, the heroes, the protagonist, brotherhood, bravery, honor, mentioned war-hero problems: civilians or orders, sergeant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his complicated past, liutenant goodguy, BFF soldier ♥ with medkits ♥. The graphics! This game looks really beautiful, and the cutscenes - really as I was experiencing magnificent movie like ""Saving private Ryan"".The gameplay man - no matter what it's still THE call of duty game, I love this fast-paced multiplayer and the tons of killstreak rewards!And again the Zombies, although I can only approve them commonly, since I am only causal zombie-mode survivor....well and that's it. There is other side of the medal:Campaign is short... Intense. But short. Those 17 hrs on record (at the time) were: veteran completition, re-run regular, missed achievements and those dumb 33/33 findings. Occasionally I experience short, but insane fps drops (usually in beginning of mission and 1-2 times in-progress when friendly character makes a speech how screwd we are in the battlefield).As it comes to multiplayer, again:you have to face the most stupid, spoiled, cheated, childlish community. If you perform too bad = face your team ""cant do much more, look this guy *name* 3/17 hahah"", if you are too good = ""*name* hacker, go kill yourself, get cancer etc."" oh and who can forget infamous ""i f%ck your mom"", on top on flaming with virgins and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sizes (+++ for devs!!! you can disable chat finally!!!)the matchmaking in multi makes it overwhelmed with cheaters and DO mention only the visible one fullautoaim. I can only imagine how much soft things are in there: aiming supports, wallhacks, radarhacks, no recoils...and the usuall stuff to complain about multiplayer, see... this really bothers me, there are tons of snipers there. They only need 1 shot to kill you. And by 1 shot I mean 0.5 shot. Like shot in a leg through metal obstacle. Even from my very own experience I have to say something is really fishy about sniping and quickscoping in this particual game. I could swear on my very own life I already killed somebody with 'karbine?' by HEADSHOTting him directly into a stomach and killing somebody by sniping a wall 1 meter behind him... yeah.I'd like to state some negativity about the zombies, but again I'm only casual so I can't. I just like old-school zombies, normal zombies, normal zombie movies - slow walking dead to running HUMAN corpses. All this new information around - boosters, traps, fancy alien-upgrade weaponing, mutants, duozombie with bombs(?) ...its just too much for a casual like me.And finally (oh I hope I won't get banned for this)... we come to the final boss of cons of CoD WW2:The Political Correctness aka PC and his little fairies Social Justice Warriors aka SJW.This was just too much on top of all negative ""little"" things I mentioned earlier. I cannot wear to words how it ruins my immersive experience fighting alongside female characters in a WARGAME simulator. No, just no. You may argue now - ""fu gecko, its 2k17 and i drink starbucks glutenfree coffee now, we are way past female-oriented brutality in movies and gaming - what about females in LoL, Dota, MortalKombat or PUBG you racist and sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?!?!?!""... OK, but first 3 aren't war simulators, in PUBG you pick female thinking you'll have smaller character, to avoid bullets better (she is not smaller) and after all you end up watching her butt alltime in 3rd person... but there is 1 small thing there is in new CoD and isnt in PUBG: the devs put cosmetic death character animation here: DYING IN INCREADIBLY PAINFULL AGONY FEMALE SOLDIER ON B POINT BLEEDING OUT AND SCREAMING TO HELLS AND HEAVENS BECAUSE HER F***ING LEGS WERE TORN APART BY F***ING ARTILLERY BARAGE and SAME CRYING POOR FEMALE SOLDIER IN PAIN WHEN DYING FROM F***ING FLAMETHROWES FIRE... no, just no... really, who thought it was good idea? All of that on top of being still a WORLD WAR 2 game??And when we already talk about immersion I want to quote some random chinese wisdom in random online meme I've read: ""Call of Duty: World War II, because nothing is as immersive as playing black female paratrooper fighting on western front in Europe during WW2 on Axis side""....yeah the PC and SJW army you get it: females dying in terrible and painful death in war-game simulator = no problemo, but oups we have to censor all swastika in multiplayer (yes they really DID censor it!)... well devs aren't even pretending their multiplayer is actually PEGI 7+I just cant force myself out of ""Not recommended"" vote here. I remember on top of all negativity I pointed, this game costs 60€€€€ with possibility to grab S-Pass for another 50€€€€ (...aaaaand its still region based - EU only, as they stated). For that price they could at least give up on all this PC-SJW stuff and focus at least on longer campaign. Oh yeah I didn't mention that - PC-SJW is still present in singleplayer, much less though.Do I feel screwed by Activision? No. I will still enjoy the game. Good single campaign, multi mechanics. I am a CoD fanboi afterall. As a conclusion we come to the valuable lesson learned: Will never ever buy any more Call of Duty unless of course user review exceeds 90%, then maybe we can think about it."

												***UPDATE*** If I could give this pile of crap worse than a negative rating, I would.  Worst game I've ever had the displeasure of wasting money on.Steam may say I only have ~2 hours in COD WWII, that's my campaign time.  I have 26 hours in multiplayer according to Steam at the time of writing.-- The Bad --Not even close to being worth the money.The weapons deal realistic damage but they didn't make the maps big enough to compensate for that so SMG's and Rifles are stupid OP, like cross-map sniper killer OP.Speaking of weapon damage, the shotgun damage is practically non-existent unless you equip incindiary rounds which are handy to get you lots of From the Grave medals as the damage takes too long to be effective against the afforementioned OP SMGs and Rifles.Hitboxes are non-existent irritatingly frequently so shooting straight through someone with an M1903 is a common occurrence.I think I'm yet to go for a whole game without a death to someone who spawned right behind me or who I spawned in front of.  The spawns are so bad I've literally spawned in between four enemies.The game seems more like beta quality than ready for release, one example being you have to click the camo button at least three times to make it work (this is reproducable after every game).  I get the game is new, but Steam Greenlight games have an argument here, AAA titles that charge AAA prices don't.  On that topic, the servers were down for hours on launch day.SledgeHammer Games apparently thought it would be a good idea to build camping sites into the maps to help all the people that don't like to move so there are mounted MG42 HMGs in great spots to control half of the already tiny map.The ability of players to run is akin to that of someone with accute asthma in a field of pollen and regaining stamina is just as bad.Plus all the usual CoD BS such as jumping when turning a corner and lying on the ground whilst being shot at point blank range being valid strategies.-- The Good --The weapon sounds are awesome and from what I've played so far, the campaign is very good.  The automatic map callouts of enemy locations are a nice touch.  The game looks cool, even at medium settings and the Headquarters social area is nicely done (though, a confirmation to go there would be nice as the load times are not fun).-- Final Point --Tried to get a refund but sadly had played too many hours (I actually forgot refunds were possible through Steam until it was too late).  If you're on the fence, don't buy this - at least until they release some patches to fix all the brokenness.  If your money is burning a hole in your pocket, check out Black Ops III."

The multiplayer is too unremarkable compared to other ww2 multiplayer shooters and in the campaign I just felt like I was mindlessly guning down bad guys and got bored after a couple hours of it.

												WWII is one of the better Call of Duty games released in recent years which let down by some of the worst servers I have ever seen in gaming plus a distinct lack of anti-cheat as the developers promised. Optimisation issues, a wealth of bugs and hackers ruin what could have been a reasonable experience.The campaign sees you assume the role of US Army Private Ronald Daniels as he, and his 1st Infantry Division team join the war in 1944. The story spans around 12 missions from real life locations and events during the conflict. Health regeneration and ammo pick ups have been replaced with you now having to manually request such items from your squad which is a nice touch. Each mission is fairly well-crafted although there are far too many Hollywood set-pieces and exaggerated scenes that hijack the gameplay. Certainly worth a play and it'll take around 8 hours to finish on veteran. The multiplayer portion is thankfully back to its roots with boots on the ground and when everything is running smooth, it's a very enjoyable experience but unreliable servers and a string of progression bugs can frustrate.  Server-side lag, connection issues, terrible matchmaking, data not recording and even a loss of stats can completely ruin your efforts. This is not just affecting the PC platform though; console users have also been impacted this exact way and Sledgehammer even had to take down their entire dedicated server structure to fix the problems. Many issues still persist. The biggest and most inexcusible problem which has been prominent since day one and even on the beta is cheaters. As of writing now; not one single cheater has been banned either by the ignorant devs or automatically by the unfit for purpose VAC. Sledgehammer have IGNORED all in-game and social media user reports even with clear video evidence attached as proof. With no theater mode or working anti-cheat; the burden is on the community to prove someone is cheating rather than the developers doing the dirty work and even then all credible reports sent to them by the players have not been acted upon with the appropriate action taken. It's disgusting really and the ultimate kick in the teeth.  Overall; WWII could have been the best Call of Duty game since Black Ops 2 but instead, Sledgehammer have shot themselves in the foot with some truly awful execution of a promising game. Clapped-out dedicated serves, no anti-cheat, clueless developers and woeful matchmaking make this a far more frustrating rather than enjoyable experience."

												Horrible, in every wayI'm COD player and i almost played all COD versions till dates in both PC and PS, let me say that COD is well known for glitches and issues but this one has them all.1- Screen flickr - for some reason every time i start this game it causes my screen to flickr and i have to work around it to fix it.2- LAG - its nice to show the ping connection, but can you do anything about PING, its totaly bad experience when your always on RED and playing with FULL Green ping, I keep shooting a person in his back for two rounds while he needs single bullet to kill me.3- Cheaters, i bought this game in the very first day it was released, and after few minutes many players where at level 50+ can you pls explain that4- cheating, many cheating ways out there and COD not doing anything to stop them5- 110GB on my SSD is like USD $2506- Joystick sensitivity is too fast and impossible to aim 7- Motion is not as smooth FPS 120 FPS on ultra mode  1080p tripple monitors using AORUS Geforce 1080TI GPU, 7700K, M.2 960 Pro, 32GB 3200MHZ"

												Very disappointed.I haven't enjoyed a COD since MW2.  MW2 was great because the multiplayer gameplay is quality and very smooth.  The weapons and abilities are well balanced, giving the player the option of tweaking to their play style.  The maps are nice and varied by way of size, openenss, closed quaters, etc...  So far from what I've seen of COD WW2, it fails in all these areas.I was hoping COD WW2 would finally be a worthy contender to MW2 and bring back that awesome feeling of MOHAA, which I happily played online for 5 / 6 + years.  But it completely fails to bring a fun gaming experience that makes me want to come back for more.  After a few hours of play over the last couple of days I'm already very bored with it.- So far from what I have seen of the campaign it seems ok, I can't complain much.  Although the non-german weapons on the western front seems od, and I'm reading that people are finishing it 4 to 6 hours, seems a little short.- I don't much care for Zombies, no comment- The multiplayer, oh what a let down... The political correctness is over the top (black female germans, no swastika).  The maps are by far the worst multiplayer maps I have ever played in any FPShooter.  They remind me of running around  through rat tunnels with openings literally all over the place.  People just seem to spawn or come out of nowhere and get you from behind, it all seems too chaotic and unrealistic.  It makes it hard to 'read' and control a map in some game play types.  To be honest I dont actually get much of a European WW2 vibe from most of the maps either.  I was hoping for more maps like v2 rocket facilities, subbases, little towns, farm houses, hedges with 88s, etc...  oh wait, if you wanted to play Carentan you needed to pay more money.This will be my last COD."

												So I just played this game for a few hours campaign and multiplayer. if your expecting something different then you might be dissapointed... this game is basically the same♥♥♥♥♥♥everyone and there mom has played the last 5 years but with a ww2 paint job. enemies take 5... 6 or 7 bullets to kill (1 to 3 with bolt action rifles) in the campaign you will basically gun down 100 bad guys (nazis without swatstikas) lol. then move to the next area... gun down 100 bad guys... cutscene.... then rinse and repeat. the graphics I will say are very good though! especially in the cutscenes but yeah overall I wouldnt recommend this game. The multiplayer is too unremarkable compared to other ww2 multiplayer shooters and in the campaign I just felt like I was mindlessly guning down bad guys and got bored after a couple hours of it. PS: I hate to add more negetivity to this game but the AI is horrible. I cant tell you how many times friendly AI would just stand their while I was reloading and not fire one round at the nazis ten feet away emptying their magazines into me.... really?"

												Score: 2.5/10 on a good day. (DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY).Edit (2/20/18): Game still hasn't improved. In actuality, it's worse. Same♥♥♥♥♥♥ more of it.Edit: After a few more days, it's gotten even worse. Played a few matches two days ago, 4 lobbies in a row with sketchy players, but only 3 blatant cheaters. Today I get on and there's 3 lobbes in a row with people gloating about using aimbots and spamming the sky for kills. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME.Let me preface this by saying I haven't played CoD since BO2 on the Xbox 360, but I have always been a CoD fan, I loved 4-BO2 so much. Unfortunately, this is the final straw for me, and if you're looking for a game to actually have fun on, you should ignore this title. Let's start with the positives of the game, shall we?:-Great setting, WW2 hasn't been done in a while now, and boots on the ground is where it should be.-Nice audio for weapons and effects.-Decent graphics, nice and gritty.-Solid campaign so far and zombies aren't bad.-Should uninstall quickly. (Best feature).Now for the Cons (Only listing a fraction of them or I'd be here all night):-Cheaters, they're blatant and they're everywhere. No kidding, in 200 hours I've seen 60+ bare minimum. Keeps getting worse as time goes on. They promised an ""Anti-Cheat Suite"", and there's been nothing of the sort AT ALL besides a ""Report"" feature that does nothing, because they don't punish people.-Lag/frame drops on a solid pc/internet.-Client-side servers.-Game quite literally WILL NOT launch for seemingly no reason randomly, for many players.-Poor gun balance (BAR, STG, KAR98 is 90% of what you'll be seeing.)-AWFUL map design, and there's only 9 ♥♥♥♥ing maps in the entire multiplayer. (Excluding Carentan).-DLC only weapons. This is an issue carried from BO3, and they swore this wouldn't happen. They lied.-There's also only ONE zombie map at launch. (The tiny shack house doesn't count).-No ping display, instead there's an Xbox 360-esque ""Bar"" indicator. Because reasons. (♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port).-So many bugs that it makes the Amazon Rainforest jealous. Seriously, they're so numerous it's hilarious. Unsure whether to laugh or cry.-Microtransactions added before fixing hardly anything at all. (P2W guns are likely coming based on leaked info). (EDIT: I was right, sadly, but not surprisingly).-Predended that they would have PC support for once (lol).-They charged money for this horrendous joke of a game.These are just a few of the problems you'll encounter on this waste of time, money, and effort. I had immensely high expectations coming into this, but it barely makes the benchmark for a 7/10 without all of the bugs, cheaters, and microtransactions. The game had potential, but it's nothing but infuriating to join a lobby that's 4v6, against a wallhacker, and spawning in 30 seconds into the round, just to leave and join a different lobby of the exact same trash. This is just another game in the cycle of Activi$ion development: Rush a game for release date, don't fix bugs, then add in day-1 dlc for maps that should have been in the game at launch for $50+, then add microtransactions and abandon the game until the next title. The worst part is if by some miracle they actually started to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥and fixed their game and enabled some sort of anti-cheat, it's too late. The game is already down to a small fraction of the first week's playerbase and it's only been a few weeks. The cheating and lack of care of any sort killed this game before it had a chance. Don't get cheated, don't give these greedy devs and publishers your hard-earned money."

												Well, another call of duty. I bought it for 40 euros and its fine. Its not worth the full 60 euros tho. Let me explain.=CAMPAING:-Pros:*Seems fine i havent played it alot yet.*Pretty awesome cutscenes.*Swastigas*GORE*Some new stuff like squad orders and disabled health regeneration-Cons:*It too short*You dont feel really connected to the charactersCAMPAING: 8/10=MULTIPLAYER-Pros:*WW2 weapons*New killstreaks*Really fun*Supply drops can be earned without purchase and are just cosmetic (FOR NOW)*HQ is a pretty nice addition with orders , 1v1 arena n stuff.*Adition of divisions. I liked them alot.-Cons*Let me rant now. This company decited to add the LGBT flags into a ww2 game without even adding actual nation flags. This is getting disgusting. I mean what the hell are you thinking activision? So much bulls*h*t just to get the attetion of a minority? That, is , just , bad.*The rate of fire of the ppsh-41 and the mg42 is a complete joke. COMPLETE JOKE. I used to love mg42.*Realism in terms of real magazine sizes and stuff is non existent*Realism in terms of gore is non existent. WHY? I shoot someone from 1 feet with a double barreled shotgun and NOTHING happens. *Black female nazi soldiers. Nothing to say about that.*No swastigas.*Removal of the browning 50 cal.*I would really want to see more weapons*Shotguns need a huge buff, you shoot someone from point blank WITH A SHOTGUN and he just walks away.*Assault rifles need a little buffMULTIPLAYER: 6.5/10=ZOMBIES-Pros:*Addition of many new stuff like level progression and a kind of create a class system*Awesome looking zombies*Pretty good and big map-Cons:*ONE MAP? REALLY? I PAID 40 EUROS FOR ONE ZOMBIES MAP? JUST ONE? Let me guess, the others will be included in dlcs. . . .*The pap version of every weapon looks awfull*Some bosses are REALLY OP and almost impossible to fight in single player if you dont have the best weapons.*There is no need for so many fleshpound (from killing floor) zombies or the flamethrower ones in EVERY round, atlest make them appear after a few rounds.*Level progression doesnt transfer to offline mode, oh , i think you cant even play offline anymore. If thats the case, zombies suck.ZOMBIES: 8/10=Technical stuff-Pros:*Pretty good graphical wise.*Pretty good controls and interface-Cons:*Lack of offline supportTECHNICAL: 8.5/10=NOTES=That game could be really awesome, it could be the best cod ever released but seems like activision didnt want it that way. They could add more weapons to multiplayer and more maps on zombies. They could add an option to enable swastigas and gore in multiplayer. They just didnt want to. I hope one day this changes because that cod is seriously better than almost any other i have played  on last 4 years or more. The price is too high while it lacks of content. I would 100% recommend but not on full price.=OVERALL RATING=-8/10-"

The graphics are amazing, The gameplay (for the most part) is perfect and smooth (not sure why everyone is complaining about issues, my game runs smoothly. HOWEVER... The controls for the tanks are HORRID. I have played countless war games that give you the ability to drive tanks, vehicles, etc and this game is by far the WORST game to do it in, Instead of enjoying the tanks/vehicles, You will find yourself HATING it. It was one of the most painful things to experience in a video game, and honestly, thats saying a lot. Overall so far I give the game a 5/10, It has its ups as well as its downs. But for the $60 price tag, there are plently of better war games out there, and for cheaper too."

												Complete garbage. I'm still trying to play it more so I feel less ripped off for paying $60 for this trash, i'm not sure if I can though. The servers are so slow that you will see two COMPLETELY different things on your screen and the kill cam. Nothing like emptying 10 rounds into an enemy at point blank only to have them turn around and kill you instantly. On top of all of this, my system has a 3470k and 1070 6gb and the game constantly stutters and drops fps. I can run most modern titles on ultra with few to no FPS drops, but a game that looks barely better than COD WAW is performing terribly on low settings (yes, I did update drivers).I haven't even played the campaign, but I've seen gameplay and have no desire to. It looks like the most famous Saving Private Ryan scenes combined with some popular scenes from old COD games that didn't suck. The devs could have done something new like the north african campaign or fighting between the chinese and japanese, but instead opted to make single most generic WWII campaign experience they could come up with.Honestly, the only redeeming feature is zombies, but with only one real map, I can imagine it's going to get old pretty fast. They also included way too much emphasis on doing ""puzzles"", which aren’t actually fun after the first time. You have to complete the same monotonous ""puzzles"" every game to be able to survive the later waves. You can't even board up windows anymore for some reason.This is the first COD game i've bought since Black Ops and I wish I had the sense to refund it while I could.Should add that I've played MP for 12 hours."

												Concerning multiplayer...The only viable weapons are smg's or automatic rifles. Shotguns do less damage to an enemy's face than a sniper does to their foot, the difference means the sniper kills the enemy and the shotgun requires 2 more shots that you won't get off because their smg has hit you twice and killed you.The division system is nice but only being able to use one basic training means that you're not going to worry about something that could add variety and focus on sprinting or extra attachments.I haven't really played a COD since Black Ops 2 and honestly it seems like the game has taken many strides backwards. A lack of diversity and weapon balance means you're only seeing 3 or 4 guns being used and at best the maps feel like swiss cheese when there should be well defined lanes or routes with cover, something that experienced players can use to their advantage. Instead you have open areas where you get shot in the back 50% of the time because spawn switched 10 seconds after you respawned."

												I bought this game as a fan of several of the previous games. This was my first time playing on PC so I started off using a controller at first and then switched over to mouse and keyboard (which I prefered after trying both). Unfortunately this game is just a mess. Im sure it's because of the current business model  of releasing games that are 80% done and then fixing them after customers provide the r&d for them. Zombies was uterly confusing as to what I was supposed to accomplish. Multiplayer game modes like TDM seemed alright, although matchmaking is off as always (I would prefer if they also matched people based on rank since lower rank players dont have access to the guns that higher ranks do). However, this objective based war mode was terrible in my opinion. After playing it a few times I felt that it was probably the matchmaking that was the cause of my pain (I acknowledge im not that great a player), but I still felt that maps were heavily in favor of the defending side (provided both teams understand how to do what they are supposed to). I plan on asking for a refund, because the devs behind CoD just don't seem to understand how to make great games any more."

Also have a bug where randomly in-game OR headquarters where my character would suddenly stop working and keep going forward for about a few seconds even though im not pressing the forward key anymore, usually makes me run out in the open and i always get sniped. Until these bugs are fixed I am not playing the game and DEFINITELY not buying any rare supply crates.My system is above the recommended specifications so I don't believe that it is my system."

												(This review is very biased about the HISTORICAL side of this game)So I love history, and i loved the old call of duties. So to see them going back to their roots and making another WW2 game, I of cource got excited. I've noticed that a lot of historical games lately have not really been about being accurate but more about being fun and explosive, so to see them, the creators say in their own words that the campagin will be HISTORICALY accurate, i expected as much. Campaign: All though i havnt finished it yet, i can tell you this much, it isnt accurate at all, the first few minutes of the game and you will see russian weapons on the western front, which is tottaly obsurd. They try and shove some story down your throat with the relationship of 4 buddies that you have no connection with except one of them, who, again, they need to shove down your throat and painfully make it obvious that he is infact a JEW. They atleast got some of the names right, operation wise, like d-day and tbh i think thats the only real operation they have in that game that is legit, they got the places right though. It was nice to see the realism in the forest though, felt like i was really there for second when the nazis mortared the forest and you had to hide in the little holes the allied soldiers made.Now a lot of people are going to say, why take this so seriously? why over think a video game? my nibba, people over think tweets writen by our president and also, if you ask me this, ask a film critic, why are you a film critic?Now besides the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tery they called the campaign, lets move on to my opinion for the Multiplayer!Multiplayer: Its fun. I'm Addicted. I know that they had to get rid of the swasticas to make it ad friendly for e-sports so i can respect it, they still used a symbole that the germans used and even the nazis used for some of their medals and flags, so i will let that slide. But ♥♥♥♥ me in the butt and call me sally, who the ♥♥♥♥ thought adding women to the most sexist war and  racist war, the war that asked for men only, EVEN IN THE KOREAN WAR AND VIETNAM WAR WOMEN WERENT SEEN ON THE BATTLEFIELD, why the HELL would you add that. It isn't SUCH that big of a deal, you really dont notice till you kill one of them and they yelp like a female, of course. But the big problem is, is that they thought, they will add the name ""WW2"" the BIGGEST war fought by men, and  then decide to put women in it, females. i dont ♥♥♥♥ing know who thought of that but thats sorta insulting the vets and to historian ""100% accurate"" then decides to infalte♥♥♥♥♥♥on the modles, lmao.besides that, all the guns are fine, besides the STG44, which is extreamly over used and over powered.and all the other unrealistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that pisses me off:- MGs only holding 50 bullets, yep, someone thought that was cool.- MGs overheating in 5 seconds and taking 3 second to cool down (timed it), yep thats a thing.- snipers still having hitmarkers (ik its for balanceing, but historicly and realisticly, 7.62 to the leg, you dead my friend)- machine pistol (mauser c96) is some how, a machine pistol????- there was many things that annoyed me. but ♥♥♥♥ sake, dont say some stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like ""100% accurate"" if you ♥♥♥♥ing know it isn't gunna beZombies: Only played 2 games, cool that david tennaet was one of the guys in it, but besides that, still wont be the same as the good 'ol fashin, run and survive like WaW had, to much♥♥♥♥♥♥to do and only one map, hope they add more FREE maps, cause i sorta  spect cdn$80 to ♥♥♥♥ing test this♥♥♥♥♥♥out, f       u         c          kALL AND ALL, ONLINE IS OKAY, ZOMBIES IS FUN WITH FRIENDS, STUPID WITH RANDOMSAAAAAAAND CAMPAGIN SUCKS, will finish it though!will be NOT recommending this though because i was lied to by these cucks lmao,♥♥♥♥♥♥off*EDIT (SPOLIERS TO CAMPAGIN)*Alright so i finished it. and all though when i was playing i kept saying ""why"" to stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥that made no sense, the ending got me by suprise. I thought it was gunna be a happy ending but for them to actually make a mission were you walk through an abandon concintration camp and see the horrible things the nazis did, it gave me made respect for the people who wrote that up. Very little do we see that in games or movies about the war, it was a very sad and ♥♥♥♥ed up thing they did in ww2 and the whole scene was very well done, good job sledgehammer, you have got my respectREST OF THE CAMPAGIN SUCKS THO LOLOLOLOLOLbut honestly, it was fun to play and it had its stupid moments but it was like the old cods but looks beautiful. the whole concintration camp part caught me off gaurd so i thought i should have just added that to the review, gg SHG, gg"

												Every review shoud have something specific about as to something the writer wants to mention the other reviews are not mentioning so much. I understand this game has some major inconsistincies going for it regarding race, sex, and weapons types used during the war.What bugs me the most is that this does NOT feel like the player is vistiing Germany during the war. Simply put, there are NO swastikas anywhere. I understand that this could be offensive for some but if you are playing this for immersive, historicle purposes you will be gravely dissapointed. I understand that Germany in present day / real life does not allow the swastika to appear in any games whatsoever. That is perferctly fine. But the older Call of Duties has the flag in them and you really knew who the enemy was and what you were fighting for. Don't suggest this game as a mature title if you are going to water down in order to attract a larger sales base for all. This is lazy, stale design. I do not like the flag and what it represents (hopefully obviously) but eventually all blood and gore will be purple instead of red. (Another Germany design protocal.)Design rant aside, I got the deluxe version. It definitely isn't worth it as they is atroucious gambling and grinding to get any decent weapons. Lose the loot crates, especially on the beach. Quite an insult but then again, this game doesn't remotely want to be serious unlike the first 2 games."

												Buying this game was like going on a date with someone who used a fake profile pic for their Tinder account. Looked good from the trailers and promised historical accuracy and interesting characters in the campaign. Instead we got Wehrmacht with Soviet weapons on the Western Front and a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥ boys plus a jew in the campaign. Multiplayer is full of cheaters and people who abuse incendiary shells for fast XP. Zombies has the same mad scientist cliche and the mini bosses  remind me of my one nephew I just wanna punt every time I see him but I can't because apparently that's ""child abuse"". Overall this game is super disappointing and a huge Donkey Kong dong in everyone's favorite hole. Would not recommend."

												Run-of-the-mill generic WW2 game. The campaign story is lackluster, although the actual gameplay is decent. It's just nothing new.

												Long story short: Just watch Band of Brothers (2001) Yes, I am one of those guys that bought the game after the BETA and after giving some thoughts on the trailer that was released with the inclusion of Zombie. This review is solely on the campaign. The campaign was dissapointing as it was just over 8 hours, nothing stands out of being bad apart from a few historical points (yes I am bashing this heavily because of the heavy marketing Sledgehammer Games said they did for research purposes) but then there is nothing that stands out amazing. Here's some of the pros & cons you can expect from Call of Duty WW2:-PROS:-- Amazing sounds - No regenerating health (a breath of fresh air after the gung-ho nature for the past CODS) - A slice of each historical scene on all fronts- Voice acting is not too shabby (abit iffy for the Axis)- Unique supplies by squad-mates- Performance in game is as okay as it is a console portCONS:-- There were no M4A3 (76) Shermans during the D-Day landings at Normandy!! - The M4A3 (76) are able to punch through Panzer IV frontal armour!!- When the Tiger II (King Tiger) is referred as a Tiger- Finding Eastern small arms firearms during the D-Day landings- Tank & Air movements feels clunky and weird- Lack of variety in the vehicle & equipment department for both sides- Characters are plain and you do not connect with them, let alone your own protagonist- Women on the frontlineAfter all its said, this game could really use another year of development. Some of the scenes do have their cliche moments and also copied from other famous war films such as Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, Fury (a little bit) and others that I might had missed out. Overall, the game lacks creativity and I can wholeheartedly say that it is not worth its full price and for that it does not deserve my approval hence the thumbs down. Finally, like what I've mention in the beginning, this game has alot of cutscene as some are unnecessary so watching Band of Brothers (2001) would be your better source of entertainment! Thanks and better luck next time Sledgehammer Games!"

												This game is like a typical Michael Bay movie. Your expectations aren't high but in the end you're still let down. I was hoping for a more updated version of Call of Duty: World at War. This game however is a clear console port. The graphics are okay though and there's actually a lot of graphics options which surprised me. They’ve even included a FOV slider which is great. The headquarters lobby system and the different unlockable outfits, skins and whatever are a great way to keep you interesting. Were it not that the multiplayer is a complete shitefest. The maps are pretty much all horrible. Only in Call of Duty can there be a close quarter map with trenches where you’ll still able to walk around for minutes without finding someone to shoot at. Somehow Battlefield games run fine with 60 people on a single server. Call of Duty still uses the same horrible P2P hosting service and limits you to 6 versus 6 matches on maps that aren’t fit for it in my opinion. Enjoy getting shot around corners or getting killed by people teleporting around the map who look like they’re playing on a phone line out of the civil war affected part of Syria.The ship map is probably the worst Call of Duty experience I’ve ever had, and that actually means a lot. It looks like they tried to recreate a map similar to Wet Work in MW1. However, they failed hilariously. Everyone just stays in spawn with their sniper rifle and is fine with ending a TDM getting 3 kills and 3 deaths total. This is probably the last Call of Duty I’ll ever buy. I think they’ve completely lost all the charm that made MW1, WaW and even MW2 great games. And I’m not playing on a console, give us dedicated servers if you want your playerbase to keep playing the game. It’s not that difficult.And kindly take your season pass and shove it somewhere. I feel like I should be payed to keep playing this game in the future. Not the other way around. So if it wasn’t clear yet, I definitely do not recommend buying this game if you’re looking for a fun WW2 FPS. Furthermore, usually Call of Duty games have a simple but fun singleplayer campaign. The story is never great and all the action is scripted. Still it is a lot of fun to play through it. In this case there really isn't much of a story and there's no character development. I can remember Gaz or Ghost dying and being upset. In this campaign everyone is just a typical 2D American soldier without any depth or backstory besides the main character. The pre rendered cut scenes looked great though. So they do have that going for them.You’re better off buying a cheap World at War key somewhere. 4/10, Activision can suk mi cok."

												Hey guys party petee here to give u this reveiw of Call of Duty WWII for both single player as well as multiplayer!Ill start with single player, it is 100% exactly what i wanted out of the basically remake of World at War. It hit all the crucial points that a game like CoD needed to hit to make it 100% enticing to play. From driving in a humvee at maximum speed, to piloting war tanks onto the feild of battle! The sight of loosing a man close to you in your squadron to even the emoitial stress that occurs behind the scenes of battle with your commander, yes sir the single player really hit the mark in my book and will go down in history for being yet another great call of duty game.Now the multiplayer. This might shock you but multiplayer over the PC is just not the same as play with your friends on ur local home game console. It harbors quite a bit a people who just dont play the game the way that it should be for all these years. A constant issue with the game is the facor of how many normal players will u get in a game, and what % of those ones will be using a ""hacking"" or ""modding"" pluggin to make the game more diffucult for players not using those things... I had fun for maybe the 1st 2 weeks of the game being out, then all of the changes occured where you saw people using mods that made the multiplayer combat impossible for the normal player. A LOT of people want to play multiplayer when they finish single player because its just how CoD games work, but since this issue has risen to a higher extent, i will have to say that you should NOT BUY THE GAME if you really want to play multiplayer on PC. As activsion stated before the PC release that they dont have the ""technilogical programs"" to prevent hacking in the game and making it a real thing, i just flat out suggest NOT BUYING THIS GAME if you want to play mutliplayer at all. Until this issue gets fixed, which i would watch activision closly on so you know for sure it was fixed, just watch other people playing it on twitch and see their reactions to how the game feels unfair and make that another determined factor of purchasing the game.Well thats it lads, ill give a little rating here for both of the modes and you can be on your way! Single player 8.5/10 : Combat is solid, story line accurate, depiction of real battle on point. Bot programming is a bit off for certain encounters, intros on how to use certain vehicles and guns lacking correct information. Multiplayer: 6/10 : Guns deal decent damage and there is no one gun that is the best, items and guns are fairly balanced stats wise. Compeditive will not be released on PC due to modders/hackers being an active issue, Modders/Hackers control 65% of all game no matter what mode you pick, hp totals are quite weird, division leveling is bugged. Thanks all -PT"

												This game is like a typical Michael Bay movie. Your expectations aren't high but in the end you're still let down. I was hoping for a more updated version of Call of Duty: World at War. This game however is a clear console port. The graphics are okay though and there's actually a lot of graphics options which surprised me. They’ve even included a FOV slider which is great. The headquarters lobby system and the different unlockable outfits, skins and whatever are a great way to keep you interesting. Were it not that the multiplayer is a complete shitefest. The maps are pretty much all horrible. Only in Call of Duty can there be a close quarter map with trenches where you’ll still able to walk around for minutes without finding someone to shoot at. Somehow Battlefield games run fine with 60 people on a single server. Call of Duty still uses the same horrible P2P hosting service and limits you to 6 versus 6 matches on maps that aren’t fit for it in my opinion. Enjoy getting shot around corners or getting killed by people teleporting around the map who look like they’re playing on a phone line out of the civil war affected part of Syria.The ship map is probably the worst Call of Duty experience I’ve ever had, and that actually means a lot. It looks like they tried to recreate a map similar to Wet Work in MW1. However, they failed hilariously. Everyone just stays in spawn with their sniper rifle and is fine with ending a TDM getting 3 kills and 3 deaths total. This is probably the last Call of Duty I’ll ever buy. I think they’ve completely lost all the charm that made MW1, WaW and even MW2 great games. And I’m not playing on a console, give us dedicated servers if you want your playerbase to keep playing the game. It’s not that difficult.And kindly take your season pass and shove it somewhere. I feel like I should be payed to keep playing this game in the future. Not the other way around. So if it wasn’t clear yet, I definitely do not recommend buying this game if you’re looking for a fun WW2 FPS. Furthermore, usually Call of Duty games have a simple but fun singleplayer campaign. The story is never great and all the action is scripted. Still it is a lot of fun to play through it. In this case there really isn't much of a story and there's no character development. I can remember Gaz or Ghost dying and being upset. In this campaign everyone is just a typical 2D American soldier without any depth or backstory besides the main character. The pre rendered cut scenes looked great though. So they do have that going for them.You’re better off buying a cheap World at War key somewhere. 4/10, Activision can suk mi cok."

												Only thing I liked about is the campaign, yet it was a bit short compared to other games.  But the stupidity of the dev team to include inaccurate weapons to the Nazi Wehrmarcht on the Eastern Front is not even close to be forgiveable.  Like cmon giving them PPSH-41's and SVT-40's like cmon just google what weapons they had.  That would be understandable if we are on the Western Front in Russia were the Wehrmarcht was using what they could find to replace their lack in resources.  Weapons ♥♥♥♥ ups like the M1897 Trench Gun holds in real life 5 shells not 7. (smh).  PPSH-41 drum magazine is 71 rounds not the 50 ish they have in game, and they also need to include accurate fire rate of weapons. (along with other weapon design flaws).  The MG 15 is the complete wrong weapon to give the Germans as a squad machine gun should be either the MG 34 or 42.  The devs obv subscribed to the looney left policy of being PC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t by including cenorship and basically rewritting history to suit them over protraying true historical events how they happened .             IF YOU ERASE THE PAST YOU ARE BOUND TO REPEAT IT."

												This game is mediocore here's some pros and here's some consPros:  - The game runs smooth and graphics look amazing! - The mechanics of the game works great ( no bugs, no glitches, etc ) - Finding a match is very quick and connection is strongCons:  - In order to kill someone you need to use a substantial amount of bullets ( Around a half to a whole mag ) - The Zombies for some reason reminds me of the Extinction gamemode from Call of Duty : Ghosts with jump scares. - Hit marks Hit markers Hit markers, yet no kill ( that's all I'm going to leave it at ) - Killstreaks and other background noises are VERY distracting and confusing. - Campaign is not really the best I've played. (  just a bunch of pointless shooting and killing ) - Community is somewhat cancerous.At the end of the day, unfortunately I would have to say I would not recommend this game, I have tried to keep finding an interest and liking in it, but I just don't. Especially if you are paying $60 US Dollars for it, if it were $30 that would be a different story."

												Singleplayer:  Possibly the most overhyped 'Realistic' game a game company anyone has ever put out.  The first campaign was so intense in the beginning. Yes it felt like Saving Private Ryan in a video game but other than that, 5 minutes into storming Normandy Beach, I kill a German soldier who drops a PPSH. Yup you read that right. The REALISTIC campaign these ♥♥♥♥ing morons spent '3 years working on' isn't even realistic. Like we all were excited to play your 'boots on the ground' Call of Duty. You sold us on the realism. But you lied.  You failed just as the last 4-5 titles have as well.Multiplayer:  Now I mostly buy these games for the online aspect. Grind out the 10 or so pretiges. But this game just drags. No double xp weekends. Horrible tiny maps that make shipment from MW look like a normal sized map. Oh and just 9 maps. Really just 9?  And the biggest grief of all? The cheaters. Yah you may not get them in Core or War cause of the killcams but as a devoted HC player I find myself backing away from the game mode that made me love this series. It just seems like every other game has at least 1 or even 2 hackers just going full blatant.  They even say it at the beginning of the game becuase they know they won't get banned it seems.Final conclusion. I have been a fan of the Call of Duty franchise since Call of Duty 1. I've like or even loved everyone of them up until 2012. Then the downfall came. Jet packs, boosting, horrible space marine stuff. Map design went down the drain along with Call of Dutys name they've built for the last 14 years. So if you were looking for that realistic campaign to bring you back? Keep looking. You want that in depth multiplayer action? Keep looking.  Time to wait another year to just get disapointed again."

There was some beauty in ""old"" Call of Duty games which you simply can't achieve with the new stuff.

												This game has potential.Take Black Ops 2 and skin it to look like WW2. If you like Black Ops 2 then you will like this game... unfortunately it is filled with hackers, i played about 13 multiplayer matches and i had 4 blatant aimboters. This will kill the game if it stays like this. As of 11/27/17 there is a decent community and it very smooth to find and get into a match. But since this game has no worthy protection against hackers then the call of duty franchise for the pc community will never return.Zombies is 50/50 for me. On one side, the zombies themselves are well done and the map as well and even the storyline gets bonus points with me. But the thing that gets me is that they want you to grind to get any of the ""good weapons"". I played 5 games with the first 3 being back to back and they didn't count towards my progression because of the host leaving and the game couldn't find a host. That made us lose all of our xp, and when you are at wave 20+ and you are trying to grind some of the first few levels then it feels taxing and makes you discouraged to play another. During my last game, my team decided that they wanted to do the easter egg and ""finish the game"". So we do all the required steps and during the final part, the boss leaves and was supposed to come back which he didn't. My buddy to look for some answers on Reddit and the only thing that came up was that he was stuck behind some wall and there was no way of getting him out. Therefore, after a hour game we had to wipe becuase the rounds wouldn't move on with the game only giving us the same 2 zombies to kill.My final thoughts on this game is that it has potential. if the hackers were delt with and the bugs were fixed then this game would be half decent. Even with Activisions budget and profits made with microtransactions (which are in this game) there is no excuse for them not being able to fix this problem. Its a swing and a miss for me by activision, and they have some work to do if they want this community to last."

												Only thing I liked about is the campaign, yet it was a bit short compared to other games.  But the stupidity of the dev team to include inaccurate weapons to the Nazi Wehrmarcht on the Eastern Front is not even close to be forgiveable.  Like cmon giving them PPSH-41's and SVT-40's like cmon just google what weapons they had.  That would be understandable if we are on the Western Front in Russia were the Wehrmarcht was using what they could find to replace their lack in resources.  Weapons ♥♥♥♥ ups like the M1897 Trench Gun holds in real life 5 shells not 7. (smh).  PPSH-41 drum magazine is 71 rounds not the 50 ish they have in game, and they also need to include accurate fire rate of weapons. (along with other weapon design flaws).  The MG 15 is the complete wrong weapon to give the Germans as a squad machine gun should be either the MG 34 or 42.  The devs obv subscribed to the looney left policy of being PC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t by including cenorship and basically rewritting history to suit them over protraying true historical events how they happened .             IF YOU ERASE THE PAST YOU ARE BOUND TO REPEAT IT."

												I pre ordered the digital deluxe edition on my computer and tbh it's not that fun just less than 1 hour of gameplay and I got bored and I'm a huge COD fan I thought this call of duty would revive the franchise but it didn't. And whats been bothering me about this is that i pre-ordered the deluxe editon and I never got the exclusive content so i basiclly just threw 100 dollars in the drain.Also game is really buggy and glitchey and people in multiplayer just take advantage of its exploits and glitches and it ruins the fun and the zombies are not that fun either. I'd say the only good thing about this game is the campaign, good story and fun gameplay but other than that your just paying 60-100 dollars for a piece of garbage made by sledgehammer. To be honest I think you be happier playing battle field 1 but if you already have it then just save your money and spend it on a game worth playing. Also last thing about this call of duty is that it's the same gameplay just like the last couple ones and people just do the same thing and every COD is just the same thing and it ruins the game and seeing this just makes me not want this game anymore and I think the call of duty franchise will die soon and I won't be surprised but the game is super buggy and I would give it a month or two 3 to the max and see if the game changes but if it doesn't I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game. I hope this review helped anyone thinking about buying this game."

												story's great despite beeing so short I almost finished it in one sitting. The graphics are stunning and so are the cutscenes, but it's heavy to run, my two overclocked  gtx 970s in sli could run this at 1440p, but only at 30-40 fps (while GTA 5 runs at a user capped 60fps) with 1fps 1% lows. lowering the resolution to 1080p helped as the fps is now >70 , and the fps drops became less common. This might be the game hating on SLI, as one of my friends has a potato pc and he runs it smoooooth as butter at low settings.  The online seems good, i havent played it as much, but the textures are not impressive at all, even at max it looks more like some screenshot off a ps2 (i am not joking) this is mostly just visible on the caracters in the lobby though. I give this game a 7/10"

												Singleplayer:  Possibly the most overhyped 'Realistic' game a game company anyone has ever put out.  The first campaign was so intense in the beginning. Yes it felt like Saving Private Ryan in a video game but other than that, 5 minutes into storming Normandy Beach, I kill a German soldier who drops a PPSH. Yup you read that right. The REALISTIC campaign these ♥♥♥♥ing morons spent '3 years working on' isn't even realistic. Like we all were excited to play your 'boots on the ground' Call of Duty. You sold us on the realism. But you lied.  You failed just as the last 4-5 titles have as well.Multiplayer:  Now I mostly buy these games for the online aspect. Grind out the 10 or so pretiges. But this game just drags. No double xp weekends. Horrible tiny maps that make shipment from MW look like a normal sized map. Oh and just 9 maps. Really just 9?  And the biggest grief of all? The cheaters. Yah you may not get them in Core or War cause of the killcams but as a devoted HC player I find myself backing away from the game mode that made me love this series. It just seems like every other game has at least 1 or even 2 hackers just going full blatant.  They even say it at the beginning of the game becuase they know they won't get banned it seems.Final conclusion. I have been a fan of the Call of Duty franchise since Call of Duty 1. I've like or even loved everyone of them up until 2012. Then the downfall came. Jet packs, boosting, horrible space marine stuff. Map design went down the drain along with Call of Dutys name they've built for the last 14 years. So if you were looking for that realistic campaign to bring you back? Keep looking. You want that in depth multiplayer action? Keep looking.  Time to wait another year to just get disapointed again."

												By far the worst Call of Duty ever made. They managed to go back to basics with it being world war two and no flying nonsense, and still managed to make it horrible.It was clearly not finished upon release, filled with bugs that still persist and probably won't ever be fixed. Every match ends with you staring at robot characters doing emotionless dances for an entire minute without being able to leave or change your class.The snipers are better than every gun at every range.Enemies are 2 seconds in the future and kill you before you even turn the corner, but in killcam view they just killed you normal and you weren't even looking? Absolute horrible network problems that will not be fixed ever.50% of games are filled with blatant hackers. Nothing seemingly done about it. Report function feels worthless.And on top of all of this, the game just sucks. They took away the point system and gave worthless ""Divisions"" that take away all creativity and originality to class making. You know have to pick between 2 classes, because the other 3 are absolutely worthless. The guns are all lasers and kill you instantly at any range even though it's a world war 2 game. Bolt rifles are non existent in a world war 2 game, which is a joke.In conclusion, this is by far the absolute worst Call of Duty ever made, and I am not exaggerating in the slightest. I have played EVERY SINGLE ONE and this one takes the cake. It's even worse than call of duty 3. Don't get ripped off with this garbage. This is EARLY STAGE BETA at best.PS: I have over 80 hours played, for some reason it only lists my SINGLE PLAYER hours. I have played this game EXTENSIVELY."

												Single player is good, Story is short but it feels very authentic. Multiplayer is pretty much every COD previous. BS quick scope, hoppers, divers, all the usual disappointment with that and now a form of cash shop. Map rotation is poorly done as it seems like only three maps are ever played. Over all, single player was well worth the price (on sale, I wouldn't pay full price for that.) Multiplayer is disappointing at best given that I group hackers and quick scopers into the same catagory. ((Please keep in mind this is my view of the game and that you may feel free different than me but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.))So in short - Single player 8/10 ((would have been 10/10 but the story is a bit short))   Multiplayer 2/10 ((but this should be expected from any COD game by now.))"

												The game is great.  The multiplayer is filled with hackers though.  The store page shows it's VAC enabled but it's not.  Every hacker you can see has VAC bans on their profile but here there are still playing the game... or it's their only game....The actual game's properties show it doesn't use VAC.  Completely misleading.  Despite all the negative reviews about the game ... it's a great game.  It runs great, the maps are designed well, it loads fast, the guns are all effective, they patch in new content.... but none of it matters because some cheater runs through the center of the map shooting his gun into the air and headshots everyone.  The one or two matches you get with legit players keeps you wanting to play more but once you get 3 or 4 in a row with the blatant hackers and you realize the devs aren't doing anything here.  And it's making players leave fast because queue times are starting to get really bad. There have been times I would queue up and there's just noone playing.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Unless they start banning cheaters or doing anything to stop them I can't recommend this game at all.  And that's not to mention how many racial slurs and anti-everything insults you'll have to hear through the voice chat if you actually keep it on.... this game's multiplayer is where you go to verify that humanity is failing itself."

												Not sure where to start... I'll try to keep it brief.Another bloated, self-important AAA title with nothing new to offer.

The interface is complete junk... Thanks for making a clunky port of a console game, Activision. Embarrassing. Disappointed I let my buddies talk me into getting this one, but hey, shame on me. I would not recommend this game unless you've got money burning a hole in your pocket and you're just after bright lights and loud noises.PS - I will acknowledge that ""War"" game mode for multi-player is a good idea, just too bad that it's surrounded by the rest of this otherwise unremarkable game."

												the multiplayer of this game has so many glaring issues and people leave LOTS of constructive criticism yet the developers havent done much about them yet.to just list a couple of issues the game has right now:- you die too often to stupid bs like bad spawns, bad netcode, random nades as they one hit kill if you dont pick a certain division- game mechanics that reward camping and punish aggressive play styles:a) it takes too long to shoot after runningb) zooming while moving makes you slower and not zooming makes you inaccurate, so if you wanna kill a camper without nades you will move slow and are an easy target  (you have to pick another specific division to move faster while zooming)  you can only pick one division per class. that means you can only counter one issue at a time. these should not be countered by the division choice, they should just not exist at all.- the map design is just horrible compared to what they used to have back in mw2, maybe a third of the current 9 maps are decent and that's pushing it. if you wanna perform well in most game modes you have to camp somewhere on the corners of the map, as in the middle of most maps you can get shot from way too many angles- ranked games: there are no bots you can control if someone leaves, and people leave. a lot. i dont know why but in 7 out of the 10 ranked games ive played so far, we had less players than the enemy or they had less than us.in ranked games you can not freely choose what map/mode you want to play, you get to choose from 2 given map/mode combinations and a random one. why? why cant you choose which map or mode you want to play?- and last but not least: the price is not justified at the current state of the game. dont buy it from steam if its not on sale.neutral:- lots of people say they have problems with cheaters, ive played this game for around 40 hours so far and have only faced like five. so not a big deal at all, you can just leave.  i dont understand why you dont have the option to kick players though for those few cases.- loot boxes are containing cosmetic items and exp boosts only, so thats fine with me. the way the game is pushing the crates though is a little annoying- not all maps have released yet: there will be DLC maps and i hope they'll be better after all the critique the current ones receivedpositives:- the war mode is quite fun if people play the objective, gets repetitive after a while though as there are so few maps. and the first dlc will just deliver one more war mode map.- the single player campaign was pretty good imo, but not on the same level as some other cod games. took like 5-6 hours to complete, its not the games main selling point- havent played the zombie survival mode yet but ive heard its fun with friends and i saw that it offers lots of options/customizability so thats a plus- as someone who played over 1k hours of CoD games years ago it was a somewhat nostalgic experience for me, however as i played 2k hours of counter-strike in the mean time i could spot a lot more issues CoD has.  I might have enjoyed the game more if i had not played a competitive FPS for such a long time.All in all, i cannot recommend this game to you in good conscience as this is the CoD game I will play the least of all that I've tried. I feel like the negatives just heavily outweigh the positivesI am certainly going to check out the upcoming DLC but I fear it won't change enough."

												Honestly if you want zombies its not bad, but that being said the multiplayer is hot ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. Hacking is rampent (No VAC secured servers) and weapon balance is garbage, maps are to big for the amount of people in a game (atleast for tdm) you spend 90% of the time you're alive looking for people to kill only to be kill by someone in a corner. The multiplayer also runs poorly, I experience stuttering issues on normal graphics with a GTX1070 and an i7-7700k. Into zombies, I was pleasently suprised by the zombies mode in this game runs smooth and feels great to play, the map isnt amazing but ive seen far worst in the past. But the lack of alternate maps to play on makes the experience less enjoyable (gets old after a while). And a few other things that are annoying; game comes as two installs which both need to be installed to play stupid and annoying, advertised as having local multiplayer/splitscreen which it does not, you pretty much have to reload the entire game if you want to switch activities. TL;DR - Multiplayer is a mess (filled with hackers) and preforms poorly on good systems at low settings, zombies is enjoyable but has limited maps two in total. Recommendation - Just go buy BlackOps 1 if you are looking for a cod game for PC, much better multiplayer (less hackers) and its zombies is still great. Save yourself the money and pass on this one.Will update if Sledgehammer gets their heads out of their asses."

												I purchased and started playing the game Jan 16. I really enjoyed the campaign version of the game on my PC, as I have the other COD games, but my enjoyment was cut short with the Jan 23, 2018 update. The game froze on startup everytime. My communications with the Activision support team seemed to be going fine, they escalated the matter when the chat person couldn't solve it, and then they stopped communicating. I went in through chat to see why they stopped and they got back to me today. They cited the minimum graphics card requirement of GTX 660 and my GTX 650 no longer cuts it. No comment on why the game worked really well up until the  Jan 23 update with the apparently seriously deficient GTX650. So, their answer is a new $400-$600  graphics card to support a $79 game. Well done Activision!  I would still like to finish a fun game that I was about half way through, but it appears this game is done for me. Nice show of respect for your fans Activision!"

They reuse the same engine that doesn't catch cheaters at all.  Even if everyone reports the player is a cheater nothing will happen.  I had a game where 4 cheaters (they admit it) in same game.  I will NEVER buy COD games again because of this reason only.  Activision will not do anything about it because they made money off from you already.  They are only keeping the servers running until a new game comes up and all the sheeple moves on over.  I am warning everyone here, do not buy this game because the already low in game players will drop even more when more and more cheaters download the cheats online without bans."

												Snipers dominate this game. It is WAY too easy to score a kill if you are a completent sniper. Watch the replays and snipers get their kills without even being on mark. They just zoom in and shoot, and if a competitor is somewhere near the middle of their zoom-scope, they are history. If you don't want to play as a sniper then you are at a significant disadvantage. This is not good gameplay. One shouldn't be forced into one of a number of gameplay options to remain on par in terms of competitivness. I would go so far as to say that this feature of the game makes it significantly less enjoyable than it otherwise would be.I have come back to COD after black ops 2. Much less enjoyable. The level design might also have something to do with this."

The review page probably will only show the hours in single player mode, but if you want to you can verify my real hours on my steam profile. Singleplayer I started it, because otherwise you cannot write a review. I watched the intro and was kinda hyped, but the moment when gameplay started I wanted to alt+f4 immideately. It all starts with how cruel war is, but then you proceed to kill at least 50 Germans on your own in the first 15 minutes of the game. Also you have absolutely 0 freedom in what you are doing and the AI are the dumbest idiots ever. They will just stand there waiting to be killed.It feels like a movie, but takes probably 6-8 hours to complete (judging from other reviews). Did you ever want to watch a 8 hour movie ? Yeah me neither. I'd rather watch Private Ryan four times than play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But I knew that and didn't buy the game for this reason, so lets go to the multiplayer.Multiplayer  gameplay and balance  The general gameplay is good. Time to kill feels great and it is an easy game to play after a stressfull day. That's also what kept me interested for 80h. But it also has a quite a few problems: Some guns are just inferior to other guns. In every aspect. One example for the shotgun class: The standard shotgun is quite good. Kills in one shot up to a range where you would expect it from a shotgun and has 5 shots. Then there is the double barrel ""Luftwaffe"" shotgun. It has only 2 shots, less range, less damage and is more inaccurate. Wtf. This holds for a lot of guns in the game.Also all objective based gamemodes are ruined by grenade spam. I always was the guy who never played the objective and just killed those who tried (mostly played FFA though). The capture radius for flags is so small that you always get killed by a grenade. There is no fun in playing the objective and because of that most players will just do what I did.The new war gamemode is fun, but playing the same objectives in the same order can only be fun for so long. Since there are only 3 maps for this mode I stopped playing it completely after a few times.   maps  There are 9 maps. 3 of them are exlusively for the new war gamemode. This means that there are only 6 maps for the normal gamemodes. That's.... not a lot. Also none of them really stand out. They are ok, but not particularly amazing. I also think it is weird that except the D-Day war map there is no recognizable location. If they didn't put the locations in the map names noone would ever recognize it. Also: London Docks ? I mean I am no history expert, but I kinda missed the infantry battle at the London Docks.I also want to express my hate for one particular map: Flak tower. This map feels like Sledgehammer games just didn't want to create another map, but one of them said: ""Hey guys I got a great idea: My 3 year old drew random lines on a piece of paper this morning. Let's just use that and fill it with props."" Honestly, it is even smaller than all of the other maps and you can always get shot from 5 directions. Wtf is this.  The dealbreakers  The netcode. It is absolutely beyond me how a franchise which releases the same game every year is still not able to have proper netcode. The strength of dropshotting is not that your enemy misses, but that the server will not be able to process your hitbox correcly and thus you can't be hit. I don't know how many times I've been exactly on the target and still missed my shot.  The lootboxes. How can a 60€ game which also sells a 50€ season pass (which I did not buy) still have such a scammy lootbox system. You can get them through gameplay aswell, but in my 80h of gameplay I have not gotten a single good looking skin for the guns I actually play. All you get is one of 400 Pistol grip skins. It's completely obvious the only exist to make the chance of getting anything useful lower. And if you actually get a weapon skin it for sure will be the ""battle-scared"" variant, which against looks like complete garbage. The good looking ""heroic"" skins are so rare, that they are absolutely unobtainable through regular gameplayAnd let's not even start with duplicates.Ah and btw: all the camos you can regularly unlock look like trash to make you buy lootboxes"

												This review is for the multiplayer only:It's not worth it. The lag is worse than it was in previous titles. They haven't made any progress in the past 8 or so years and it's to the point where it's unplayable. I regret purchasing this game and steam wouldn't give me a refund after 11 hours of 'gameplay.'(4 hours were just me trying to configure the graphics settings so that I would get hit detection.)Here's why it's unplayable:- The biggest problem is that there are certain people with really good connections to the servers that see everything 2 seconds before you do. This is apparent when you look at killcams. For example, instead of showcasing how gunfights actually took place, on numerous occasions against the same players it doesn't even show you firing an entire clip into them when you know you did in reality. You can do everything right: get position advantage, fire first, actually be on target; but it won't matter. The person on the other end is also ALWAYS on top of the scoreboard going like 30-4 or something. They can be totally horrible too; I often observe them run out into the middle of the map and get most of their kills through mindless hipfire rather than actual aim. To get killstreaks, if I see them and have a clear shot from behind at close range, I sometimes even avoid them. This is gamebreaking.- Hackers every 3 - 4 lobbies that use aimbot to get automatic headshots- Hit detection is OK at best in some lobbies, but non-existent in others. Like I said, you have to be on point with an entire clip to kill some people. The problem is that even if you do manage to get the kill, you've spent so much time trying to kill that one guy that his teammate can sneak by from around the corner and instakill you. So often times if you have connections similar to mine, you'll go 10-10 or 11-10 or 9-10 because after every kill you get, you'll get killed instantly afterwards. It's nearly impossible to carry teams in these kinds of lobbies. By the way, I have a strong wired connection with an open NAT.- Soundwhoring is too much of a thing. People can know where you are from too far away. It's unrealistic and unfair to those who don't have a 300$ set of headphones.TL;DR: Just don't."

												So, this game looks good and performs well. Effort was put in to injecting a bit of creativity (ie. War mode, class system, and social hub). However, it is only fun for about ten to fifteen hours before you begin to realize how little content there is. The lack of content is also made worse by the lack of dynamic gameplay - every encounter plays out the same. This would be a good buy for twenty dollars, but good luck with that (COD titles never go on sale or see price drops). The lack of content and stale gameplay translates to a purchase I regret. Note: Lack of game time is because I haven't really touched the campaign and that's what raises the counter.Edit: BE WARNED - as of 11/20/2017, the game is overrun by hackers. 9/10 lobbies contain a hacker. Sledgehammer's claim that they would fix this issue that arose in beta is a flat out lie."

												I wasn't sure if I should give SHG more time to make the game better or not, but I think right now is a good time to say a few things about it.So we all know the typical Call of Duty release, right? You get the same package: Singleplayer Campaign, Online and Local Multiplayer and Zombies modes.The singleplayer campaign is decent, but predictable. I understand they've been trying to make characters cliche on purpose for the sake of the WWII setting, but I wasn't too impressed with the overall experience, except for a level or two where things get better.The main bread and butter for the longevity of a Call of Duty game have for awhile been the Zombies and Multiplayer experiences.Which brings me to a problem here and that is: the PC version of Call of Duty is a decent port with plenty of graphical options, dedicated (and p2p) servers etc.The problem I have had with the MP side of things is that the game feels rushed. The game design is horrible and promotes a lot of slow paced combat due to enemy footsteps being lower in volume than friendly ones, the map selection and design are poor, game modes are dying left and right despite the fact that they've put in daily/weekly missions to encourge you to do so, gun variety is very bad right now, the game has plenty of microtransactions, even though they don't affect gameplay and overall the MP package feels.....unbalanced and incomplete.Sure, Zombies still remains fun and I recommend it to anyone with a group of friends, but Zombies have never been an issue at all in CoD, especially in the long run where people usually play Multiplayer and that's it.With that being said, I can't give you comfort in your decision to get the game or not. I can however ask you to think if you REALLY love the Call of Duty franchise (or not), because ultimately the clock's ticking and next year there's another Call of Duty up for release (probably in November as per usual) from the better developer, Treyarch Studios.So what will you choose?"

												I thought they would of smartened up and actually catch cheaters like PUBG, however, just like ALL the other COD games steam and activision doesn't care.  They reuse the same engine that doesn't catch cheaters at all.  Even if everyone reports the player is a cheater nothing will happen.  I had a game where 4 cheaters (they admit it) in same game.  I will NEVER buy COD games again because of this reason only.  Activision will not do anything about it because they made money off from you already.  They are only keeping the servers running until a new game comes up and all the sheeple moves on over.  I am warning everyone here, do not buy this game because the already low in game players will drop even more when more and more cheaters download the cheats online without bans."

												An HD re-release of the original Call of Duty at best. Worth, at most, $15. Here is a list of the game's various offenses: Bland, forgettable characters with cliched personalities. Little historical accuracy. German soliders were dropping Russian SMGs in the first level. Subpar sound design. Weapons sound nothing like their real world equivalents. Recycled animations and mechanics from previous Call of Duty games. No new gameplay innovations. The same old and tired 'get in turret to shoot the thing', 'drive a vehicle during a clunky on-rails segment', 'do some generic action movie nonsense via QTEs', and so on. Over-abundance of cutscenes and scripted sequences. Game's installation footprint is almost 80gb. 80! For nothing!It's a deficient product to be released in 2017; simple as that."

												Such high hopes for this game, what a pity.This game should have revived Call of Duty from what it had become - futuristic over-the-top dizzying 'action.' Instead, we got a broken mess of a game. I'll break this into 2 parts, Multiplayer and Zombies, as I barely played the campaign (although what I played was OK, I just don't enjoy CoD campaigns anymore).MULTIPLAYER - The mode the majority of people expected to rise CoD gameplay from the ashes of the past 3 games. The default maps are mostly garbage to atrocious, although one or two are decent, not rave worthy. The maps are often FAR too open to flank, offering 2 or 3 paths around the place, nowhere near enough for the objective based games, such as SnD, Gridiron (which should have stayed in the Exo games, as it is built for that movement system) and CTF. Basically the only modes that are populated are TDM, War (whichcould be so much better with what other games like BF have introduced) and Prop Hunt when it's around. The guns are so unbalanced it's not funny. The STG, Volksgewehr and Bar are basically the only 3 guns that are ever used, and have not been nerfed to a balanced standard since launch. Currently, dual wield pistols are the OP class used by people who don't know how to use guns that require skill. The knifing system is on par with BOII, although wildly inaccurate or pinpoint accurate. As well as this, SHG are yet to really do anything about hackers. They've banned a few accounts, but that's it. They are still common and ruin everything. It also makes anyone who can actually do anything remotely commendable nervous to do so, since anyone can be accused of hacking, and an entire lobby will report anyone, even without any evidence, Just the mention makes everyone report. Very sad, since my friend had his ENTIRE Call of Duty account banned, despite not hacking. If he wants to play CoD on Steam now, he needs to make a new account now. A dissapointing, poorly optimised mess that barely resembles what CoD used to be. The only reason I play it is to get dold weapons to use in zombies, which I have everything done anyway.MODE SCORE: 3/10ZOMBIES - The mode that, in recent times, has been the saving grace for the series. Sadly, at this current time, it is a shell of what the mode has become. It has barely any replay value, like BO3 and IW zombies. The 2 other studio's offerings had plenty of challenges, camos* and reticles* that could be unlocked, adding new ways to play/using items that normally wouldn't suit you (*Black Ops III). The lack of camos that can be earned in the mode means that if you want any, you HAVE to play the MP, exluding the pre-order bonus and Twitch Prime camos (which are both rubbish imho). There are a few challenges that unlock new characters to use, although they lack in dialogue and any personality (DLC maps feature 'recolours' of these same characters). The challenges themselves can be either easy to complete, relying far too heavily on RNG or completely ridiculous, especially if you don't have friends. The atmosphere they went for is there, but getting 'jumpscared' every 20 seconds destroys any fear-factor that was or could have been there. There are few side-easter eggs, making the main quest(s) the only thing that can be done other than survival. The mode isn't bad, but it has barely anything to lure you back to play.MODE SCORE: 6.5/10OVERALL - This Call of Duty makes me fear what will happen to the series. While I enjoyed IW, I want a good ol' boots-on-the-ground CoD that has decent maps, good balancing, enjoyable matches, less hackers (not entirely the devs fault, but still) and listens to feedback from the community and addresses it better than SHG did (the zombies community has been brushed off with their feedback, because MP community is more important to SHG). Treyarch has proven to be the most capable at all of these things of the 3 dev teams (and Infinity Ward are getting better at it too), and I am looking forward to their CoD so much more than I did this one (and I was very excited at what SHG was showing). If you want the game for zombies, get it on sale. For multiplayer, I'd pass honestly. If you want it for campaign, check other reviews, I have heard it is good though.GAME SCORE: 5.5/10"

												Playing Call of Duty: WWII is like going to a new Italian restaurant and ordering the same pizza you order from everywhere else. Maybe the crust is a bit different, or they have some neat sculpture in the corner of the room, or they play some nice music, but at the end of the day you know exactly what you're getting. And it's a tasty pizza, though it's smaller than you'd like; and there's a neat sculpture, though you've seen the same thing elsewhere; and the music's nice, though it's forgettable and blends into the conversastion. And you go home in a good mood, but when a friend asks you how it was, you can't remember much of it except ""yeah, 's alright.""In short: a fun few hours, but nothing you can't get in a hundred other places."

												I really wanted to like this game.I played call of duty 2 and world at war so much, mostly their campaigns. I don't play call of duty for the multiplayer, I play it for the campagin.So when I saw that they were making a new world war 2 game with a great looking campaign, I was very excited.Now let me make myself very clear, what I have played in the campaign was decent enoughI do not like the on rails section where you have to carry your wounded friend.But I do like the grand scope of the battles, especially of Omaha Beach. You really feel like your in hell, despite the cinematics that play before and even during the missionHOWEVER, I had to return this game because of the HORRIBLE optimization.I have a Evga Geforce Gtx 1080 FTW edition, an I7 7700k, 16 gb of DDR4 ram, and a Maximus IV motherboard.And yet there is still stuttering at times, and frame drops for no reason. This is ridiculous. It's so bad that there is even suttering on consoles as well, in which they clearly tried to optimize it for first. Activision, FIX YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥Oh and if you want to know aobut the multiplayer, its the same thing as everyother call of duty game, except now you can't double jump, depsite countless players jump shooting and dropping prone anyway.

All the campaigns were rather boring and easy, they got the uniforms wrong, the iconic MG42 had a ghastly slow rate of fire and even the iconic gun sounds weren't present. There was virtually no realism to the game, I mean come on Russian PPSH guns in Normandy. I used to be a huge Call of duty fan, and decided to give the game another chance but lets face it this franchise is going to flat line. Stick to Battlefield guys, you get more for your money, the graphics are amazing. Dice has put way more effort into this game than the Call of Duty scumbag devs. With massive battles you will have constant action, and hours of fun. Shortly new multiplayer maps will be released for Battlefield 1. Whats call of duty doing for its community apart from giving the middle finger and stealing our money."

												When I played my first few matches of COD: WW2 I thought this game was absolutely terrible, but after remapping a few keys, learning the maps a little, and some progression I finnally got the hang of the game and realised that this is a pretty decent COD. Theres a wide selection of guns (enough to satisfy my taste) and some of the skins I've gotten in loot drops are pretty cool. I don't recomend spending any money though on supply drops though. My only complaint for MP would be it seems like some Subs have nearly endless rannge, but I'm sure there will be a balancing update soon. Probably the best new addition to MP would be War mode. It seems like COD was barrowing a little from BF1 for inspiration but it felt different from Operations. Some of the maps seems a little unbalanced but not in such an overwhelming way where I feel like I can't win a match if I don't spawn on the right side of the map. Overall MP is a 7/10The campaign was actually really fun to me once I got past a few of the historical inaccuracies. I enjoyed fighting along my squad and felt like quite a few of the missions were greatly designed. There was a good mix of stealth and heavy fighting. The new health regeneration system added a nice touch of strategey to the game as well. Instead of just rushing through the mission shooting Nazis in the face, I was looking for my med packs and using cover. I'd rate the campaign a 7/10My favorite part of WW2 is the new Nazi Zombies mode. The map design, perks, Mods, class customization, and Raven progression take everything I felt was great from the previous Zombies modes and blended them together pretty well. The new look of the zombies is pretty scary honestly. I never played Infinite Or Advanced warfare's addition of zombies, so it's nice to get away from the same old characters and dogs. The easter egg and getting the telsa upgrades feels like a challange, but not an impossible one like I felt a few of the past Zombies modes have done. Zombies alone will probably get me to buy the season pass. It's a 9/10 and I feel where the game really shinesI would recomend buying this game if you're going to play all the game modes, it might seem a little underwhelming if you only play multiplayer or just zombies. All together this is a good game though. It feels like a step in the right direction though for the franchise. Though WW2 isn't the greatest Call of Duty of all time. it isnt the worst by any means. I'd give it a 7.6/10 overall."

												Mixed thoughts about this game.The single player was decent but I felt it was a bit short. They should have put more effort into the story and added more missions to complete. Just as I was getting into it, the game was pretty much over. Why not, with these ""DLCS"" release updated content for single player mode? More missions, a different story? I would rate the single player 5.5/10 Multiplayer is good most of the times, however there are too many cheaters and its putting me off the gameplay. Every third game or so there is a cheater and there is no sign of them getting banned (?) i've reported multiple over the course of time. I also feel there is VERY LITTLE multiplayer maps, it becomes a cycle and it gets boring very quickly.I've not followed the COD scene intensly except for CoD 2, CoD 4: Modern Warfare and CoD Modern Warfare Remastered. I only bought COD WW2 as I thought COD is finally going back to its roots, back to the intense and epic gameplay of COD 2..I would rate the multiplayer 6/10.Zombie mode was very fun at the start, but we finished it off very quickly.. I really enjoyed the experience and I thought they should have worked on more chapters, rather than releasing one per DLC..I would suggest to people to wait till they reduce the price, don't buy it now."

The soundtrack is a lot better than I expected, the graphics are great of course, the sound design is immersive, and oh man, the set pieces. This is what it feels like if you plugged a controller into a pile of money. I didn't experience any technical issues either. If you're just in it for the campaign like me, I say give it a try."

												Can't recommended this game to anyone looking for a good shooter to play. Its just another half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥COD port, with essentially no optimization and what feels like some strange input lag that I can not figure out the cause of. Expect all the crashes and bugs your heart desires. Campaign- Next to no content, 4 hours should get you through the entirety of the campaign. Completely unaccpetable for a $60.00 game. - Characters lack depth. - Vehicle controls are abhorrent and they feel like they were put into the game just to tick a box. Every single mission involving them is painful to play through and entirely unimaginative.  Multiplayer- Its COD, and you can tell. Weapons are very clearly balanced for console.- Matchmaking is quite poor. Most games i went into were a laggy mess despite living in the central US, with about 30-40% of the players having a one or two bar connection (Yay for ping bars, aren't we regressive?). - Framerate also seems to be capped at 60 in mutliplayer and that kind of defeats the purpose of having decent hardware and a 144 hz monitor, so if you want smooth multiplayer you wont find it here. Zombies- Truthfully, I did not play zombies so I can't comment on it."

It refuses to let me play full screen on my main monitor, I can't change the monitor it's on in the settings. If I click the ""monitor"" setting, it just takes me back to the main menu without having done anything. So I'm forced to play it in windowed mode on my prefered monitor.2.) Constantly crashes. I can only get to about 20 minutes of game time before the game just closes. It doesn't crash in the typical ""COD.exe has stopped working"" fashion. It just closes as if I ALT + F4 out of the game. My system is more than beefy enough to handle this game on max settings and has the latest Nvidia drivers. Uninstalling and reinstalling this game did nothing to fix these problems.

Buy the way EA you suck you ruin every game you make and or  take over. Glade it was a gift and not my money."

												Fov restricted by aspect ratio. Seriously?! Why not just go all the way and limit the framerate, have a fixed mouse sensitivity, lock the resolution and straight up copy paste the rest of the console verison with all its limitations?People got triggered by all the so called ""historical accuracy"". What gets my knickers in a twist is the ""Back to its roots""THE FIRST COD WAS A PROPER PC GAME TO BEGIN WITH YOU MORONS!"

												I have been a fan of the Call of Duty series since cod4 and for the majority of the time these games were great, after playing this game for a month, I am currently prestige 3, I have noticed a few things that could be improved on. First there are so many hackers in this game it is not even funny,  almost every game I loaded into had multiple hackers that just ruin the game for everybody. Second I have notice multiple bugs that must be fixed, One being not able to spawn into a game for minutes on end. Also Getting into the headquarters can take minutes to load, and when its done my game crashes. Another thing I noticed was that the double barrel shotgun and the cut off were very underpowered. Also this game is dry when it comes to new content, please add more weapon variants and less pistol grips. This would really make people grind more on this game. For now I am not recommending this game because I spent 100 dollars to get a game that I was promised would be good. Another thing I Noticed was that peope are looking past all the bad parts of this game because they want a boots on the ground classic cod, this is a major dissapointment, very sad, I hate to put down a game series that I love.

The campaign... well if you want a real D-Day battle where you actually get to do a Normandy attack, you will be disappointed.

												Cliff Notes:  Don't buy this game!Apparenly Call of Duty WW2 is akin to Pro Cycling, the sport.  That is, in order to compete, you must cheat.  Lance Armstrong once said that not cheating in Pro Cycling is like bringing a knife to a gun fight.  The same is true here.  Unfortunatly I do not want to brick my computer with the aimbot that nearly every player is using (activate-cod-ww2.exe) This aimbot cheat seems to be a gateway to get viruses on your PC via the updates.  The kids using the cheat do not care, their mommies bought them their 2 thousand dollar computer anyway.  The multiplayer is pretty much unusable without using this cheat or simmilar ones.  Every multiplayer match has a minumum of 4 cheaters every round.  I've been playing COD MP since Modern Warefare on the Xbox.  This is the first time I'm playing it on the PC and I can tell it was a mistake.  I have never seen this much cheating at this game.  I've seen a bit on MW2 and a bit more on Black Ops 3, but this game..... it takes the cake!It's not just the cheating either.  It took me 2 days to trouble shoot the graphics settings.  The auto calibrate feature does not work.  Even after I sussed out the graphics the framerate is still very bad in comparison to the Xbox360 and the XboxOne.  Again, I didn't get the XboxOne version because I thought, now that I have a nice gaming computer, I could ditch Xbox Live's 60.00 multiplayer ransom fee and play on here.  I guess I just can't.  At least, not with this game.I'm not a fan of George W.

												It's beyond♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's probably for me the worst Call Of Duty they have made ( Actually the exo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t was bad too ) I love the fact that it's WWII but the game is physically littered with hackers - CheckSpawning on small map is literally asking for you to get Cancer with the amount of spawn killing... - CheckCreated a shotgun with his too powerful as it, ♥♥♥♥ it let's slap fire damage to your first 4 shots so that in everygame so kid with no skill can just run around hit you once and be sure to get a kill. - CheckMade it the typical shoot a guy as much as you want he will still hit you with a spade, whether or not it is really close or he is so far away you scratch your head asking yourself ""How the ♥♥♥♥ did he hit me"" - CheckI think the only thing I like about this game is most likely zombies? but even then it's a struggle to have a decent enough team which will actually buy doors for you because they are incompetent little twerps wanting to get mystery box.And lasty due to it being christmas, all the little bratty kids got money and got WWII thus begins the Celebration of the Xmas Noobs are coming.The ONLY thing I actually like in this game is the new gamemode called War, which does not count your K/D but rather makes you play objective, let you use tanks, build walls ect... tho usually you get placed with some 100 hour fully prestiged master which will go on a rampage or with a full toxic team which can't figure out that you are suppose to cover an objective and not grab as many kills as possible"

												Movement is solid, reminds me of the older CoDs (still not as good as MW2 though).Sounds are good, not spectacular like Dice and Battlefield, but they are good.Killstreaks seems fair so far.I despite the new perk system though, that's a change for the worse.The Time To Kill is a lot higher than previous CoDs (at least it feels like). I'm getting up to 4 sometimes even 5 hit markers without the enemy dying, on only medium range. That's - once again - a change for the worse.Overall, it's an alright game. Not the best CoD, but absolutely not the worst. It's the best CoD to have been released in the last few years."

												I find it funny that most people start of their review with the whole ""Germans didn't use the PPSH! ZOMG!"" Okay... first off... more guns is better so Sssssssh. But also, there were ostruppen and such on the normandy beaches and it was used so... I mean not horribly bad they put it in there.NO, the game needs to die in a fire for FAR worse things. but I will mention the most painful to me..-""The Sherman can't pentrate the Panzer 4 frontal armor""... I mean first off, you fight them all like <50 meters close... a greyhound could probably pentrate it... but also.. yes it could. NOPE! Instead we have to play ring around the rosie with it to kill it with the ""Tiger"" which... I could create a whole new dot about but I'll just pretend it's GI ignorance (Though seriously that Tank could move for a ""tiger""!)-Headshots.. look I know all of us are getting to be just... epic levels of skill and seems to get headshots so easily that it's hard to balance you're Super Duper hardcore difficulty mode without making people have to shoot someone in the head twice... but I played and tested this on normal... It took 3 headshots to kill a normal soldier... why? Because it's was the fifth mission? Are the Nazi's litterally impoving their genetically manipulating their soldiers as the war goes on to resist death!? There are other ways to make the levels more difficulty (and don't me started on your laser sighted, only shooting at you, enemy soldiers vs friendly useless meatbags)-I don't care about your characters. Stop making your characters more boring... Have you played games like Brothers in Arms? I care about THOSE. They act realistically, they do things like real people... Just giving someone a Texan accent and saying some bad things about ""jews"" doesn't make me CARE. Give them character, let them die as randomly as the war really just seemed to do.. and I'll start pretending your stories are fun and engaging. Just please... please stop hiring whoever casts and directs this stuff...-Just don't talk about how GRAND WW2 was, with SO many countries, fought over SO many places... and then stick me with some Americans going through France and Germany. The original CoDs at least tried to show off the soviet eastern front. Is it too much to ask to have me be something other then an American Grunt? HECK! Maybe even just being a high ranking American officer!?! SEE we can compromise. You keep the America First, and I get to hear the war from a different perspective! Now I get to yell at all the Pvts and call them dirt! Maybe we can go back to italy some more? I don't know... would it kill to be part of the Polish 1st Armoured Division? Oh maybe we can be really exotic and play as a Canadian!-Slow the game down. As I qoute Rick McCallum, ""It's so dense, every single image has so many things going on."" No seriously, the star wars prequels sucked and so are these games! You can't even enjoy the good parts of it! Hey I just burned a Nazi let me just watch him die. Nope, Soldier keep fighting! Oh look the building collapsing kinda look nice let me just.. ""This ain't a cutscene! Keep moving forward or else!"" Hey wait which of my training buddies are with me, let me just check their na.. ""GRENADE THROW IT BACK."" Look Action becomes the boring NORM when you have no real breaks inbetween. If every second it the end of the world, then every second is the boring norm. I'm not worried of running out of ammo, of running of health, of picking the right cover, making the right moves. I'm just mindlessly shooting... over... and over... while moving foward.I want to say more but honestly... I need to go play some good fun ww2 games like Red Orchestra 2 to wash this filth out of my mind."

												The only thing that shines in the game is the Singleplayer. Hello Everyone and Welcome to Sir Jeffers Reviews. I happened to get a lot of time in on the multiplayer and zombies, but for the singleplayer, well I could play that all day if I really wanted to. The graphics actually look realistic in the singleplayer more so than the multiplayer. This review though is only based on what I thought of the multiplayer aspects and zombie mode. The multiplayer seems to be different for those who are used to jetpacks yatta yatta. We are heading back to WW2 and it feels nice for a change. I topped the leadboard on my first match with flame shotgun bullets. It was satisfying for sure. Although there is something that I do not like about this game, and it is the fact that they tried so hard to make this a game that would be played for hours on end, with amazing detail and what not. Unfortunately this game is not amazing and lacks a lot of graphical improvements and the optimization is just crap. I played on a 144hz monitor 2460 or 2K screen, with a 1080 graphics card and it didn't look all that great. The multiplayer is ok at best, but moving over to zombies, is just downright cringe worthy. The zombies look amazing art wise and their voices uncomfortable feeling which is great, but it just isn't as scary as we had hoped for the series. It has jump scares, but that is it. This Call of Duty, is by far an improvement for sure in some areas, but overall just isn't a game that I am interested diving more into. It was unfortunate because this was one of my anticipated game of this year, and it did not deliver to the hopes I thought it would bring."

												Honestly when I heard that they would be releasing WWII this year I was excited. I played the multiplayer mode and was not impressed. The single player campaign was good, but way too short. I finished it in under 6 hours. I really could care less about the multiplayer I just wanted a solid single player with more missions to learn a little more about the history. There's more to WWII than just invading Germany. That's what made the original COD series good, a great single player game. For multiplayer, I will admit I like Battlefield 1 much more.I'd recommend not wasting your time or money on this game. I wish I didn't."

												I find it funny that most people start of their review with the whole ""Germans didn't use the PPSH! ZOMG!"" Okay... first off... more guns is better so Sssssssh. But also, there were ostruppen and such on the normandy beaches and it was used so... I mean not horribly bad they put it in there.NO, the game needs to die in a fire for FAR worse things. but I will mention the most painful to me..-""The Sherman can't pentrate the Panzer 4 frontal armor""... I mean first off, you fight them all like <50 meters close... a greyhound could probably pentrate it... but also.. yes it could. NOPE! Instead we have to play ring around the rosie with it to kill it with the ""Tiger"" which... I could create a whole new dot about but I'll just pretend it's GI ignorance (Though seriously that Tank could move for a ""tiger""!)-Headshots.. look I know all of us are getting to be just... epic levels of skill and seems to get headshots so easily that it's hard to balance you're Super Duper hardcore difficulty mode without making people have to shoot someone in the head twice... but I played and tested this on normal... It took 3 headshots to kill a normal soldier... why? Because it's was the fifth mission? Are the Nazi's litterally impoving their genetically manipulating their soldiers as the war goes on to resist death!? There are other ways to make the levels more difficulty (and don't me started on your laser sighted, only shooting at you, enemy soldiers vs friendly useless meatbags)-I don't care about your characters. Stop making your characters more boring... Have you played games like Brothers in Arms? I care about THOSE. They act realistically, they do things like real people... Just giving someone a Texan accent and saying some bad things about ""jews"" doesn't make me CARE. Give them character, let them die as randomly as the war really just seemed to do.. and I'll start pretending your stories are fun and engaging. Just please... please stop hiring whoever casts and directs this stuff...-Just don't talk about how GRAND WW2 was, with SO many countries, fought over SO many places... and then stick me with some Americans going through France and Germany. The original CoDs at least tried to show off the soviet eastern front. Is it too much to ask to have me be something other then an American Grunt? HECK! Maybe even just being a high ranking American officer!?! SEE we can compromise. You keep the America First, and I get to hear the war from a different perspective! Now I get to yell at all the Pvts and call them dirt! Maybe we can go back to italy some more? I don't know... would it kill to be part of the Polish 1st Armoured Division? Oh maybe we can be really exotic and play as a Canadian!-Slow the game down. As I qoute Rick McCallum, ""It's so dense, every single image has so many things going on."" No seriously, the star wars prequels sucked and so are these games! You can't even enjoy the good parts of it! Hey I just burned a Nazi let me just watch him die. Nope, Soldier keep fighting! Oh look the building collapsing kinda look nice let me just.. ""This ain't a cutscene! Keep moving forward or else!"" Hey wait which of my training buddies are with me, let me just check their na.. ""GRENADE THROW IT BACK."" Look Action becomes the boring NORM when you have no real breaks inbetween. If every second it the end of the world, then every second is the boring norm. I'm not worried of running out of ammo, of running of health, of picking the right cover, making the right moves. I'm just mindlessly shooting... over... and over... while moving foward.I want to say more but honestly... I need to go play some good fun ww2 games like Red Orchestra 2 to wash this filth out of my mind."

												This is a SP review only, Im not a good enough MP player to give a fair review of that.The SP campaign mission feels quite dull, every CoD SP ive played has always pulled me in and made me want to play, so much that ive done it on all difficulty levels, but CoD WII hasnt done that, half the time I feel bored, its not the setting cause the original 2 CoD games I loved, dunno its just boring.   The tank controls (when you get to drive one) are dumb as ♥♥♥♥, keyboard should control the tank movement and the mouse should control the turret, but no you spend more time spinning like a top cause the tank wants to go where your looking, its made it unplayable especially as youve got to drive round trying to get behind a tank that has been buffed for effect (the effect of making you want to quit).My wife bought me this for christmas, Ive really gotta stop getting games as gifts cause it feels like a wasted gift when the games this awful."

												So i've been with the CoD franchise since the first game was released years ago. That being said, this game makes me wonder what the developers were trying to accomplish. The campaign feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and is easily beaten in under 2-3 hours of gameplay with no real replay value unless you like the cutscenes. And the multiplayer is a joke. I bought a geforce 1070 just so i could play games like this and simply cant with this pile of garbage. The single player campaign lagged harder than any game i have ever played online and forget about playing online multiplayer. The game is so optimized that even with the graphics set for low and most of the options off i still barely hit 100 fps when i am by myself on the screen, throw in some other players and the counter drops to under 60. Overall this was a poorly done reboot of the first game they made. The only thing that keeps me from refunding is zombie mode."

												It's beyond♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's probably for me the worst Call Of Duty they have made ( Actually the exo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t was bad too ) I love the fact that it's WWII but the game is physically littered with hackers - CheckSpawning on small map is literally asking for you to get Cancer with the amount of spawn killing... - CheckCreated a shotgun with his too powerful as it, ♥♥♥♥ it let's slap fire damage to your first 4 shots so that in everygame so kid with no skill can just run around hit you once and be sure to get a kill. - CheckMade it the typical shoot a guy as much as you want he will still hit you with a spade, whether or not it is really close or he is so far away you scratch your head asking yourself ""How the ♥♥♥♥ did he hit me"" - CheckI think the only thing I like about this game is most likely zombies? but even then it's a struggle to have a decent enough team which will actually buy doors for you because they are incompetent little twerps wanting to get mystery box.And lasty due to it being christmas, all the little bratty kids got money and got WWII thus begins the Celebration of the Xmas Noobs are coming.The ONLY thing I actually like in this game is the new gamemode called War, which does not count your K/D but rather makes you play objective, let you use tanks, build walls ect... tho usually you get placed with some 100 hour fully prestiged master which will go on a rampage or with a full toxic team which can't figure out that you are suppose to cover an objective and not grab as many kills as possible"

												After years of COD failing to delivery, I had finally gotten the nerve to try-out SHG's latest installment into the Call of Duty franchise. When I did, I actually had quite a bit of fun playing the game on both its several Multiplayer modes and its AWESOME ZOMBIES gamemode (which IMHO rivals treyarc's Zombies). However, this 'fun' was very far in between as the game actually rarely worked. Random crashes on my HIGH-END PC and extreme connection issues (which P2P servers DO NOT help with at all) completely spoiled any sort of fun that was to be found. Which is extremely dissapointing, as again the game itself is lot of fun, and to be honest, the first time I've actually enjoyed a COD since 2012's Black Ops 2.Like most people, I fell into the trap of believing some previous issues may have been addressed. That the connection problems and the terrible PC performances of the previous COD's might have changed. Unfortuantly, myself, along with many others have been tricked yet again. The day Activision and its three studios (Treyarc, Infinityward, Sledgehammer Games) treat the PC community with the attention it deserves by introducing DEDICATED servers and a proper PC port, will be the day I might consider putting down another $60USD into the 'former' juggernaught that is Call of Duty."

												I have played CoD since United Offensive and I really looked forward to this one since it was going back to it's roots in World War 2. I played the beta and it played well but now that the game is live the BIGGEST issue I have is anytime you play MP or Zombie the game lag makes the game completly unplayable. My internet is not the issue as I have a 30 meg down and 5 meg up speed and am running 4 gig of video ram along with 16 gig of pc ram. I have tried to give the game a chance and was really looking forward to the Zombie mod (Which is a LOT of fun to play if you can play unlagged)  and a couple of the MP modes but with crappy game connection it's just unplayable. I should of asked for a refund after the first day but wanted to give it a chance and for Sledgehammer to fix the issues but still no fix and game play is crappy."

												First of all i was so hyped for this game that i bought the deluxe edition from day one it was ready for prepurchase.  After playing the campaign, tried the zombie mode which was a big dissapointment due to the non-existing servers.  I get online and the lag is real.  I shoot a zombie and after 2 secs i see the shot.  Its like this with everyone cause ive talked with few people during the gaming sessions.  Furthermore, the multiplayer sucks.  First of all, the maps are too big and you are too open whenever you go either inside the house or outside there are 18 different angles to get shot and as a result during my over 60 online matches only 7 times somebody got a killstreak.  Moreover,  3 out of 5 times am trying to play online the servers wont connect.  Biggest dissapointment of all time.  I would be embarrassed being one of the developers of the game seriously due to the fact that i lied AGAIN (activision) to my community and also released a game that needs at least 3 more months in development, at least their servers.

												I give it a solid ""Meh""Rating (6/10) maybe 7/10 ---based on Activision's development capability vs. what they actually developed with Call of Duty: WWII. They didn't add anything new to the franchise.The OFFLINE: It's a very pretty game but the offline is too short and doesn't tell much of a story. They're probably going to release multfiple WWII games from different theaters of the War. At least that's what I think they're doing...if not then this is  a poorly executed attempt at bringing back the old (and frankly, more popular) CoDs. (IMPORTANT NOTE) Pick your online name wisely because you can't change it. They make you create a new account and you can't carry over acheivements, levels...or anything. Maybe I'm wrong but I haven't figured it out yet.The ONLINE: Is OK. They released the game with too few maps and I'm guessing that's because they're looking to make money on the DLC map packs. That sort of goes without saying, I just figured they'd give their customers a bit more for their money. I've heard a few folks grumbling about it. The maps they released are pretty good though - my only gripe is that there are invisivble barriers everywhere you'd think you'd be able to perch yourself. Other than that, the map layout and design lends itself to a decent dynamic gameplay. Player movement seems to have increased slightly and it makes the game a bit hectic at times. It's not uncommon to spawn and die within a few secocds. The damage hit boxes are weird. I don't know what's going on but I've side-stepped a fully automatic smg until they're out of ammo, and conversely, I've fired a shot at a target who was sitting squarely in my crosshairs, and never got the hit marker or kill. It can be a bit frustrating when you're trying to use a bolt-action rifle (or any gun for that matter).It's not as much of strantgey based game as it is a run and gun ""whoever has the better internet connection"" wins.  I'm enjoying being back in the realm of conventional (boots on the ground) type gameplay. That being said this game didn't add anything new to the franchise and needs some help. They could have done A LOT more to make this game a masterpiece.Before I bought Call of Duty: WWII I was waiting for the next Black Ops or Modern Warfare level of development and playability - I'm still waiting for that development. ZOMBIES: I played zombies briefly and it's probably the best part about this game if you have some friedns to play it with."

Just a soldier in WWII. I mean a mouse in a field isn't surprising or overly interesting, so neither is a soldier in a war withouth any story of substence.- Cookie Cutter / Template-Based isn't really acceptable to a market these days. A highly polished turd is still a turd at the end of things. Just like this re-hashed WW2 war drama doesn't add anything new or special worthy of a $50.00US price tag.

Wrong. I do have to give the campaign some credit as the look and feel was pretty cool, but who buys COD for just the campaign?"

												this game is basically unplayable on pc. i don't understand why i can run a game like battlefield 1 with almost 10x the amount of things happening but call of duty barely touches my gpu and relies mainly on my cpu causing huge instability issues. the campaign is literally unplayable and the multiplayer is barely playable. for 60 dollars i would've expected better and it's nowhere near as optimized as the beta was. I had no problems running the beta but the full game barely works. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME"

												    This game is complete SJW trash. Black female nazis, the Iron Cross replacing what little Swastikas there are, and LGBT flag calling cards. Let's not forget Michael Condrey, a developer who's likely pushed all these changes and has shown very clear support for the historical inaccurate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t listed above. I had more fun in the beta then I did the actual game, even though most guns were broke to♥♥♥♥♥♥ There is a ton of balancing issues in the full game, as well, especially with a lot of the newer maps. (Which are bland and poorly designed)     The campaign seems to be no different from the multiplayer, with very careful use of the Swastika. I can hardly call what the Germans wear in the first mission historically accurate at all, as it seems to just be giant blobs of gray. The gameplay sucks♥♥♥♥♥as well, so if you're in it for the campaign I suggest just watching someone else play through this garbage.    I haven't bothered playing zombies, because I honestly don't want that to be ruined for me, but from what I've seen the lighting and map design (for some of the maps, others are pretty good) is pretty horrendous. I refrain from calling it Nazi Zombies because the most fascism you'll find is in the uniforms, which again, don't have a hint of Nazi memorabilia on them. I'd say zombies is the best part of this game, but that's just my opinion.    I won't make this too long, as I am eager to refund this, but my point is the game has been pushed by an SJW agenda, and it shows in the most negative ways possibly. Sledgehammer's incompetence has shown throughout all the games they've made, and it really shows here. Please, don't give Sledgehammer any money and avoid this title."

Just a soldier in WWII. I mean a mouse in a field isn't surprising or overly interesting, so neither is a soldier in a war withouth any story of substence.- Cookie Cutter / Template-Based isn't really acceptable to a market these days. A highly polished turd is still a turd at the end of things. Just like this re-hashed WW2 war drama doesn't add anything new or special worthy of a $50.00US price tag.

Besides that, Im never buying another COD release after this. Complete let down, and they really made me feel like a complete idiot actually being axcited for this. Never again. (to make it even worse of an experience, I literally had to sit through 5 min. of cinematics on the campaign just to write this review, because the crappy dev's dont let you skip cut scenes to play the damn game.

												In few words: Simply bad, regret getting Deluxe edition....Out of all CoD series i've played so far, this was the worst of them all.This review is about Multiplayer, not the campaign or zombies. I heard the campaign is fun from my friends though.What are the pro's?: -Old fashioned game style design (Duh! Wolrd War 2 theme)-Designed for slow paced action. Some map are designed for sniping and others for camping or mix gamestyle.-Objects animation (When you shoot a vehicle tires, you can flatten it)What are the cons?:-Can't post review on this game until you played the campaign mode for longer than 5 minutes while you have hours on Multiplayer WW2...-Level system balance with default loadout. You basically have disadvantage against players higher level who possibly have more progress in each division class than your own. Each division class have 4 ""Perks"" and you can add 1 Basic Training "" perk"". You can mix and match this to your liking, but only limited to people who have quite a few levels to do so and progress. For example, if you are level 55 and haven't unlocked Mountain Division stage 4, but your opponent did at low level already, that person got ""Deadsilence"" at stage 4 while you make tons of sound.-Movements are really clunky.-Only 2 spawn area. Even if 1-2 enemies are in your spawnzone, you still end up spawning in your own zone until more comes closer to your spawn location to flip it.-Hitbox are extremely large in some cases. Shot down uav with bazooka without aiming at the uav. No auto-lock on.-Weapon balance in HC is another issue. Pistol is 1 shot while all other guns requires more than 3 shot. LMG takes 2+shot even at close range. SMG takes 3 shot.-Access to daily mission, requires you to go to HQ to talk to npc to get them. You must load that map in order to do so. about 30seconds wasted in doing so...-Lootbox from match, doesn't appear in your lootbox list at all even though aftermatch said you got one crate at top 3 winner team screen.-Lootbox content, sometimes you get Heroic ""gun"" but cannot find that gun. Not sure if gun or cammo, Can't find it either way.--------------------Edit for update 14 nov 2017:Pro's:-Fixed server lags by going through dedicated servers, but its still there.-balanced certain guns, not all. Shotgun can shoot extremely long range. Way to OP in HC due to spread 1 shot kill.-not much of clunky movements left to be seen.-heroic skin can be found now.-lobby lootcrate now adds properly to your lootcrate counter.Cons:-still messed up spawn system-Still no anti-cheat system.-No bans being handed out to blatant cheaters so far.-No theater mode"

												So I've only been able to play it for the first hour or so into the game. This is a technical review and I might update it later when Sledgehammer Games patch it. On the campaign side, it's fun so far but the graphics could have been more impressive. Honestly, I don't mind at this point since the issue isn't with the gameplay mechanics (minus the annoying QTEs. Oh what fun getting killed over and over again because the game keeps switching the button you need to press for the QTE) and story so much as the technical aspect. So even though I was getting 60+ FPS, my CPU and GPU start to run at 100% after the first hour of the game. Would have overheated and melted the PC if I didn't exit the game. With that in mind, I can't recommend the game in its current state. If you look in the discussions and technical reviews, many other people have issues as well. My specs are up to par if you have to ask:Intel Core i5 Skylake 6400 2.7 GHzASUS Strix Geforce GTX 970 OC 4 GB VRAMRAM 16 GBWIndows 10 HomeEven after maxing out settings, it only used 2.7 GB of VRAM, but obviously doesn't mean much when the card and CPU cores are maxed out and overheating. I should mention I NEVER had ANY other game do this. I can run Crysis 3, GTA V, Metro Redux Last Light, Battlefield 1, and Hitman with no problems. As of right now, you're taking a risk if you buy this game on the assumption that it may or may not even work for you, and if it does, no guarantee that you'll be able to play it without any problems. Those who did were lucky enough to do so and therefore made a positive review. But as you can tell, that does little to change the overall reviews. Activision managed to ♥♥♥♥ up even more. At least all my other CODs WORK without issues. 11/10 Would overheat PC again."

												I got this game based soley off of the fact that I played CoD2 for many hours on xFire and loved everything to do with Cod:UO and CoD2. I was really excited when the Developers said ""Realism"" and figured that they would be going back to Giant maps with 32 vs 32 or something similar. The most they mange is 12 vs 12. Even then the map size is small. Day one DLC, ""realism"", small game/map size, Only 6 hours of campaign, spray and pray tactics. All these contribute to a pretty bad experience. If you like the last few Call of duty's, then go ahead this is a refreshing new Activision game. But you should probably should wait until it's on sale.If you want realism, buy Red Orchestra/Rising storm 2. It was better made and still has pretty good graphics. Also way cheaper and has a level up system as well that doesn't make you feel like you're cheesing the game. (Went from level 2 to 5 in one game of CoD WWII with 6 kills and 14 deaths.)"
"Posted: November 6, 2017",Not Recommended,8.7 hrs on record,"Posted: November 6, 2017
												TL;DR: The sum of its mediocrity is unsurprisingly mediocre. 4.5/10 Do Noy Buy unless on sale.Campaign: Its alright, very cliche, to an almost parody degree. Recycled WW2 movie shots, story beats, and just about every other CoD game made. Its OK. 5/10Multiplayer: The term awkward comes to mind. Time to Kill on guns is either instantanious, or just a moment too long, even when being shot you will feel for a moment after death like it should have graced you a moment before.   Maps - enerally too large w/ large sidelines for snipers, or too too cramped still somehow favoring snipers.   Divisions - A nice, and fresh addition to the game, though you can't help but feel like they were afraid to go too all-in on the idea of a Division being truly specialized into a single weapon type. Expidtionary gets Dragon's Breath shotgun shells, cool. Beyond this everything else focuses on Tactical and Lethal equipment. Why? Why not double down on the idea and have the entier division's perks benefit shotguns? Lvl 1 Dragon's Breath, Lvl 2 Slight of Hand, Lvl 3 Lightweight, Lvl 4, Marathon. It would make Divisions feel like a more important addition to the game that way, and give you difficult choices to make when opting to take a non-Division weapon into battle. Love the lightweight nature of Expidtionary and the Slight of Hand? Love SMGs? Great, but kiss your silencer goodbye. Instead we are left with a good idea falling short. (The sort of overall theme here.) Overall, falls short and its a damn shame 3/10Zombies: It certainly looks...pretty? It has a distinct polished grungyness to it at least. Plays like you'd expect, bravo on that much. The journal to keep track of the complex steps to ""win"" is also a welcome feature. Overall, plays like zombies, with an aesthetic that's unique in its own way. 6/10 for adding a journal and defined objective.Overall Score: 4.5/10 Its just not worth it. It falls flat in almost every way possible, with the only surprising saviour being Zombies. If you can catch the game for $30 or just really love CoD, consider it. If not, skip the game and save yourself the trouble"

												I haven't played the campaign yet, but let me assure you.Multiplayer is broken  (don't let that .1 hrs of play fool you - I've put in 20hrs+ on multiplay).There is nothing fun about this game unless you're a mouse-using scope sniper.   The game is leveled completely AGAINST controllers.  Keep your ""PC gaming is done with a mouse and keyboard"" comments to yourself.  I come to PC for gaming for CHOICES.  Needless to say - don't buy if you're a controller user.Learn to cheat.  Or at least exploit the goofy SH*T that Sledgehammer felt we just HAD to have.Hit detection appears to be out the window.  Watch some Bronze Star replays and see how many victims die WITHOUT actually being hit with bullets when shot at.Cheaters are still there.  Sledgehammer can talk smack all they want about helping the PC gamer - but the cheaters are still aimbotting.The UI is a COMPLETE AND UTTER MESS.  Spend your first five hours trying to find where they stashed menu items.  The game clearly wasn't finished when they released it - causing all sorts of issues, bugs, glitches .. I didn't pay almost $100 to be your goddamn beta testers.The HQ system is an abortion.  The load times because of it are a nightmare.  I shouldn't have to have the latest M2 drives to prevent excessive load times.I'll admit that matchmaking seems to work most of the time.The game is overall set to punish you for the first 20 levels of play by locking guns with any chances of competing behind high levels and loot boxes.  Be easier to just let early players throw rocks at the top brass - it has the same effect.Zombies?  Yeah ok - as usual, it is the best part of a COD package - but it ain't no Zombies in Spaceland.  The objective based play gets a nod - but you can't see crap half the time - even cranking the gamma.  Tesla guns (an integral part of the game) obscures your vision so you don't even WANT to use it.This is the most MISERABLE multiplayer COD ... I'd say, of all time.  Damn shame.  They should have just remastered COD World At War.  Would have been a better game.Let's hope the campaign is worth $100.Get this game for $14 when it hits some gray market key shop.  Paying full price here?  A huge mistake."

												I absolutely would've wanted to give this game a positive review, but currently, I definitely can't.The campaign was actually decent fun, with alright characters and plot, even though it was a bit underwhelming at times, especially the D-Day mission, where the sound really was just horrible, with the landing being almost quiet. Overall, it was pretty good. I can't really talk about Zombies since I've probably played it for just about half an hour. Seems okay, but definitely not on par with Treyarch's Zombies. Now the Multiplayer. The Beta was quite fun, and it still would be, even more so probably, if it weren't plagued by problems. The combat is good, similar to other recent Call of Duty titles, only quite a bit slower paced thankfully because of the lack of jetpacks. Personally I don't mind the lack of the Pick 10 system, the Divisions are quite alright, so I don't have anything to complain about that. The maps though really don't feel too thought out, the best ones probably being the ones that were included in the Beta. Now there's the issues: the game is just not polished, being filled with neverending bugs like not receiving Supply Drops which I should have gotten; Orders and Contracts not working properly; getting disconnected from matches; resetting classes; optimisation problems with terrible stutters at times even on low settings, with my CPU usage being constantly capped at 100% for no apparent reason (not a hardware problem, I've got an overclocked 4670K with an R9 290, being able to run Battlefield 1 smoothly on ultra settings, a much more graphically advanced title); hackers, which were supposed to be adressed since the beta, but you can still find them, after not even 2 weeks since the launch; spawns being horrible, constantly having enemies spawn right behind me; and the netcode, or the connection in general (which is still P2P currently) which is absolutely laughable, it's just sh*tty and there's no nicer way to put it.In short, it's a good game but it's just got so many problems that take away from the fun you should have. Let's just hope that Sledgehammer will iron them out quickly, but until then, my review will remain negative."

												I haven't played the campaign yet, but let me assure you.Multiplayer is broken  (don't let that .1 hrs of play fool you - I've put in 20hrs+ on multiplay).There is nothing fun about this game unless you're a mouse-using scope sniper.   The game is leveled completely AGAINST controllers.  Keep your ""PC gaming is done with a mouse and keyboard"" comments to yourself.  I come to PC for gaming for CHOICES.  Needless to say - don't buy if you're a controller user.Learn to cheat.  Or at least exploit the goofy SH*T that Sledgehammer felt we just HAD to have.Hit detection appears to be out the window.  Watch some Bronze Star replays and see how many victims die WITHOUT actually being hit with bullets when shot at.Cheaters are still there.  Sledgehammer can talk smack all they want about helping the PC gamer - but the cheaters are still aimbotting.The UI is a COMPLETE AND UTTER MESS.  Spend your first five hours trying to find where they stashed menu items.  The game clearly wasn't finished when they released it - causing all sorts of issues, bugs, glitches .. I didn't pay almost $100 to be your goddamn beta testers.The HQ system is an abortion.  The load times because of it are a nightmare.  I shouldn't have to have the latest M2 drives to prevent excessive load times.I'll admit that matchmaking seems to work most of the time.The game is overall set to punish you for the first 20 levels of play by locking guns with any chances of competing behind high levels and loot boxes.  Be easier to just let early players throw rocks at the top brass - it has the same effect.Zombies?  Yeah ok - as usual, it is the best part of a COD package - but it ain't no Zombies in Spaceland.  The objective based play gets a nod - but you can't see crap half the time - even cranking the gamma.  Tesla guns (an integral part of the game) obscures your vision so you don't even WANT to use it.This is the most MISERABLE multiplayer COD ... I'd say, of all time.  Damn shame.  They should have just remastered COD World At War.  Would have been a better game.Let's hope the campaign is worth $100.Get this game for $14 when it hits some gray market key shop.  Paying full price here?  A huge mistake."

												I was hyped since the announcement and I bought it on a whim. After playing for less than 1h in both, singleplayer and multiplayer, I realized that the only good thing that this game has is that it reminds me of how great other games that I played were... Basically a ""go play CoD, CoD:United Offensive, CoD2 and... Left4Dead"" reminder. I cannot say they didn't put effort in this game but they certainly have lost what attracted most of the fans back in the early 2000's with the mentioned titles of the franchise. This game has not surpassed any of the titles here mentioned in any ""gaming"" way, still is good to prepare some popcorn and watch it as an ""expensive movie"" if you are bored with everything else.In my opinion, the single player is lifeless. I don't care about cinematics or graphics in general. I want to feel the pressure to survive, to commit mistakes, be able to choose how to reach and tackle and objective, while feeling different every time. Not having Co-op in the campaign is a big sin nowadays, knowing most of the people buy this game to enjoy with their friends the experience of going through the ""war"" together... Dumb scripted♥♥♥♥♥♥ not worth it.The multiplayer is not meant for 50% of the people that purchased this game and come from the aforementioned background. This game wants to attract buyers of the old titles and then proposed them the multiplayer of the new ones... they don't realized that most of them don't like it, they wanted to revive the old multiplayer, with big open maps, vehicles, meaningful objectives, more slow paced and tactical multiplayer where people can react and have time to think about the strategy... I really missed the times when I was defending a church in the town of Foy with my mates and we really could see from all angles, all the tanks coming to destroy us, should we abandon the town or just defend it? do we have enough people with explosives? is it worth it? should we charge at their bunkers now? do we have enough vehicles to exit the town safely? Old thoughts... I personally, stopped buying CoD games after MW1 and I hoped this one will revive the franchise. It didn't.Nevertheless, if you like graphics and cinematics before gameplay and replayability, you like playing multiplayers in rampaging mode, with little time to react or comprehend what's happening in a mayhem ""quake"" style jumping simulator and cramped maps. This is your game, not mine."

												(pre-note I put 53 hours into the call of duty ww2 multiplayer)I usually hate call of duty because it is copy and paste. Anyone who knows me personally knows I hate call of duty with a passion but this year I decided to pick up a cod game when it comes out. After playing extensively I actually like this years call of duty. The Campaign is mediocre I wouldn't touch it. But the Multiplayer and zombies is where it's at. So far it isn't pay to win with supply drops it is just cosmetics which is nice.  The Multiplayer,For the most part it is fun. You have the generic TDM,DOM, etc. The only real modes worth playing is Search and Destroy and the new War mode that is basically Rush from Battlefield. The weapons preform nice, the ""division"" system is alright nothing special it's a nice addition. But some of the weapon inaccurcies bother me. The m1 garand is not supposed to have a magazine and the reload animation is so painfully inaccurate it hurts to watch from someone who loves world war 2. Other than that the modes are nice when you have a comptent team. Just wish there were more than 3 or 4 maps for war mode.  The maps are well done as well. The amount of detail is insane. I found ""kilroy was here"" on a couple walls on different maps so that is a nice nod.Zombies,The zombies prologue is nice and sets up the zombies for the one zombie map. I think there should have been 3 or 4 zombie maps but the two is alright for now. The zombie easter egg is pretty cool as well. Me myself have not completed but I have gotten close and it's a blast with friends. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in this game over some games like star wars battlefront 2 where it is clearly pay to win."

												Reviewed after 86 hours in Mulitplayer (fired up single player just to be able to write review)AN UNBELIEVALBE AMOUNT OF HACKERSMAPS SO TINY AND SIMPLE THEY MAKE FREE TO PLAY SHOOTER MAPS LOOK GREATLAG AND SPIKES BEYOND BELIEF IN THEIR ""SO CALLED"" DEDICATED SERVERSHowever....The idea was good and it was nice to go back to WWII.The Headquarters was kind of a nifty idea even if it is very small and not much to do.As of now I don't mind the care packages because the only guns you seem to get are variations of existing guns that are the same stat-wise but give you an XP boost an a bit of visual flare.  So opening some crates is exciting sometimes. Sadly there's just too many cons to keep this game from being enjoyable.Map design is horrible.  And I mean HORRIBLE.  These are the smallest maps I've ever played in my 35 years of PC gaming.  There was more map design that went into COMBAT for the Atari 2600 than these.  Plus there's just not enough maps either.  What makes it worse for me is that I hate half of what is offered already (Texas, Aachen, Gustav, and Saint Marie)The hackers are unbelievable right now.  It's about a 20% chance of getting a clean lobby now.  The beta was so hacked that PC Gamer did an article called ""aimbots galore"" on it.  By the 3rd day of the beta it was impossilbe to find a clean match so you can imagine what the full release is like.  PUBG has already banned 700,000 players (you read that right, seven hundered thousand players).  COD has done nothing for it's players and community as far as bans.  So like every other COD it will devolve down into a small player base of the ""hardcore"" fans and the other 70% will be hackers that freely ruin the game for everyone.  My bet is they will do like they've done for the past 7 years and wait until just before a DLC launch before doing any kind of a ban wave (witht he exception of the BLOPS series who did a good job of attempting to ban)The ""dedicated servers"" are serious crap (if there is actually any servers.)  I 'd swear this is completely P2P with all the constant lag spikes and freezing durning a match.This series has been completely outshown for years now by the Battlefield, Battlefront games.  Both graphically and in sound design.  Huge battles that have amazing looking maps with tons of players and it all runs at a solid frame rate.  sigh.... If only COD would actually up it's game.  Make some larger maps like you used to, put a few more players in like you used to, be active when it comes to trying to curb the hacker population..... just do......SOMETHING.....ANYTHING FOR CRYING OUT LOUD  For years now it's been getting smaller minded and little to no effort into it's PC communty. Bottom line:  This is probably a great game on consoles but on PC it's complete trash."

Product received for free
 Don't buy it, save your money!I received this game as a gift and played it with an open mind, completely ignoring the reviews. I played single player and quite enjoyed it, but there was nothing extraordinary about the campaign. Just a good story line with same old COD mechanics. However what really bugged me were the long cut scenes. Starting the game, I had to wait 20 mins just to even move my character! I know it's the drama and the story, but come on! I want to play the game not just watch it. And when it came to tank and plane controls, they were horrendous. Absolutely terrible! I am disappointed and annoyed even though I received this game for free, I wouldn't even think of spending 60 Euros for it. And what I found more surprising was that many ""mainstream"" reviewers have not even mentioned the control problems in their reviews, which makes me think whether they were paid reviews.And this is coming from a person who was a huge fan of MW, MW2 and Black Ops. Didn't purchase the latter games as I knew they were milking the same old idea and gameplay."

												Gave each mode a try.Single player:- Your AI teammates have magic ice bullets that do no damage- The enemy has a fanatic obsession with you, and no one else- The enemy are all highly trained marksmen who have no issue standing up under intense gunfire and waiting for you to come out of cover (see ice bullet note above)Multiplayer:- Just another frantic 'run and gun' lobby shooter that (appears to) lack any real depth. If you're into this genre, then it's perfect. If you wish people took some time to play to a strategy, you will be disappointed.+ Social lobby is definitely a cool feature (Destiny style, but with more than 16 people). Social space has tons of utilities (the gun range is a huge QOL feature)+ New game mode (war) is lots of fun! Good change of pace from the boring TDM tediumMultiplayer - Zombies:+ New zombie units are a nice change of pace+ Definitely gives the 'run for you life' thrill- Hard to find doors or objectives on the map. Many times you'll just be running around trying to look for things that are out of place. Wish the UI showed you what the objectives were before the match startedI say ""no"" to recommend, only because of my personal preference. If you enjoy hectic run-and-gun shooters, this will be fine for you."

												I don't think this game is perfect or innovative honestly, but I've had a lot of fun playing it and this is coming from someone who rarely plays games anymore. With work and school in the way I've been really limited the last year or so from playing games, but I still try to put in a few hours here and there. I get that a lot of people are upset that this game has major historical inaccuracies, which I totally understand. I am a bit annoyed by the red dot sights and Germans wearing American helmets and stuff like that. But as someone who isn't picky enough to let that ruin my entire experience, I still am enjoying this game quite a bit. I haven't even touched the campaign yet, but I put a few hours into the war mode which is absolutely awesome. The objective-based modes are really good in my opinion, and they feel like they are fresh. Kills are important but they don't affect your K/D in War Mode, and everything is based around helping your team succeed. This is a really nice change, and I've had really intense moments with my friends on this mode already. Zombies is scary as hell. The jump scares don't seem to get old to me and there is a lot more diversity in the enemies you fight. I won't spoil anything, but it is a really good time. The lack of maps is my biggest complaint here, and every Call of Duty in the past that I've played had this same issue. Even going back to World at War and Black Ops (the best Zombies in my opinion), the base games were really limited and you needed a bunch of DLCs to get all the maps. This definitely is my biggest gripe, and as a casual gamer (definitely used to be hardcore but I don't have time for that anymore) I think this is legitimately upsetting. With that being said, I enjoyed the little prologue mission and the map itself is pretty well-done with a lot of tight hallways and corners that will have you clenching your mouse/controller as you sprint through them.Multiplayer in general is pretty similar to the older Call of Duty games, and it plays pretty similarly to Black Ops or World at War. I think MW2 definitely had better multiplayer than this game, but I wouldn't call this multiplayer inherently ""bad"". I am personally enjoying it, and I like the new game modes as well as the familiar older ones. I've skipped out on the last couple CODs, and I feel like I haven't missed anything because of this. The gameplay doesn't feel that innovative, but I don't know if I liked COD's innovative approach. Innovative to them was going way into the future and flipping everything on its head with jump packs and wall running, which was just stupid to me. I didn't even get Black Ops 3, and I had always been a huge Treyarch fan in the past. I actually agree with the decision to play it safe and go with what COD does well, because this gives fans a product that works and is more fun to play.I think there are a lot of people that want this game to be terrible, but I don't think it is. I wouldn't call WWII game of the year by any means, but its been quite a few years since COD has been anywhere close to that title. All I can say is I'm having a lot of fun so far, and I'd suggest doing your research to decide for yourself before you buy this game."

												DO NOT BUY THIS.  Iam Not jokeing I played abit of ONLY the story I ran into issues Like Degradeing Audio meaning Over time I started hearing Crackling Noises I thought it was my Headset at first But it was Not after i did a sound check. That happen 3 times i Had relaunch the game to fix it.  ON TOP of that i had Frame rate issues Even thow I have Vsync on and Running. And lets not forget there is HIT dection issues where i would be 0 point blank on the enamys And Shoot them ONLY FOR NOTHING TO HAPPEN! all of this in the STORY part of the game.  I Havent even touched Multiplayer and from what i saw in a Live stream ppl was saying the Servers was down on launch across all platforms !  With ONLY a FEW who actuly got to play.  Worst Part Iam Trying to get a Refund for this game and steam Does Not want to Honor the Refund. So I may Not be able to get my money back BUT I hope to save you all some Money DO NOT BUY THIS! We Should not fund Companys for games that are Not Finished or broken only to wait for patchs to fix there damn Mistakes!  And STEAM shame on you for not Honoring a refund for a BROKEN GAME if it was a issue on my side of things that i could fix i wouldn't stress and i would try to fix it but its NOT its the game. and for a MAJOR company that Sells games the support is crap."

												What a let down... WOW was I hyped for this one. Pre-loaded a week early and everything. I even watched Band of Brothers counting down the days til release. But wow oh wow. I didnt know it was possible for a triple  A title to have this bad of a release/game. Its a damn crime. 1. Im sure everyone had this problem of the annoying extra hour or so of downloads at midnight. Its cool, I work at 5am. No biggie. I took a long nap and prepared. 2. The graphics were suprisingly.... AWFUL. And Im not even the only one. I thought I was at first. I mean my PC is.. OK. Theres so many items and objects with little texturing in the campaign. And there was this terrible lag every 15 seconds. 3. Basically... Activision is terrible dude. First they take 60 bucks for initial game. For 9-10 multiplayer maps. Just to turn around and sell you more maps in DLC. And not only that. Is War really the only game mode you could come up with??? Now. Some of these comments are coming from beta. Because I didnt even get to play multiplayer because the servers were down all night. Good thing I didnt pass over 2 hours of playing and got all my money back. I just feel bad for everyone playing console :/ Anyway...  DONT BUY / REFUND IMMEDIATELY and go pick up Day of Infamy instead if you want a CoD2-like game."

												The optimization is poor, despite the graphics being extremely bad. Another bad console port. The shooting feels clunking, the guns are extremely inaccurate and the audio is poor.

												The only thing i enjoyed in this game is single player. Even when it's not the best story and it's stupidly short.Multiplayer in this game is one of the worst things i've ever experienced in online games.Players are teleporting in front of my eyes (no, i'm not lagging), when they start running, they look like twice as good as Usain Bolt.Weapons have no recoil, you can just aimjump and hit all of your shots, it's really annoying when you're trying to shot someone with M1 Garand and they hit you first, you cant hit for♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's about who's gonna hit first and the one who hits first, is going to win the fight in 99% times, because when you're hit, your aim goes to heaven. This game is definitelly not worth of its full price. If you want to play actually good MP FPS game, play Battlefield 1. It's actually fun.I regret buying this."

												****Reinstalling..,i guess I'll give it another chance****Alright...I'll give a legit review; -The game itself is probably a 5.5/10-It generally just feels like a bad console port. -The weapons are imbalanced and questionably inaccurate.-The menu system is a cluttered mess that makes simple tasks seem more complicated then they should be.-The controls feel clunky. -The game changes its rules as it goes for example you can climb over certain boxes but certain boxes you can't climb over for no apparent reason, just because the game doesn't allow it.-In the  standards of a game that has been developed for approximately 3 years, it makes one ponder if it was even tested to make sure it was even remotely enjoyable to play other then just playable.-Divisions are pointless if you don't even follow what the actual division does in the army. For example Airborne jumps out of planes...it's what they do, that's basically their job and how they gained advantage on the enemy. Not thier primary MOS but, jesus...they take pride in that.-It crashes randomly for no apparent reason. Then recovers randomly in the backround like some kinda phantom entity. Do I have any Pro's? ...well...uh the sound effects are pretty good...minus the song that keeps looping at any cinematic part in the game. (Yes I mean the intro song) A knife loses its edge if you keep using it on everything. SO! I tried, oh how I tried so hard to like it. To this day I still believe the last good PC version of a Call of Duty game is MW1 when you can actually peak around corners. Everything feels like a mess...the voice acting was pretty disappointing for the campagne and generally the graphics don't feel smooth enough to be considered a PC game. I feel like they made this game just to give classic CoD fans the big middle finger, to once again prove they can still ♥♥♥♥ up a CoD game even though the blue prints were right in front of them this time. I've never in my life actually wanted a refund from a game considering I actually collect them. But this game has no place in a collection.For **** sakes I even have the game Merchants of Brooklyn, which then turned into Drug wars. That game is so bad but it was expected considering, well...look at the title, and the fact that i think it's either free now or probably $1.00. But even that game, with all the bugs, glitches, terrible audio, the fact that you can fall through the floor at any given moment, I mean even that game was entertaining because it kept me at the edge of my seat pondering when the next glitch was going to occur. Well...I tried, I really did, I'm sorry. I just...I can't, this is bad.:::UPDATE:::Yes, I reinstalled Drug Wars just to laugh at the glitches."

												Campaign was okay I would give it 8/10 in terms of story but 4/10 for historical accuracy. The guns dropped were historically inaccurate (PPSH's were apparently common?!). The build was pretty nostalgic when it came to health (reminded me of cod: finest hour). There were a lot of good scenes in the campaign but i wish they had done more for character development when it reached the ""climax"" because it felt like you were just getting to the good part and then BOOM epilogue. Also being a world of tanks player, the tank mission it didnt feel like you were in a tank because it was clearly optimized for console and i found it frustrating to even turn the turret. As for multiplayer and zombies its just like any other cod and pretty much a reskin. There are new modes though which I like so its not a complete reskin. Overall I won't recommend this game because of its price and there are more cons than pros and also due to the fact that they overhyped this game for what it is worth to me."

												Cash Grab.i had big expectations from ""back to the roots"" stuff and i hoped for the best.this is clearly made only to take money from naive customers.SP: 4/5+ cinematic experience+ nice story- too short - veteran difficulty is too easyZombies: 4/5+ not only ""survive until higher wave"", but you have objectives too which is a good plus (i played zombies only on WaW so i dont know what were in other cods)- only 1 map (they could give at least 1 more BUT thats reserved for Season Pass sh*t right?)MP: 2/5+- war mode is nice, but too short and too small.- maps are too small- only 6v6- only 9 maps- TTK (time to kill) is broken- most of  the weapons are useless so theres only a few guns that everyone use because they are kinda op- server issues. they had beta testing and they could see how many preorders did they sell so they could prepare for hype, but nope... really amateur-ishlast cod which i played was BO1, didnt even wanted to look at that futuristic crap sh*t, and before bo i played every single cod up to that date and clearly this doesnt have anything similar to old ones except WW2 theme.im glad that i didnt buy it on steam for 60e, but still 50e went to garbage.edit: it says that i have only 3h on record while i have 20..."

												It seems that CoD WWII has a good multiplayer right? Okay performance, boots on the ground and FOV slider?Well it isn´t terrible, but feels insanely dated and clunky at times. In the following I´ll list everything I´ve come across so far and what I think is wrong with it:1. Performance:Well lets say it´s okay. I play on a 980ti, everything low and frames average from 90-160. So still dips below 120, even on settings that look beyond terrible. But what´s much worse is that there seems to be micro stuttering occuring, mostly the first minutes after you started the game. After longer playing sessions (without Alt Tab) it seems to be gone.Another issue is that the mouse and/or keyboard seem to loose input sometimes. This also occurs the few minutes after starting the game and seems to fix itself (without Alt Tab) after some time.FOV slider is there, but when zooming in it gets incredibly narrow and ""weird"", so i stuck to 80 instead of the usual 90.Settings are good and plenty, only a seperate volume slider for the caster, soldier sounds would be helpfull, since that guy just won´t shut up.2. Gunplay and Movement:It shows more and more that the guns are designed to have auto aim. While I see people wrecking with the PPSH on console, it is really hard to kill people further away on PC. Generally the guns feels really inconsistent, I seem to drop real fast but the enemy sometimes takes 5-6 hits and still kills me.Also I´ve noticed when facing an enemy and he kills me instantaneously, I seem to have had no time to get a single shot off while in his kill cam, he had way more time to spot and kill me. It´s the big old ""on my screen he was not even visible / on my screen I was far behind cover"" story.To summarize, Gunplay and Movement feel very dated, like Infinity Warfare but just on the ground and with old weapon ""skins"".It is a very clunky, blocky feeling in comparison to previous modern warfare titles (MW2, MW3) which in my opinion, felt really smooth and rewarding.To quickly comment on the movement, it feels really bad. Not the own movement, but the movement of the enemies. First of all, it is subjectively really quick and unpredictable. Sometimes I have no problem killing an enemie with pin point accuracy, while sometimes I jiggle around the enemy or the enemy is ""untouched"" by my gunshots and straight turns on me. You can say that I´m just bad and thats fine, but just note that I´ve been playing CoD / Bf and other shooters for quiete a while, averageing 2.5 - 5 KD ratios.3. Maps:Well, I really don´t like any of them. I have some which are terrible and some who are okay. A lot of the suffer from open empty space and no real flanking routes. Some are way to big, which results in you just getting sniped from far away. Generally they look just like paintball fields and not real areas. They also have washed out colors, even with color correction, but that might just be because of the lowest settings im playing on. It seems to me that there are only 4 maps in the game, and no map is particually memorable. When BO2 was released, basically every map was really great to play and offered different playing styles. There were really small, medium and large maps. In WWII there are only medium and large maps.4. Content (guns, perks, ...):Well after even 3 hours it seems that you have already seen everything the game has to offer. All the SMG´s feel really similar and are really garbage on PC. Assault rifles are okay, they play a bit differently and are definetly superior on PC (BAR, FG 42). Since they´ve takend away everything from the pick 10 system, customisation is on an all time low. Just select one perk, a class and your weapon with obvious attachments. That´s it. If you want dead silence and a suppressor, well you can´t. What´s really annoying is sniping, it seems to be the single most annoying thing now. Not shotguns with fire rounds, no bayonet commando launch, SNIPING.On every big map, the outher routes are just death traps because in domination, there are most of the time 3 or more snipers camping in the base and watching every angle.5. Killstreaks:This gets an extra point, because it is more than laughable. You can argue that killstreaks ruin the game, that´s fine. But you either put them in or let them out. And if you put them in DO IT RIGHT!There is no discussion that the CoD ´s with the most powerfull killstreaks were the most successfull ones (BO2, MW2), just remember the Swarm, Loadstar and Dogs from BO2.What we have here is basically a joke. There is no point in taking any of the killstreaks beyong the glide bomb or the ""EMP"". I only play domination, which means for the paratroopers I need 25 pure kills, because for some reason Activision decided to release the game without ANY of the changes that have been made in the BETA.All of the killstreaks are boring and especially the top tier ones sometimes don´t even get a single kill. Paratroopers and the ""Warthog"" are a joke. The top killstreak ""gunship"" is okay, but for such a high streak just a joke as well (lasts 15 seconds).So you might think, well if they are straving away from killstreaks, what about specialist? Specialist was one of the best ""inventions"" in CoD that only found place in ""Cheating Warfare 3"" and the terrible ""Ghosts"" and then never again. So it´s UAV and counter UAV all the way.6. Summary:The whole game feels really dated and shallow. There is nothing exciting going on a big killstreak, unlocking guns, since all of the feel similar and boring. The medals are all the same again, presitge and all this Bs is back as usual and that´s it.It is really astounding that you could take CoD 4 and it would still play much nicer than this piece of software.CoD was always about ""unfair"" and weird querks like one man army, the nuke, AC 130, going on huge killstreaks and that was okay.Nothing of that is in WWII.As a final note I need to add and also ask, how you´re doing in the game. It seems that everybody is going like 25-15 (1.5 KD). It seems impossible to achieve a really high score, because of the time and score limits, and also because the general feel of the game.Sometimes you just die and you can´t even figure out what made you die so quickly. Killing more than 2 enemies is just impossible. If you miss a single bullet you get killed instantly.I´m just wondering what has happened, since the console guys are just running around slaughtering everybody and not getting hit even once. I had good games no question, but the reward is zero.Also the nade cooking is just the worst thing ever. You can´t play domination any more since everybody is chucking their nade onto B and sometimes you run and just die because of a random nade.Oh yeah and ground war is gone also (don´t know if it was in the previous ones)After I skipped CoD for over 3 years, it is now clear that for us old fans it is completely dead. No excitement, nothing new, nothing satisfieing about doing well.What will happen the next 3 months is that you will be able to buy supply drops with real money, they will add new weapons and variants in the game and much more. Probably also killstreaks and perks that have been scrapped before.Have fun playing!"

												The menu interfaces are a nightmare; you actually have to close the game and reboot it if you want to switch from storyline mode, zombies, or or multiplayer. The Storymode is really short and very boring compared to the older games; it felt like you were playing more of an interactive cinematic than a game; expect to beat the game in roughly 5 hours. Multiplayer is a disaster. Historically cod games came with 12 maps and you can buy a season pass to unlock future maps; Activision got greedy and released 12 maps in beta but only released 9 for the actual release to presumably sell the 3 later in future content. There are also many guns that should have recoil but don't and hitboxes of characters onlnie seem off. I hated how the devs caved in to the SJW bullying but bought the game anyway because I was a die hard fan; that and the devs said the storyline would be historically accurate; THEY LIED. I could write an entire review on all the unrealistic or histroric innacuracies but I an sure there are other negative reviews that have gone in great detail in this regards."

Summary:The whole game feels really dated and shallow. There is nothing exciting going on a big killstreak, unlocking guns, since all of the feel similar and boring. The medals are all the same again, presitge and all this Bs is back as usual and that´s it.It is really astounding that you could take CoD 4 and it would still play much nicer than this piece of software.CoD was always about ""unfair"" and weird querks like one man army, the nuke, AC 130, going on huge killstreaks and that was okay.Nothing of that is in WWII.As a final note I need to add and also ask, how you´re doing in the game. It seems that everybody is going like 25-15 (1.5 KD). It seems impossible to achieve a really high score, because of the time and score limits, and also because the general feel of the game.Sometimes you just die and you can´t even figure out what made you die so quickly. Killing more than 2 enemies is just impossible. If you miss a single bullet you get killed instantly.I´m just wondering what has happened, since the console guys are just running around slaughtering everybody and not getting hit even once. I had good games no question, but the reward is zero.Also the nade cooking is just the worst thing ever. You can´t play domination any more since everybody is chucking their nade onto B and sometimes you run and just die because of a random nade.Oh yeah and ground war is gone also (don´t know if it was in the previous ones)After I skipped CoD for over 3 years, it is now clear that for us old fans it is completely dead. No excitement, nothing new, nothing satisfieing about doing well.What will happen the next 3 months is that you will be able to buy supply drops with real money, they will add new weapons and variants in the game and much more. Probably also killstreaks and perks that have been scrapped before.Have fun playing!"

												Pros:- Campaign is really good so far (haven't finished it, only have heard positives about the story)- You can EARN dlc weapons unlike BO3, supply drops are completely optional- Guns are decently well balanced, some guns can be tweaked but overall well balanced- Movement is okay, sometimes a player can fly out of a corner (air strafing), they reintroduced dophin diving (I'm ok with it)- Scorestreaks don't count towards v2 (nuke) and require more points to earn eg. 5 kills for UAV- DLC guns aren't busted or a must have, some are actually underpowered eg. Gewher 43- Lots of different modes to play - There's lots to do in the social section, 1v1 friends, hangout, test guns, watch each others open supply drops- Boots on the ground- Variants only give EXP bonus, and absolutely no stat bonuses- War mode super fun and KD doesn't count only playing objective is- Sniping feels good and not too clunkyCons:- Extremely high volume of cheaters, I'm talking every 1-2 games there's a blatant cheater- Map design is totally ♥♥♥♥ing garbage, they really need a rework badly eg. Gustav and USS Texas (Nobody gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥if maps are realistic or not)- Lots and lots of players who camp, most of the time the opposing side wont push past the half way mark in linear or symmetric maps (This is due to poor map design which distrupt the flow of the game as a whole)- Spawns are also an issue, you can get spawn camped very easily (When you respawn sometimes you respawn in the exact spot you died over and over again)- Expeditionary division lol TLDR: Game as a whole really good fun, multiplayer is a mess it's filled with cheaters which makes it hard to get a good game in and Sledgehammer shouldn't hire a 2 year old to design maps and I got this game for free so I'm not fussed"

												We've played this game already, it was called Call of Duty 2.  They're just repackaging and reselling you the same game once a year.  They should just have a Call of Duty subscription service and charge fans 60$ a year for the same game with different set pieces. That being said, In the opening sequence, when you're dragging your squad mate through the battlefield and defending him trying to get him to safety, that was pretty intense.  I really liked that sequence. That was the best part of the game hands down.  Gameplay is overall mediocre and the same thing we have all seen before.  I would not recommend this game to anyone that has already played a Call of Duty game...Until it is 10$ even then, it's a rehash.Multiplayer is also the same with new set piece maps and similar perks etc.  It's time to move away from these overdone mainstay series and start trying something new."

												PSA- I HAVE NOT BEEN A FAN OF THE FRANCHISE SINCE BLACK OPS 2Everyone dealing out negative reviews needs to take a chill pill. This game is a serious step up from the later COD titles and I'm impressed. Is this the prefect game? NO, but it is a good one. If you buy this game with the the sole intention of nit picking every little thing the devs do wrong just to continue bad-mouthing COD you're stupid. This game delivers on the COD experience that it has long been deprived of. It's relatively straight forward. This game is EXACTLY what it looks like. Go watch gameplay. Solid graphics, good gunplay, decent multiplayer maps, entertaining campaign (though not the best). I'm giving this game a positive review and I haven't even played the zombie mode yet. The only debatable thing is the $60 pricetag. COD has and always will be a $60 title. If you're a fan of old boots on the ground Call of Duty then buy this game. If you're unsure, instead of reading the negative STEAM reviews head over to youtube and watch some videos of raw gameplay. And please, if you're buying this game to learn the history of WW2, go to school. This game is fictional, who cares if they change some small things.EDIT : The portion of the the campaign where you have a short tank fight is probably the worst thing in the entire game. Moving the tank and aiming the cannon on top is ridiculously hard and not fun at all."

												This game is the very definition of a ""mixed bag.""  I recommend it, but only 51%The multiplayer was a little more enjoyable to my surprise.  I read many reviews praising the single player but saying multiplayer was just another ordinary Call of Duty online game.  This is not the case, as Sledgehammer has managed to completely destroy the TDM-only reputation of the previous games.  They made one of their best modes, War, the most experience-rewarding gamemode, so expect that to be one of the most populated playists.  Because of the HQ orders and contracts, which give very desirable rewards (such as better weapons, xp boosts, free supply drops, etc...) for simply scoring a certain way in the various modes, I expect the non-TDM modes to never die.  All in all, I am glad for a guarantee of variety in Call of Duty multiplayer, it's just a shame there's so few maps right now.The campaign is ultra-linear, it makes CoD: WaW feel like an open world sandbox.  This wouldn't be a big problem if there didn't feel like a shooting gallery, because that's what pretty much every big gunfight felt like, just pop each enemy from the safety of cover then advance, no flanking required unless the game leads you that way.  The graphcis are amazing at some times that it looked like a movie, so it's worth playing through once or twice if you want an over-the top intense and cinematic WW2 experience.The zombies was scary at first, but after the jumpscare sound effects lost their effect on me, it was the most boring part of the game.  I don't want to play zombies anymore, Treyarch is the only developer that has and ever will do it right.I recommend buying the Digital Deluxe version when it's on sale.  It is still very expensive, but that's the only cost-effective way to get the much needed map boost in the near future."

												 Multiplayer, despite being boots on the ground, is still pretty bad, and has an excessive amount of hackers.

But I would avoid this game at all costs. Maybe if Treyarch makes a boots on the ground game it will be better than this garbage."

												TLDR:Campaign- fun but shortMultiplayer- fun if you get past stg and bar spam and if you play more than TDM/DOMZombies- dumbed down from treyarch but still very entertainingThe single player for this game is very short and can sometimes be very hard to control but it is a very fun campaign, keep in mind that you don't go through the same types of missions as earlier cod games set in World War 2 in this game you only fight on the western front instead of goin around through all parts of the war like in World at War.The multiplayer is extremely fun with having sunk over 90 hours into it and being at this moment 3rd prestige this game still seems to be thriving with peek player counts at around 15,000 players most days and the low end at around 7,000 players, so it it very easy to find a match in gamemodes that are not as popular. The game would be very boring if it didn't have war because there are only 9 multiplayer maps for all gamemodes except war and special made maps for war, if you are planning on just playing TDM or Domination you may not have as good of an experience. There are some really fun guns to use in this game like the m1a1 carbine and the thompson or the kar98k, but the game is dominated by people using the stg and the BAR but the game does have a very wide variety of guns to use that are pretty much made for every playstyle.The zombies is dumbed down from treyarch zombies but is still extremely fun to play especially if you have a group of friends to play with. Along with that there are two easter eggs in the first map where one is a guided sort of mission like easter egg while the other one is a complete easter egg with no help at all. once you beat the guided easter egg you do get another map to play but it is just the prologue map."

Steam, and I am not faulting them for this, pretty much tells you to go to Call of Duty support. Problem is, Activision has one page telling you that if your system is working, there is no other solution other than to contact Steam support. So, yeah... no.

												TLDR:Campaign- fun but shortMultiplayer- fun if you get past stg and bar spam and if you play more than TDM/DOMZombies- dumbed down from treyarch but still very entertainingThe single player for this game is very short and can sometimes be very hard to control but it is a very fun campaign, keep in mind that you don't go through the same types of missions as earlier cod games set in World War 2 in this game you only fight on the western front instead of goin around through all parts of the war like in World at War.The multiplayer is extremely fun with having sunk over 90 hours into it and being at this moment 3rd prestige this game still seems to be thriving with peek player counts at around 15,000 players most days and the low end at around 7,000 players, so it it very easy to find a match in gamemodes that are not as popular. The game would be very boring if it didn't have war because there are only 9 multiplayer maps for all gamemodes except war and special made maps for war, if you are planning on just playing TDM or Domination you may not have as good of an experience. There are some really fun guns to use in this game like the m1a1 carbine and the thompson or the kar98k, but the game is dominated by people using the stg and the BAR but the game does have a very wide variety of guns to use that are pretty much made for every playstyle.The zombies is dumbed down from treyarch zombies but is still extremely fun to play especially if you have a group of friends to play with. Along with that there are two easter eggs in the first map where one is a guided sort of mission like easter egg while the other one is a complete easter egg with no help at all. once you beat the guided easter egg you do get another map to play but it is just the prologue map."

												One of the best looking and best playing but alas buggiest entries in the COD franchise I've yet played. Lots of crashes - sometimes textures go missing - frame freezes - and I can't play the mission DEATH FACTORY (which is halfway through the entire game) or anything past that as the game crashes during the beginning of the cutscene and the error message ""DISC READ ERROR HURTGEN"" pops up. I've tried all the suggested fixes from verifying cache integrity to uninstalling it and re-downloading it (which can take DAYS because it's so huge) and re-installing it only to have the same exact error message pop up in the same exact place. Paying $60 to play half a great game still seems a huge rip off to me."

												I. Love. This. Game.Holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is amazing. I don't even know where to start, it's just so good.Campaign:The campaign is absolutely amazing, it's so good. The first cutscene introduces you to the characters and actually gives them backstories and you actually connect with them. Plus, you don't just play as the same guy the whole time, there are missions where you play as a French Spy, a tank driver, and a plane pilot. Plus the campaign works completely different than the multiplayer; no crosshairs, medkits instead of regen, always have both smokes and frags, no customizable loadouts, and a steady aim which slows down time to help hit shots. It's such a good campaign, it uses familiar missions, but is unique enough to be different.Multiplayer:Well, multiplayer is pretty good, just like any other CoD really. The create-a-class is no longer that 10-point system from BO2, BO3, and IW, and is now more like Modern Warfare. The Headquarters is awesome, it's nice to have a little social space as well as contracts and orders to get stuff. The game modes are pretty standard, but then there's War. War is amazing, it plays on huge maps that restrict play areas as the objective is completed, you get tons of XP and is a great place to get challenges done. They also remade Carentain from CoD1, CoD2, Chinatown from MW/MWR. The Supply Drops are cosmetic only thankfully, the varients you get are beautiful because Raven just does an amazing job with this stuff overall.Zombies:This is probably the best zombies mode in the entire series. Yes, even better than Treyarch. It's actually fair, there's no stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from Treyarch zombies. You have a health bar. They don't copy every perk from Treyarch zombies. Plus they have special abilities like being hidden from zombies, infinite ammo, a shockwave that knocks down zombies, and being chased by all zombies. There also ""mods"" which are modifications to your loadout, like being able to have 3 weapons, no explosive damage, firing guns while sprinting, increased ammo, etc. Plus you can change your starting weapon, it doesn't just have to be the 1911 every time. It's also much easier to do the easter egg than Treyarch zombies, it actually gives you the steps to do it, but that's just the casual EE, there's a harder, hidden EE to get the true ending to the map.Overall, this game had a rough start, but it's getting better over time, the DLC will make the game better, and I can't wait for more Zombies maps. This game gets a 9/10!"

												- Not historically accurate but it is CoD so who cares, you play it for fun not for historical accuracy.- Not the best optimization but Campaign and Zombies generally never stutter. Multiplayer can sometimes.- Balance is generally good in the game, you can use almost any weapon in the game and still get kills if you're skilled enough with it. This means you get a lot less repetitive gameplay if you use a weapon that gives you a challenge.- No customization for the German Army in Multiplayer which sucks.- Whilst I've barely played 2 hours of the campaign, from what I've played it has been fun.- For some reason the game is split between Call of Duty: WW2 for campaign and then Call of Duty: WW2 - Multiplayer for Multiplayer/Zombies. It is unknown why but anyway.Overall it is a really good game and I recommend to anyone looking for a casual shooter.Edit: Since I have mostly played Multiplayer my hours don't show as it only shows campaign hours."

(For the record, I have over 100 hours in multiplayer. Less than 10 in campaign)All in all, its a good game. Most of the time.The campaign is beautiful and quite fun. Definitly worth a playthrough.I don't play zombies so can't speak for that.The multiplayer is a little broken, but still mostly playable. I would keep an eye out for when they really get it together, but for now its a lot of bad connections, empty HQs, and quite a few hackers. The multiplayer systems are definitly something to get used to, but works. Just needs some balancing here and there.The HQ is great, again, when it works.I personally do enjoy this game, it just needs quite a bit of work yet."

												This review focuses on multiplayer.  Your typical COD game with a WW2 skin.  Overall, fun. I would prefer this to exo suits.  Gameplay is more grounded and there aren't enemies in front, to the side, behind, and above you all at once.  Map design still suffers in my opinion.  I think the weak map design is the biggest flaw in COD nowadays.  Most maps in the game are small, circular environments that encourage close quarters combat and force firefights.  I prefer the larger maps in the series such as the quarry map from mw2 and array from black ops 1, but I think I'm in the minority there.  These larger maps made me feel like I had more of a chance especially in modes like search and destroy. I also thought the gameplay was more tactical with that map design.  As a side note, the time limit for S&D was reduced and I'm not a fan of that.  Overall, if you like COD and twitch shooters you will probably enjoy this.  I hope map design improves in dlc/future installments of the series.  No map is memorable to me and gameplay doesn't seem as tactical to me as it used to be.Simply, recommended if you still find some enjoyment playing past COD titles and not recommended if not."

												After playing the demo the game looked graphicaly fantastic but the cheats managed to even hack the demo so I was in two minds about buying it as it was obviouse the cheats would still be about in the final game.And it is true there are still a huge amout of cheats but when you get a good clean game the hassel of dropping out of rounds seems worth it. In that respect though, if playing in a group then the hassel for a group to drop and re-invite only to do it again because of another cheat then that kills it.As for in-game the dinamics are perfect and a huge amount of atmosphire only missing out on location damage.  The number of game sytles and activities in game is just enormass with even more content available, just a shame the sheer amount of extra content make you feel you have purchased a demo and no the full game."

												Wow actually i gave it a thumbs up, but now i gotta edit this review, so likeSo i actually was hyped for this game , Not since MW3 i was excided for a COD game! but my smile turned upside down intill i realised what i got for 60 dollars.The Single player seems kinda boring , i played the first 2 missions and its just like i don't know yet. When landing on Normandy beach i expected something like from a movie Saving Private Ryan but , like hell no! the who thing lasts 2 min and u ran across 3 trenches and you get into the bunkers lol. And Nazis use PPSHs instead of MP 40s , i found only 1 in that missons lmao. God historicly accurate right? i don't care about that black women nazis stuff in multiplayer but this is just bland. There is this Railshooter part in the first missions the whole thing looks like Rambo the video game lmao, jesus that was just cringe part.The MP is just oh god, 1 word boring as hell.I don't know why but the Beta seemed for fun and fast paced, Everygame i play i get like the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3 maps, that are too large and its only 6v6 , in TDM and Domination. I spend half the match runnig around trying people to kill, kill one guy run all the way to the other side of the map get another kill, camping would bore the hell out of you, and its just the same thing running around trying to find people then boom youre killed, running around some more boom killed again. Its just like something is missing in the game. game seems unfinished . AND 9 MP maps really? like cmon its getting boring so fast, they only added a few more guns since the beta and few more stuff , thats all i expected much more out of multiplayer, the WAR gamemode seems cool but also bland. The HQ mode is kinda cool , probably the coolest thing in multiplayer, but god THE PISTOL grip cases are amazing!! god thats bad. The Community will die out fast im sure on PC specially.I gave it a 8/10 before, but now it goes down to 4/10, just unfinished."

												I came into this expecting nothing great, but I was pleasantly surprised. The Campaign was both fun and well written and for the first time I can remember in Call of Duty, great acting.Standard Multiplayer is a bore, offering nothing new and is a waste of time unless you are going for supply drops through orders.War however is fun and offers a lot and I always find myself coming back to it. Its a mode that I find fits perfectly in this game.Zombies is the best it has been since BO2. I love how the zombies health doesnt increase all that much and that the difficulty comes solely from sheer numbers.Overall I find that this game is a good step in the right direction. They just need to find away to re-imagine the multiplayer without changing Call of Duty's signature style with something that doesn't belong."

												Heres my review of CoD:WWII (possible spoilarz)SINGLEPLAYER;Things i liked; The games story is amazing, it feels like an oldschool Medal of honor game mixed with the movies ""Fury"" and ""Inglourious Basterds""The graphics are really nice looking and at times i was thinking that it was decently close to looking as good as Battlefield 1(ill add more as i think of stuff)Things i disliked:The Bullet Sponge enemies: it takes 4-5 shots with some guns to down an enemy and even with a direct hit to the face sometimes wont kill.. fair enough if you hit armor or something but jeezThe horrid vehicle controls: driving in this game is trash, the cars are near impossible to control and the tank mission is worse.. The way stealth works: stealth in CoD:WWII is pretty amazing it really shows off the great technology that the Wehrmacht was using that allowed them to see through walls and call allies while being stabbed in the throat.MULTIPLAYER;its really fun! ive played about 10 hours so far and i love the way they have done the new daily/weekly challenges and the headquaters player area is a pretty sweet addition for a CoD game.However like all previous CoD games on PC it will suffer the great player migration about 5 weeks after launch and drop from 20k players to 2k...My only issue so far with the multiplayer is that everytime i launch it it resets my Audio settings + my FOV setting. its no real big issue and will possibly be patched.(also ive only seen 2-3 hackers in my time of playing if anyone wants to know)ZOMBIES;havent played it because im a little ♥♥♥♥♥Overall i give this game a 7/10 wait until a decent sale to buy. i really enjoyed the story and ill probs end up replaying it at some point however i cant give it a higher review with the issues it has + the massive $80AUD price tag..still has no ape escape 2 remaster btw"

Unlike the ""Call of Dutys'"" of old where tactics where envolved, such as ""camping"" and stratigic play.

												I only play online and after the latest update I can't even start the game. I have a ryzen 1700x and a gtx 1070 so hardware is not the issue here. Also 90% of the maps in this game are absolute trash and make the game much less fun to play. Not a bad game overall but they could have done so much better. Also stop messing with the stats of the guns this kind of thing should of been figured out forever ago and it's really annoying."

multiplayer only reviewtl;dr: If you disliked the recent CoDs, don't bother with WWIIFirst of all, I like Call of Duty. I just want it to be better, to try harder. That's why I am writing this review. Secondly, I mostly play Domination. So some critique might not apply in other game modes.Pros:- 60Hz-ish ""netcode"" with mostly dedicated servers- no jetpacks; although I think this is more an issue of map design than the fact itselfCons:- Map Design / Spawn CampingSpawn Camping never felt this problematic like in WWII. Sure, in former CoDs one would occasionally have bad Team Balance and could get trapped in one's spawning location. But here it seems whichever team wins the first gun fight stands directly in front of the other team's spawn. The map design seems to support that issue. Not only are most maps quite small, but also do they have many many flanking routes. So one can never be sure from where the enemy is coming from. Becaus of that, to establish map control is quite difficult. As a result many matches feel kind of like a ""merry-go-round"": One captures one point only to lose another. Rinse and repeat. Inspite of the lack of jetpacks this often feels like the most recent CoDs. Which, in itself, we had hoped would be left behind by returning to ""boots on the ground"", right?""Gustav Cannon"" seems to be an exclusive sniper map. You don't like sniping? Well, good luck trying to traverse the map without being one-shoted. That said, If one likes to snipe it can be quite fun.""Gibraltar"": This has to be the most unbalanced map in CoD history.  Small and with so many nooks and crannies around the B-flag that it is almost impossible to capture it back without killing the whole opfor beforehand. And even then due to its size there is seldom room to breathe.Also there are only nine maps (plus three for war mode).- Time-to-Kill (TTK)incredably low; That might be a direct result of the 60Hz update rate. If previous CoDs had had WWII's ""Netcode"", TTK might have felt equally low. I wouldn't mind a higher TTK / lower bullet damage in order for more consistent, skillful gunfights. Might feel increased because of the map design.FlinchOMG the flinching. One dies quite often to one's gun kicking upwards unexpectedly. With the low TTK, one can not afford to flinch. Simultaneously, when hit the screen flashes white and red wildly. This is rather distracting and annoying. There is a ""Basic Training"" to mitigate this effect somewhat. But it almost becomes a must-pick with slower firing guns. Grenade SpamNever have I been killed because of so many random grenades. This is mostly an issue of map design and mapsize, again.Grenades should maybe be less powerful. Then again, with better maps this might not be a problem.  Shell ShockWhen one gets hit by a grenade, even by a friendly one, one gets ""shell schocked"". Its basically a stun effect with additional blurred vision. This is so annoying an absolutely unnecessary and just adds to the compressed skill gap. SMG HavenWhile SMGs alwayz were strong in CoD, this time due to major disadvantages of most assault rifles (low ammo count, low fire rate, hindered vision because of muzzle flash, slower handling speed ...) one often defaults back to the SMG-class. Well, yeah, sniping is strong too. In fact if you don't want to deal with all this SMG BS just take a sniper rifle. At least then it's over after one shot. I'd argue that sniping is more viable in WWII than ARs are. The dominance of the PPSH (SMGs) is of course due to the map design which heavily favors mobility, flanking and hip-firing. Can't leave game at certain eventsAt halftime and directly after the game when the ""play of the game"" is displayed one is not allowed to leave. And afterwards I have to watch those, life- and emotionless emotes executed by the ""winners circle"" and wait for the loot boxes to be distributed *sigh*.No PC-Specific balancingIMO the PC-plattform needs a completely different approch to balancing than the consoles do. But that would require a dedicated PC-Dev team instead of a ""simple"" (meaning: not doing more than that) console port, wouldn't it?Loot Boxes / Micro TransactionsCoD is still the best selling franchise there is. And it nevertheless implements these manipulative means in order to snatch more money out of our pockets. While it is possible to buy stuff with ingame credits it is a hell of a grind. I wonder why that is ...So, there you have it. Now go and play a game that is woth your time."

												I really enjoyed this game for about a month after waiting for server fixes and general bugs to allow me to play lag free. Then the hackers came in and made playing the game unplayable on modes like domination and killcomfirmed where they are constantly in. I went to free for all and it became somewhat playable. Then they release different patches that make my game stutter to hell and i have to lower everything in my settings, when I shouldn't because my computer build is more than enough to run the game on Extra settings. The resitance patch was released and I couldn't even open the game without task manager open. I had to lower my settings even futher, because of stuttering, to make it playable. The hackers have just gotten worse in the last week and its the same people that are doing it, but still no ban. I didn't even mention the server connection time is awful to say the least. I really like this game for its multiplayer but when i have to deal with a chaotic playerbase what's even the point. I was underwhelmed by the nazi zombies and it seemed lack-luster to pervious games. Single player wasnt the reason i bought the game so i can't give a review on that. Overall, i just want some type of anti-cheat that helps remove some of the cheaters, fixes for optimization of different pc builds and something more nostalgic with nazi zombies. 76 hours of less than ok gameplay, but i was looking for something i could play like World at War or BO1. If you are looking for that don't buy this game."

												Do not purchase this game.  The update on 1/23/18 has crashed my game as well as almost all PC players from what Ive researched online.  I have seen that only when running Task Manager the game will load.  My game loads, displays a safety announcement about improper shutdown then crashes immediately.  Steam forwards all questions to Activision and Activision's customer support is non-existent.  I spoke with an ""Ambassador"" and eventually forwarded me the link back to activision's customer support.  The ""chat"" option with Activision has been ""offline"" for three days since the crash.  I am a lifelong COD player and surprised that the creators of this game are allowing this to happen.  Ive un-installed and re-installed and nothing is working.  Activision has not released any announcements about the crash or anything they are doing to restore players ability to play again.  It appears they simply do not care.  I will be staying away from anything produced by Activision."

												Call of Duty: WWII in my opinion is a really great game. The campaign is so good, but does only last 6 hours. Multiplayer is really fun, and zombies is actually scary at some points.

This game cost me 1600 CZK already, dont force me THAT HARD to buy cosmetic items via COD POINTS!Next what really grinds my fkn balls is the fact, that after long awaited update I was unable to play it, due to the error message ""It appears that COD was not quit properly last time"". After a quick research I found out, that all CoD games ported to PC had this error message in common (Can't yall make a properly running game, if its expensive AF?!).

												1. You can't level up in Zombies properly2. You always get paired with a small child or someone who cannot speak English3. The Easter Egg walkthrough is very dumb and does not describe things well4. There's an objective screen but no highlighting5. The Easter Egg steps for upgrading to the Ripper are extensive and buggy.6. They changed the Point system to ""Jolts,"" which is just another name for Points7. I cannot stress how annoying it is just to look at a zombie and some stupid sound plays because I looked at it.Seriously it's not scary, it just bugs you when every time you turn it's just some stupid sound playing.8. The Zombie spawns are fudged, they spawn way too quickly, way too sporadically, and there's too many spawn locations.9. Feels more like Killing Floor than Zombies sometimes. This isn't a new spin on it, this is making it a different game.10. Specifically having to feed types of zomhies to specific things gets very hard to do when those types of zombies don't spawn for up to whole rounds at a time.11. The House doesn't have specific Perk machines.12. The House has 3 weapons and no box.13. The House has no Upgrade Station.14. The House has no Self-Revive, even on solo.15. It seems like Zombies can just randomly spawn wherever they want. Even without a spawnpoint, they can just randomly appear behind you.Now for Campaign.1. It's too short.2. The characters are 2-Dimensional.3. The secondary arcs (Such as Pierson having a stereotypical arc which never gets resolved) are basic.4. There's too many characters to have to know. WaW had 3 characters you needed to know, this has about 8.5. The weapon choice makes no sense entirely, WaW had a seemingly larger weapon variety, more viable weapons, but this made me feel like I was using the same guns over and over.6. Ripped a page right out of Battlefield for some missions (The train, foggy forest fights, 1-dimensional vehicle chases)7. 1-Dimensional Vehicle chases8. No Russian campaign, or Russians at all, despite the PPSh being a prominent weapon in the campaign9. No mention of the Canadians, the Polish, the Russians, or any British aside from 2 characters for the entire campaign10. The new ""healing"" system is very unnecessary and will definitely be scrapped by next game.11. Random FPS drops during cutscenes, despite shader preload being on or off.12. Padded run-time in a bad way by trying to make it seem so ""cinematic."" If I wanted cinematic, I'd watch a movie. Seriously. I'm not playing this game while eating popcorn saying, ""I can't wait to see that next 10 minute cutscene!"" I understand you guys worked hard but this was just bad.13. The main character you play as is INCREDIBLY unlikable, as you gave him a voice and a face right off the bat but with no actual choices you could make to change these in the campaign. Even WaW had these 10 years ago. You may as well have just given me a movie at this point. Please don't. Don't give Roman any more ideas.14. You only connect with one character the entire campaign and even he has very little run time himself. You have one moment with him, and then one more at the end where it doesn't matter anymore.  The trailers even lied about just how this character's arc would turn out by showing you mostly cutscenes from the end of the game 15. The only part of the campaign that felt mildly good was  when you save the small German child and her sister gets shot and as for Multiplayer. Sweet, sweet multiplayer.1. You wanna talk about gimmicks? There's about 4 different types of challenges you can engage in at once. Get 130 kills in 40 minutes in any game mode. Yes, it's possible. No, you definitely won't get it unless you've already unlocked the best weapons in the MP game mode or are really lucky.2. The shotguns are weak and broken as hell. Please study just how shotguns work and properly adjust range and damage to fit. Even shotguns from WW2 didn't feel this much like nerf guns. ""But muh balancing!"" no. Just, no. They're already unbalanced.3. The weapons in some classes feel too far-apart in unlocking, especially when you're trying to focus on one division specifically, it gets annoying using the same gun for 20 levels just to unlock a better gun, which you have to use again for 20 levels, which you unlock a better gun and then have to prestige your division to get.4. Where are the big maps with drivable tanks in Team Deathmatch?5. We asked for WW2 and you still managed to fudge it by giving us reticles with customizable laser sights. What? Why not just normal LENS sights or Apertures???Over all, it felt like this CoD was just using WW2 as an excuse to put us back into boots on the ground and knew it would sell well under the WW2 hype gimmick. This game actually feels like trash, and makes Black Ops 3 seem like the new Modern Warfare in a ""Best Call of Duty game"" sense."

												I never review games, but I had to for this one. Single-player was non-spectacular and honeslty predictable. I'm not looking for realism, but when you sell it for historical accuracy and as a tribute for WWII vets, you could've TRIED to make some of the storyline believable. Some guy is haunted by his men dying, so he tries to get them killed? Crappy mechanics and controls (especially for the portions you're controlling a vehicle), hackneyed sneak missions, and dumb AI.. BUT what really prompted me to give this review were the bugs for multiplayer. I was unable to login to multiplayer at all for a week because it constantly had ""connection issues."" Until I searched for the issue online and found out a CRAP load of people had the same error. Then after finally being able to play, the amount of bs ""skill-shot"" players out there, made it almost impossible to play a decent game. But that was still tolerable, until a new bug came out and now I'm getting disc_read errors... I got this from Steam.. what disc? Why are there so many errors for a game/franchise that was really built on multiplayer..? Its just not interesting or worth the purchase unless there's some kind of super discount... that and they fix the host of bugs and problems."

The trailers even lied about just how this character's arc would turn out by showing you mostly cutscenes from the end of the game 15. The only part of the campaign that felt mildly good was  when you save the small German child and her sister gets shot and as for Multiplayer. Sweet, sweet multiplayer.1. You wanna talk about gimmicks? There's about 4 different types of challenges you can engage in at once. Get 130 kills in 40 minutes in any game mode. Yes, it's possible. No, you definitely won't get it unless you've already unlocked the best weapons in the MP game mode or are really lucky.2. The shotguns are weak and broken as hell. Please study just how shotguns work and properly adjust range and damage to fit. Even shotguns from WW2 didn't feel this much like nerf guns. ""But muh balancing!"" no. Just, no. They're already unbalanced.3. The weapons in some classes feel too far-apart in unlocking, especially when you're trying to focus on one division specifically, it gets annoying using the same gun for 20 levels just to unlock a better gun, which you have to use again for 20 levels, which you unlock a better gun and then have to prestige your division to get.4. Where are the big maps with drivable tanks in Team Deathmatch?5. We asked for WW2 and you still managed to fudge it by giving us reticles with customizable laser sights. What? Why not just normal LENS sights or Apertures???Over all, it felt like this CoD was just using WW2 as an excuse to put us back into boots on the ground and knew it would sell well under the WW2 hype gimmick. This game actually feels like trash, and makes Black Ops 3 seem like the new Modern Warfare in a ""Best Call of Duty game"" sense."

												Overall not too bad of a game the only real problem I had was the tank and air plane conrtols that seem like they were designed by an autistic 4 year old but the game is definetley not worth 60$. As well as it seems there are 3 different games that you have to switch between (Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer) and it becomes annoying when you want to switch as you have to completely exit the game for it to switch to the other ""game"" as well as each has its own settings and if you have multiple monitors you better hope its starts on the correct one because if not the ""choose monitor"" button doesnt seem to work and the only way to correct it is to unplug your other monitors."

												Wow actually i gave it a thumbs up, but now i gotta edit this review, so likeSo i actually was hyped for this game , Not since MW3 i was excided for a COD game! but my smile turned upside down intill i realised what i got for 60 dollars.The Single player seems kinda boring , i played the first 2 missions and its just like i don't know yet. When landing on Normandy beach i expected something like from a movie Saving Private Ryan but , like hell no! the who thing lasts 2 min and u ran across 3 trenches and you get into the bunkers lol. And Nazis use PPSHs instead of MP 40s , i found only 1 in that missons lmao. God historicly accurate right? i don't care about that black women nazis stuff in multiplayer but this is just bland. There is this Railshooter part in the first missions the whole thing looks like Rambo the video game lmao, jesus that was just cringe part.The MP is just oh god, 1 word boring as hell.I don't know why but the Beta seemed for fun and fast paced, Everygame i play i get like the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3 maps, that are too large and its only 6v6 , in TDM and Domination. I spend half the match runnig around trying people to kill, kill one guy run all the way to the other side of the map get another kill, camping would bore the hell out of you, and its just the same thing running around trying to find people then boom youre killed, running around some more boom killed again. Its just like something is missing in the game. game seems unfinished . AND 9 MP maps really? like cmon its getting boring so fast, they only added a few more guns since the beta and few more stuff , thats all i expected much more out of multiplayer, the WAR gamemode seems cool but also bland. The HQ mode is kinda cool , probably the coolest thing in multiplayer, but god THE PISTOL grip cases are amazing!! god thats bad. The Community will die out fast im sure on PC specially.I gave it a 8/10 before, but now it goes down to 4/10, just unfinished."

												Heres my review of CoD:WWII (possible spoilarz)SINGLEPLAYER;Things i liked; The games story is amazing, it feels like an oldschool Medal of honor game mixed with the movies ""Fury"" and ""Inglourious Basterds""The graphics are really nice looking and at times i was thinking that it was decently close to looking as good as Battlefield 1(ill add more as i think of stuff)Things i disliked:The Bullet Sponge enemies: it takes 4-5 shots with some guns to down an enemy and even with a direct hit to the face sometimes wont kill.. fair enough if you hit armor or something but jeezThe horrid vehicle controls: driving in this game is trash, the cars are near impossible to control and the tank mission is worse.. The way stealth works: stealth in CoD:WWII is pretty amazing it really shows off the great technology that the Wehrmacht was using that allowed them to see through walls and call allies while being stabbed in the throat.MULTIPLAYER;its really fun! ive played about 10 hours so far and i love the way they have done the new daily/weekly challenges and the headquaters player area is a pretty sweet addition for a CoD game.However like all previous CoD games on PC it will suffer the great player migration about 5 weeks after launch and drop from 20k players to 2k...My only issue so far with the multiplayer is that everytime i launch it it resets my Audio settings + my FOV setting. its no real big issue and will possibly be patched.(also ive only seen 2-3 hackers in my time of playing if anyone wants to know)ZOMBIES;havent played it because im a little ♥♥♥♥♥Overall i give this game a 7/10 wait until a decent sale to buy. i really enjoyed the story and ill probs end up replaying it at some point however i cant give it a higher review with the issues it has + the massive $80AUD price tag..still has no ape escape 2 remaster btw"

Steam forwards all questions to Activision and Activision's customer support is non-existent.  I spoke with an ""Ambassador"" and eventually forwarded me the link back to activision's customer support.  The ""chat"" option with Activision has been ""offline"" for three days since the crash.  I am a lifelong COD player and surprised that the creators of this game are allowing this to happen.  Ive un-installed and re-installed and nothing is working.  Activision has not released any announcements about the crash or anything they are doing to restore players ability to play again.  It appears they simply do not care.  I will be staying away from anything produced by Activision."

												I really enjoyed this game for about a month after waiting for server fixes and general bugs to allow me to play lag free. Then the hackers came in and made playing the game unplayable on modes like domination and killcomfirmed where they are constantly in. I went to free for all and it became somewhat playable. Then they release different patches that make my game stutter to hell and i have to lower everything in my settings, when I shouldn't because my computer build is more than enough to run the game on Extra settings. The resitance patch was released and I couldn't even open the game without task manager open. I had to lower my settings even futher, because of stuttering, to make it playable. The hackers have just gotten worse in the last week and its the same people that are doing it, but still no ban. I didn't even mention the server connection time is awful to say the least. I really like this game for its multiplayer but when i have to deal with a chaotic playerbase what's even the point. I was underwhelmed by the nazi zombies and it seemed lack-luster to pervious games. Single player wasnt the reason i bought the game so i can't give a review on that. Overall, i just want some type of anti-cheat that helps remove some of the cheaters, fixes for optimization of different pc builds and something more nostalgic with nazi zombies. 76 hours of less than ok gameplay, but i was looking for something i could play like World at War or BO1. If you are looking for that don't buy this game."

TL:DRIf this was just a review of the game, it would be positive. However, it specifically asks whether or not I would recommend this game to others, and sadly at this time I would not. I do not think the average player would be willing to look past all these flaws and enjoy the overall game. There are performance issues, massive gameplay issues, connectivity issues, balancing issues, and crashes. Despite all this, I have played over 100 hours already between MP and zombies, and I will continue playing more of it. Why? Because even though all these problems are often frustrating and in the case of zombies can waste hours of your progress, the core game is fun enough to compensate for all of that.Single PlayerI have not played most of the single player, but I have seen large parts of it and it is pretty much what you would expect from a CoD campaign. There's lots of shooting, there are overly dramatic near-death scenes, and there are invincible allies who get to play the hero. The limited health system combined with the WW2 theme makes the game feel like a shooter from a century and a half ago for those seeking a nostalgia trip. It can be annoying and has its flaws, but nothing notable. This isn't really the reason most people would buy the game.ZombiesThe zombies mode here is a great concept with a good design but suffering from poor execution. As none of the DLC packs have come out yet, there isn't a large map pool to choose from; The Final Reich is the main attraction, and the prologue serves as a tutorial. A slightly different version of the end of the prologue exists as its own standalone map as well. The gameplay is similar enough to previous games for the fans while also being different enough to feel refreshing. There are multiple layers of complexity in terms of easter eggs and hidden challenges: casual players can just play the game, hardcore players can unlock all the characters, and others can try anything in between. There is lots of customization allowed, from weapon attachments and camos to your specialist ability and even three sub-abilities.However, all of this is overshadowed by the technical problems. The game occasionally crashes, with very frustrating repercussions; any special items used, like self-revives or discount tokens, will still be used up. Your experience and any challenges you accomplished during the match will be gone, though. Similarly, host migration is almost always as good as a crash. Most of the time it sends you directly back to the menu instead of the game, but one time it managed to actually work (sort of). However, the two remaining players both timed out and the game sort of bugged out, forcing me to leave the match regardless. On top of all that, there are many issues with the hidden character unlocks. Many people are not receiving them despite fulfilling all the requirements, and it seems there are many ways for them to bug out.MultiplayerIgnoring any problems that come up, the multiplayer gameplay is amazingly fun. It's addictive, rewarding, and carried out pretty well. Microtransactions in terms of the supply crates seem justified to me as all they provide are some cosmetic pieces. There are plenty of supply drops to be earned for free anyway every single day for fulfilling challenges and contracts, so there is no need to buy them unless you are really desperate for a weapon skin. Armory credits, earned from challenges/contracts and duplicates, can also be used to buy most individual items instead of hoping to get it from a supply drop. The accumulation rate is fair enough to allow most people to at least get an epic skin for their favorite weapon/class pretty early on. As usual in the series, there is lots of customization available with your character, player card, and weapons. There is some decent variety in the scorestreaks and trainings (perks) that allow many different play styles even with the same gear. Maps are distributed pretty well: there is one long-range map meant for sniping, a few smaller fast-paced maps, and the rest are moderately large.While it is trivial in zombies for the most part, lag compensation and connection problems become a very big issue in multiplayer. Constant rubberbanding will often get you killed and can easily be frustrating. People with fast internet still have lag issues and people with strong computers still have performance issues, Other than that, weapon balancing is fairly wonky. Even by Call of Duty standards, some of the shotguns are pathetically weak. Meanwhile, a few rifles and sniper rifles are an easy ticket to the top of a scoreboard. While the game gives up realism for gameplay, it also does not go as far as it should. Many of the weapons feel too similar and even seem functionally identical. For example, both the SVT-40 and Gewehr 43 have 10 shots in a clip and are semi-automatic rifles that kill in two shots. They have very small differences, but feel and even look pretty much the same. Arguably the biggest problem with this game though is the respawn mechanic. Even on larger maps, with 8 or less people in the match, the game will sometimes spawn you within ten feet of an enemy and you might be shot at before you are able to perform some basic actions (putting on a suppressor, activating a scorestreak, loading incendiary shells) after spawning. At other times, you will respawn in the middle of nowhere and spend as much as 25 seconds running around before you see another player.OverallThis game has the potential to be a 10/10 in my eyes. It does many things very well and is a refreshing way of getting back into the series since the last game I played before buying this was Ghosts. The problem is with the game performance, not the content. However, like I said up top, I can not recommend this to an average player since the game is likely to be a frustrating experience, assuming it actually runs. I will happily change my recommendation for the game once enough of these issues are fixed to allow a more pleasant experience"

												After racking up around 50 hours on this game, I have come to the conclusion that i wasted my £45. It is honestly just frustrating. The campaign is way too short to build up any attachment to the characters and the storytelling treats you like you're an idiot by pointing out literally anything that everyone who isn't braindead can pick up on. The online is mediocre, games like CS:GO are much more challenging and fun and even has a less salty community. I mean, the other day, someone was killed by some guy swatting another because of a competitive CoD game. I'll probably still play it from time to time but the novelty of the game returing to WW2 has worn off at this point. Save yourself some money and don't bother with this game."

												I really enjoyed this game for about a month after waiting for server fixes and general bugs to allow me to play lag free. Then the hackers came in and made playing the game unplayable on modes like domination and killcomfirmed where they are constantly in. I went to free for all and it became somewhat playable. Then they release different patches that make my game stutter to hell and i have to lower everything in my settings, when I shouldn't because my computer build is more than enough to run the game on Extra settings. The resitance patch was released and I couldn't even open the game without task manager open. I had to lower my settings even futher, because of stuttering, to make it playable. The hackers have just gotten worse in the last week and its the same people that are doing it, but still no ban. I didn't even mention the server connection time is awful to say the least. I really like this game for its multiplayer but when i have to deal with a chaotic playerbase what's even the point. I was underwhelmed by the nazi zombies and it seemed lack-luster to pervious games. Single player wasnt the reason i bought the game so i can't give a review on that. Overall, i just want some type of anti-cheat that helps remove some of the cheaters, fixes for optimization of different pc builds and something more nostalgic with nazi zombies. 76 hours of less than ok gameplay, but i was looking for something i could play like World at War or BO1. If you are looking for that don't buy this game."

												Campaign-I have yet to fully finish the campaign, but after completing several missions i have a good idea of how the campaign works. I am very upset to see swastika's inaccurately replaced with Iron Crosses and i am more upset to see smaller gameplay inaccuracies such as ppsh-41's and svt-40's in German hands on D-day- especially when they promised a highly realistic campaign experience, but worst of all i am upset at the writing of the campaign as none of the characters seem likable enough to become attached to. -On the plus side, the new gameplay mechanics such as returning to a health kit-based health system and the addition of squad support abilities have high potential for future installments of the game. Multiplayer-As of right now, i enjoy the multiplayer. The new Division system is very well done and has good potential for future installments, i love how easy it is to earn supply drops, and the cosmetic items arent ever too over the top.-on the downside, however, many pieces of csometic equipment for your character are inconsistent and inaccurate to the war. I won't comment on the inclusion of colored skin adn female character options in multiplayer as i see no problem with inclusion in a portion of the game that is meant to be non-canon and heavily customizable. Not only that but, aside from some server issues ad the ocassional but rare hacker, the game is still FUN and FUN in the end, is always the purpose of a Call of Duty game.-i am very hopeful for the future of this game's multiplayer, but i am also concerned as microtransactions have been added to the game before paintjobs and emblems have been added. As of right now, i assume this is a choice made so that microtransactions can be out of the way, giving them more time to work on the missing features, but i am worried that they may not finish these features until too late (similar to infinite warfare's lack of leaderboards for 3/4s of the games lifetime).-This game's variants are also very good as the only things they do is cosmetically change a gun and provide a small xp boost, and they can be obtained very easily and without a lot of hair-tearing-out.Zombies-holy balls this good. Seriously. It goes back to waw's established roots of psychotic Nazi scientists, over-the-top electrical gadgets, and spooky atmospheres combined with enhancements to the zombies gameplay formula that were made in Black Ops 3 and Infinite warfare such as limited use consumable items and specialist abilities. -Also, for everyone who says the lack of maps is bad, Black ops 1 had two zombies maps (not counting dead ops) and black ops 3 had 1 map but both were considered to be great zombies modes. Not only that, this game has 2 maps, its just the second map has to be earned.Final Scores:Campaign: 1/3Multiplayer: 2/3Zombies: 3/3Overall: 7/10, good game, has potential, needs some work.If you have friends to play this with and like playing games that arent historically accurate but still fun, i recommend this game for you (but maybe try to wait for a sale)"

												Singleplayer is short albeit enjoyable. Characters are actually given some time to flesh themselves out. Sledgehammer tries a number of new things to keep gameplay varied between the typical CoD shooting gallery sections. Multiplayer is one step foward, several steps backward from previous titles. Laggy connections, inconsistent netcode, poor weapon balance, confusing map layouts, and what seems to be a total lack of effective matchmaking system. Removing specialists was a good move foward after Black Ops 3 and the particularly dismal Infinite Warfare but they stripped the rest of what made the post-CoD: MW games so enjoyable, namely the customization.Hard to recommend at full price to anyone except a diehard Call of Duty fan who can look past the typical faults of a CoD title, but even then so many confused changes have occured in the multiplayer portion that it might not appeal even to them. For everyone else, wait for a sale. The singleplayer doesn't carry the full price of the game and the multiplayer is broken and unbalanced. Given the player counts I imagine that shouldn't be too long."

												I've completed the campaign of this game and I'd say, It's pretty good. It's not the MOST realistic campaign but it's pretty good. It's not amazing but it's pretty good. The zombies is so fun to play with your friends (like I have any) and even playing online with strangers is fun. Multiplayer is alright, it's not the best but it's alright. Over all this game is fine. Many people complain about the ""Futuristic Call of Duty"" from like last year and the year before and now they made it boots on the ground this year. People complain about the graphics but the graphics is fine to me. Yeah, multiplayer lags some times and the loading times are slow but once you get playing it's fun. In this game, it's basically futuristic cod but with no jetpacks and World War 2 Themed (Multiplayer) and for campaign it's World War 2. Not futuristic bull crap like last years cod.

Runs well, however some of the intro vidoes while loading look slightly less fluid (CPU and old I5 at ~4.4 struggles), but no hitching/stuttering/slowdowns during actual gameplay on very high graphics settings no matter the action.The story seems great so far however the missions are short.But the game is more frustrating then fun due to one awful mechanic.You need to move your mouse to a circle in about .5 second then press a hotkey to continue. If you don't than you immediately die and then have to watch the same stupid cutscene over and over again. Sounds easy just move your mouse!!. I keep getting stuck on this stupid mechanic and each time it appears in the game results in me closing it down as it takes several attempts every time :(I'm not 12 years old i don't have the reflexes to twitch into a spot instaneously.I haven't played COD since MW2, but played COD2 and 4 significantly. MW2 compaign was brilliant and gorgeous.This mechanic ruins the fun in the game for me and i'm not sure i will bother finishing the campaign.Other than that the mission where you have to fight the tanks is let down awfully by the most absurd stupid control system for a vehicle that I have ever witnessed in any game (movement/camera/control input).It's evident this game was not playtested by mainstream gamers. Aka not ""professional gamers"", paid staff, youtube heros or COD fanboys."

												Framerate stutters and dips into the single digits frequently. The issue may hide for 1 or 2 matches online, but will always make its appearance soon after and stay until restarting the game. It ALWAYS occurs when shots are being registered as hits between you or other players on screen, or during in game loading, and is not related to in game settings or gpu settings. This is a known bug that is affecting no small number of pc's. Single player runs well enough to enjoy, but I would hold off on purchasing for multiplayer until this is resolved as it is currently unplayable if you are unlucky enough to inherit this bug.Specs: gtx 970 ssc, I5-2500k 3.7 Ghz, 8gb ram, win 10"

												MP Review onlyso yeah. the game is fun at times. i wont lie about that. but there are some huge flaws in mp mechanics. but on the positive side, the game actually runs like a pc game. it doesnt feel ported untill you switch guns in your class setup. or vote on maps. etc.. the little things like that are pretty bad. graphics are decent. and runs well on my setup. but i have a high end pc, and set ups may vary.I7 3770k gtx 1080ti 16gb ram. average 120-220fps.. depends on the maps mostly. but runs well on near ultra settings.connection is pretty bad tho, and the jittering it causes in game is very annoying and i tend to leave when i did play.youll get players vanishing and re appearing just befor they kill you. stupid things like that. the game is on a 60hz tick, but when tested revealed to be around 10 to 30. depending on the connection. sniping is a tad op. and thats coming from a sniper, as i snipe alot. but i noticed when i wanted to reg gun how easy it was for me to die to nearly every sniper i ran into. needs some sort of nerf. not sure on what honestly because when i do snipe, i rather enjoy it.Skill Based Matchmaking is attrotious. they say there isnt any, but there is. the SBMM happens when you are in lobby most of the time. and if you are any good at the game you will notice, the game fills your own team with all the baddies and puts all the decent players on the other team. almost every match. this is the main flaw that made me quit the game. forcing me to carry the teams every match. i personally wouldnt re buy it knowing this. and i dont think ill ever buy another cod again. SBMM is the worst MP design in the history of gaming. if i wanted a challenge i would go playranked play. public open matches are for players to enjoy the game. if not removed. i will never buy cod again."

												- Not historically accurate but it is CoD so who cares, you play it for fun not for historical accuracy.- Not the best optimization but Campaign and Zombies generally never stutter. Multiplayer can sometimes.- Balance is generally good in the game, you can use almost any weapon in the game and still get kills if you're skilled enough with it. This means you get a lot less repetitive gameplay if you use a weapon that gives you a challenge.- No customization for the German Army in Multiplayer which sucks.- Whilst I've barely played 2 hours of the campaign, from what I've played it has been fun.- For some reason the game is split between Call of Duty: WW2 for campaign and then Call of Duty: WW2 - Multiplayer for Multiplayer/Zombies. It is unknown why but anyway.Overall it is a really good game and I recommend to anyone looking for a casual shooter.Edit: Since I have mostly played Multiplayer my hours don't show as it only shows campaign hours."

												The single player campaign is...fine. It's short, like most games these days. Where this game is truly bad is multiplayer. The map design and weapon balance is so poor it's not even remotely entertaining. Most maps are set up to be a spawn camper's paradise. It's truly amazing how poor the level design is. Matchmaking isn't any better, either. Never once have I been in a game that was even remotely close. It's really junk. I wasted $100 on this crap."

												This is pretty much a 50/50 for me. For the first time in a very long time, I actually had fun playing a Call of Duty game. That being said, I have an extremely hard time figuring out how it took three years to develop this game. Featuring nine maps, a little selection of weapons and the same 'feel' to it as games like BO3 and Adanced Warfare, it seems like they used three years on developing orders and assignments instead. Compare this game to so many others on the market, it really is simple and very casual. For a €60 game, this is certainly not worth the money. For all you get, it feels like a €40 game. On the bright side, again, I did have fun playing the multiplayer for a bit. The singleplayer seems very cinematic and challenging. Zombies is as always on point.If I have to give it a rating, it would be a 4-5/10.Get it when it's €40 or below."

												The game goes back to its roots, but if I have to be honest, for me its another game that lacks content. The multiplayer maps feel like arena fighting, and not a WW2 battle. The max people you can play is 12, and even on the biggest WAR mode, which feels a little bit empthy. The new mode, if I have to be honest is really good, but its only on 3 maps. The zombies mode on the other hand is done really good, with a lot of details, but during gameplay (for beginers that have never played it) is really hard to get coordinated or to understand what to do. Another game with potential, thats asking you to pay 2 times the game (Game and season pass) so you can have a normal full game."

												With the games current standing point I can say with most certainty that the game is not worth buying. Although there will be contridicting views on whether to get the game or not, there are too many bugs throughout the game, singleplayer and multiplayer alike to give this game a positive review at this space in time. Singleplayer  - Starting off with the singleplayer campaign, it is in my opinion a decently crafted storyline that successfully delivers real character developement and well as emotional and historical depth that many Call Of Duty games have lacked in the recent years. Singleplayer Bugs - Throughout many cutscenes and throughout sound heavy segments of the game, there can be some audio issues present which provides the game with cracking and popping sounds, especially when artillery is being fired or when there is intense battle noise in the fore and background. As well as this I experienced some not-so suble cutscene laggs and freezes which as a whole ruined the immersiveness of the story in many parts throughout the campaign. There still needs to be a lot of optimisation in order for the campaign to run smoothly, and before it is heavily patched it can be a drag to play.Multiplayer - Being brutally honest, it is in my opinion that the Multiplayer side of Call Of Duty WWII is in the most immediate need for attention, offering the largest assortment of hackers and bugs a like, making the multiplayer experience truly frustrating most of the time. With a few decent gameplay experiences, I can say however, that with time and if given enough effort and if the deveopers listen to enough community feedback, they can successfully make Multiplayer a great deal more successful and popular than it is currently.Multiplayer Bugs - When first joining a match already in progress, I always experience a great delay in data being present, leaving other players without a visible weapon in their hand for a good few minutes, leaving the user to wait for it all to load in, often dropping half way or at the end of a match. As well as this, there are still a great deal of rampant hackers loose, aimbotting and headshotting entire teams with one clip, leaving the match ultimately unenjoyable as there is nothing anyone can do until the match is over, often affecting peoples statistics and upsetting both teams and their players alike. When is comes to graphical side of the game, it is fairly pretty however in most cases and for most players the game is extreamly poorly optimised and leaves most players (including myself) dealing with lagg spikes, framerate drops and game freezes, even when being run on the lowest possible settings in all parametres. Another few smaller bugs to mention are when it comes to joining Headquaters, there is a possibility of being kicked for inactivity, although I hadn't even begun to load in yet. As well as this, I find myself being kicked for several matches every now and again because ""Connection lost to host"" even though my internet connection speed is adequate and suffers very few to no issues at all 99% of the time.(I have not played much of the Zombie's aspect of the game, however most of the bugs still greatly apply there as well)Overall Conclution - Although I did thoroughly enjoy the Campaign's Story and I have played a fair amount of multiplayer, the game's current status makes it not worth its money and unless some time is put into improving the game's performance as well as implimenting more free content for base line COD players, the game is not worth it's current price, and if you are deciding to buy the game, think about a 50% discount or less, or you are being robbed blind..."

												Consider i have only played ~6/7 SP missions and no MP yet.The graphics are great. Runs well, however some of the intro vidoes while loading look slightly less fluid (CPU and old I5 at ~4.4 struggles), but no hitching/stuttering/slowdowns during actual gameplay on very high graphics settings no matter the action.The story seems great so far however the missions are short.But the game is more frustrating then fun due to one awful mechanic.You need to move your mouse to a circle in about .5 second then press a hotkey to continue. If you don't than you immediately die and then have to watch the same stupid cutscene over and over again. Sounds easy just move your mouse!!. I keep getting stuck on this stupid mechanic and each time it appears in the game results in me closing it down as it takes several attempts every time :(I'm not 12 years old i don't have the reflexes to twitch into a spot instaneously.I haven't played COD since MW2, but played COD2 and 4 significantly. MW2 compaign was brilliant and gorgeous.This mechanic ruins the fun in the game for me and i'm not sure i will bother finishing the campaign.Other than that the mission where you have to fight the tanks is let down awfully by the most absurd stupid control system for a vehicle that I have ever witnessed in any game (movement/camera/control input).It's evident this game was not playtested by mainstream gamers.

												Framerate stutters and dips into the single digits frequently. The issue may hide for 1 or 2 matches online, but will always make its appearance soon after and stay until restarting the game. It ALWAYS occurs when shots are being registered as hits between you or other players on screen, or during in game loading, and is not related to in game settings or gpu settings. This is a known bug that is affecting no small number of pc's.

												MP Review onlyso yeah. the game is fun at times. i wont lie about that. but there are some huge flaws in mp mechanics. but on the positive side, the game actually runs like a pc game. it doesnt feel ported untill you switch guns in your class setup. or vote on maps. etc.. the little things like that are pretty bad. graphics are decent. and runs well on my setup. but i have a high end pc, and set ups may vary.I7 3770k gtx 1080ti 16gb ram. average 120-220fps.. depends on the maps mostly. but runs well on near ultra settings.connection is pretty bad tho, and the jittering it causes in game is very annoying and i tend to leave when i did play.youll get players vanishing and re appearing just befor they kill you. stupid things like that. the game is on a 60hz tick, but when tested revealed to be around 10 to 30. depending on the connection. sniping is a tad op. and thats coming from a sniper, as i snipe alot. but i noticed when i wanted to reg gun how easy it was for me to die to nearly every sniper i ran into. needs some sort of nerf. not sure on what honestly because when i do snipe, i rather enjoy it.Skill Based Matchmaking is attrotious. they say there isnt any, but there is. the SBMM happens when you are in lobby most of the time. and if you are any good at the game you will notice, the game fills your own team with all the baddies and puts all the decent players on the other team. almost every match. this is the main flaw that made me quit the game. forcing me to carry the teams every match. i personally wouldnt re buy it knowing this. and i dont think ill ever buy another cod again. SBMM is the worst MP design in the history of gaming. if i wanted a challenge i would go playranked play. public open matches are for players to enjoy the game. if not removed. i will never buy cod again."

The multiplayer hitboxes are absurd, you can kill everyone by just wildly shooting around even if you don't hit them by 40 cm's. That is if you don't get killed by some aimbot. Luckily choices to spray and play are limited because the amount of guns in multiplayer is very limited, don't get me started about the micro-transactions to buy weapons. Furthermore the campaign is lacking originality, it's as much blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up as possible and only consists of the battles in Western Europe. Compared to World at War it feels like a huge downgrade what could have been the comeback of the franchise. I'm dutch and only made the effort to write a review because I'm so let down by Call of Cuty.

												I expected a mediocre campaign but this was the best cod campaign I played and I played all of them. You probably think I lost my mind but these are the reasons:-In a cod campaign I want to have cool moments even if they are unrealistic (and most of them are). Like in Modern Warfare 2 there were levels with slow motion explosions and badass cutscenes. Those were the levels I did over and over again after I'd beaten the game. Not the boring escort levels. In this game all the levels have their badass moments. -The graphics are amazing. I played on all the settings set to ultra and this is the best looking fps I played.-You don't fight alone. In other cod games you usually get dropped somewhere and spent the rest of the level alone fighting against an army. In this game there are at least 5 people fighting with you and even if they don't help it feels much better to be part of a squad while fighting. It makes the war atmosphere much better."

No double jumping, no getting shot from above, etc. It finally is a game where better aim can get you somewhere again. The guns are fun and so far I have not really found something overpowered.The new war mode aka Overwatch mode is fun to play if your team doesn't suck and a nice addition to the classic modes.The zombie mode is fun as well and the campaign is okayish. The cinematics in the campaign look great but the gameplay is mediocre just like in the other CoDs.The biggest negative point I have with this game is that it tries way too hard to appeal to SJW standards. I mean, I get that you don't care about accuracy when it comes to the weapons so the game is fun... but really? Women fighting on all fronts? Black guys and women for the germans? Who the ♥♥♥♥ came up with that?"

												Wow actually i gave it a thumbs up, but now i gotta edit this review, so likeSo i actually was hyped for this game , Not since MW3 i was excided for a COD game! but my smile turned upside down intill i realised what i got for 60 dollars.The Single player seems kinda boring , i played the first 2 missions and its just like i don't know yet. When landing on Normandy beach i expected something like from a movie Saving Private Ryan but , like hell no! the who thing lasts 2 min and u ran across 3 trenches and you get into the bunkers lol. And Nazis use PPSHs instead of MP 40s , i found only 1 in that missons lmao. God historicly accurate right? i don't care about that black women nazis stuff in multiplayer but this is just bland. There is this Railshooter part in the first missions the whole thing looks like Rambo the video game lmao, jesus that was just cringe part.The MP is just oh god, 1 word boring as hell.I don't know why but the Beta seemed for fun and fast paced, Everygame i play i get like the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3 maps, that are too large and its only 6v6 , in TDM and Domination. I spend half the match runnig around trying people to kill, kill one guy run all the way to the other side of the map get another kill, camping would bore the hell out of you, and its just the same thing running around trying to find people then boom youre killed, running around some more boom killed again. Its just like something is missing in the game. game seems unfinished . AND 9 MP maps really? like cmon its getting boring so fast, they only added a few more guns since the beta and few more stuff , thats all i expected much more out of multiplayer, the WAR gamemode seems cool but also bland. The HQ mode is kinda cool , probably the coolest thing in multiplayer, but god THE PISTOL grip cases are amazing!! god thats bad. The Community will die out fast im sure on PC specially.I gave it a 8/10 before, but now it goes down to 4/10, just unfinished."

												Singleplayer was awesome.The visuals are amazing - standout is the flying levelSound is superb - hearing the dirt fall on my metal helmet was so intenseGameplay is typical COD but Im sure that is what you expectedMultiplayer needs a lot of work snipers are way to OP and quick scoping is way to EZ its a joke hit reg is terrible and I cant tell if its lag or just the game itselflevel design is really bad, way to small so simple, a lot of spawn killing Shame on me after 14 hours I'm almost ready to uninstallstill waiting on an update but as of now this is the worst multipalyer since the last sledgehammer gameAs of Dec,10 2017 there has been a 12GB patch yet the multiplayer servers are still bad.I have given up on the game for now and unistalled but, if there is a future patch to fix servers I might give it a second chance. Zombies is fun but with one level the fun will wear out quick and with the way the game is so far I will def not buy the season pass which in turn leads to an ever shorter lifespan for zombies"

												It's a great game.. Story mode is AMAZING.. Zombies is great, love the jump scares and what they did with new types of zombies.. But I was very dissapointed about multiplayer.. Only 6 maps not including war and dlc.. And not very many weapons.. As a zombie player I think the game is worth the money.. If they release custom zombies I would easily pay even more.. I hope they release free dlc for more weapons and maps.. But if not it's still a pretty good game.."

(For the record, I have over 100 hours in multiplayer. Less than 10 in campaign)All in all, its a good game. Most of the time.The campaign is beautiful and quite fun. Definitly worth a playthrough.I don't play zombies so can't speak for that.The multiplayer is a little broken, but still mostly playable. I would keep an eye out for when they really get it together, but for now its a lot of bad connections, empty HQs, and quite a few hackers. The multiplayer systems are definitly something to get used to, but works. Just needs some balancing here and there.The HQ is great, again, when it works.I personally do enjoy this game, it just needs quite a bit of work yet."

												This review focuses on multiplayer.  Your typical COD game with a WW2 skin.  Overall, fun. I would prefer this to exo suits.  Gameplay is more grounded and there aren't enemies in front, to the side, behind, and above you all at once.  Map design still suffers in my opinion.  I think the weak map design is the biggest flaw in COD nowadays.  Most maps in the game are small, circular environments that encourage close quarters combat and force firefights.  I prefer the larger maps in the series such as the quarry map from mw2 and array from black ops 1, but I think I'm in the minority there.  These larger maps made me feel like I had more of a chance especially in modes like search and destroy. I also thought the gameplay was more tactical with that map design.  As a side note, the time limit for S&D was reduced and I'm not a fan of that.  Overall, if you like COD and twitch shooters you will probably enjoy this.  I hope map design improves in dlc/future installments of the series.  No map is memorable to me and gameplay doesn't seem as tactical to me as it used to be.Simply, recommended if you still find some enjoyment playing past COD titles and not recommended if not."

												I am disappointed with this cod version.  Maps are too small, they feel like a 10-15 year old hallway map shooter (with nice eye candy graphics). The weapons are varied and nicely done, yet the game play feels too much of the same SMG rng, no matter the gametype. Might be good on xbox where expectations for real MP comp is low... but for PC this game is a pass...Also, the cheaters are very common, ridculously common for a new game.  You will find cheaters playing openly while discussing their cheats with other cheaters on the MP servers. A very poor multiplayer experience."

												20th January:I have played over 40 hours which it dosent seem to show on here for some reason but I can say that this is clearly one phenomenol game. ON CONSOLE! on PC trying to have a good multiplayer session feels like trying to plough a field with a fork... Zombies gets a thumbs up though as it's undeniably good and I personally like it a lot but I did buy it for the multiplayer which is shambolic and trying to get into a ranked match is near impossible for me it seems. Maybe pick it up in a sale if you're willing to gamble that the developers might fix this broken game.2nd February: Absolute trash, going downhill, lots and lots of hackers, ranked play completely unable to get a game most of the time, keeps crashing, goes out of fullscreen midgame and makes weird noises when pressing keyboard.

												I can't say anything positive about playing any mode in Call of Duty WW2. The multiplayer hitboxes are absurd, you can kill everyone by just wildly shooting around even if you don't hit them by 40 cm's. That is if you don't get killed by some aimbot. Luckily choices to spray and play are limited because the amount of guns in multiplayer is very limited, don't get me started about the micro-transactions to buy weapons. Furthermore the campaign is lacking originality, it's as much blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up as possible and only consists of the battles in Western Europe. Compared to World at War it feels like a huge downgrade what could have been the comeback of the franchise. I'm dutch and only made the effort to write a review because I'm so let down by Call of Cuty. Guess I'll wait for Battlefield to announce their WW2 shooter that will oblliterate the last remains of the Call of Duty franchise."

												the multiplayer is too hard, lv1 vs prestige masters and a lot of ugly cheaters that just ruining the game, and to get a good kill amount or even a fev kills you need to camp or concentrate 100% and that is not fun att all, the weaopons are not balanced and the game is kind of pay to win you can earn better weapons by opening crates and you get more by buying then, a question why make a game for 60£ and have further pay to win elements and more skins than weapons and like very very few weapons that is not fun att all. sledgehammer instead of fixing the game and make it even a bit more fun they focus on loot crates and exclusives like vinter packs, they spend more time on skins and crates and other things like clothes than making anti cheat systems and making the game blalnaced, gameplay beta and the rest like loot crates finnished.

Don't get me wrong, the number of cheaters in this game is absurd but even given that, it still seems like garbage hosts are to blame just as often. Nearly every other match has one or two people with red ping bars who are untouchable. Some cods seem to give a red hit marker when you get a kill. In this game I have to assume its a head shot. Still baffled how I come across an enemy from behind, get multiple red hit markers with an LMG then fall down dead. Killcam shows me firing around them while they casually put half a mag into my head. Hard to give a thumbs up to a game where I have 50D20U connection but somehow go from 25-3 to 3-25 from match to match because of impossible to kill players.

Campaign Review (6hrs on time of the review, not completed)Pros: Very immersive story You get really attached to the character Squad abilities are very fun to use, gives you an certain advantageGameplay in general is very greatCons : veteran difficulty is a little bit exagerated some times. AI is killing you through smokes which the idea of the smoke is blocking their view, kinda lame If you missed a memento, you cant really go back on your steps, you have to redo the missions from the beginning Multiplayer Review	 (96 hours on time of the review)Pros : Boots on ground, really happy that devs came back to the real call of duty roots. Fast-paced gameplay, no more big♥♥♥♥♥maps like in mw2 where people were camping with a thermal, the maps are really small compare to the other cods Guns are not ALL cool and good but it's WW2 era so of course, no SCAR or M4 in the gun list. They are very good in my opinion.Cons :  Maps are really bad. It's cool that they're small but the way that they are design is bad. A couple of maps are OKAY but i don't like half of them and im not someone difficult about that. Community is insanly toxic, i deactivated voice chat and text chat in the first 5 hours of gameplay It's PC so, be prepared to encounter hacks. Did not hear anything about ban wave but VAC is not flawless. If you encounter a hacker, report and leave the game. Nothing else to doI recommend the game for the multiplayer, Campaign is good, COD campaign are always very nice the play.I recommend to NOT buy this full price unless you have a good amount of Steam Credit. Use Third-Party Website or wait for a sale. Call of Duty franchise is really popular but i dont think 80 CAD$ is worth the game. And dont buy the season pass, waste of money as always. And dont purchase DLC, PC Playerbase is not enough big to have a lot of DLC player."

It feels and plays like a black ops game in some ways but in others feels like WaW. I don't know what to think about this game. At times i enjoy it, but at others its frustrating and spammy. Sidenote: honestly hackers arent that big of a problem lmao just leave the game they arent as common as people pretend.

												I'd honestly recommend this game for Zombie Mode, but I can't and I haven't been this intrigued by Zombie Mode since WaW/BO. The map they've come up with this time around is fun and interesting enough to keep me playing it over and over. Unfortunately, there are just too many connectivity issues and game crashing bugs. When you spend a good hour or more playing an endrenaline rush of a run in Zombie Mode and the connection just randomly gives up, it may sting the first time and maybe even a little more the second time, but after having it happen another five times you just want to give up on playing it altogether. It's a real shame the Season Pass is $50 too. With every addition of a new Zombie map, the already small community is divided up more and more, making matching up harder and harder for non-Season Pass owners. They seriously need to sort things out, and while they're at it they should do us Zombie Mode fans a favor and offer up a Zombie Mode version of the Season Pass for a cheaper price. I should also note that I think they've done an excellent job with bringing back the gritty atmosphere and graphics that WaW brought to the table. I still can't recommend the game though!"

												Single player is underwhelming. Buggy. Feels rushed. Story is garbage. Very Short  4-5 hours. If you want a good story shooter try Wolfenstein or Bioshock. If you want a polished shooter, try Wolfenstein, Doom, or Overwatch. If you want a realistic shooter, this is not it. How many shots to the head does it take to kill a Nazi? Aparently more then one even with a BAR.BugyGraphics throttle at the begining of cutscenes. Have to setup graphics just right if you using NVidia to avoid screen taring and the entire screen only using the green spectrum, very frusterating.Push to crouch constantly decides to switch to toggle crouch. Crouch often decides to prone. Prone often decides not to work."

												My Call of Duty: WWII reviewHere’s why I recommend it:My review will be done in five sections including:CampaignMultiplayerZombiesGraphics and performanceConclusion*SPOILERS*Campaign:Was a great overall story, it started out bland and generic. The few first few missions were boring if not utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ was just run and gun. The first few missions were so predictive honestly. It got good and exciting at the forth mission and my interest started to grow in the campaign. It only got better and better. At the end of the story it started to get so good and fun to play it and had me wanting more. I really wanted to know what happens next as it had me on the edge of my seat of which the first few missions lacked.Also, I would like to add from my experience DO NOT play on recruit even if you are relatively new to shooters on PC. Recruit lacks so much immersion. I would suggest playing on Hardened for the best immersion. Veteran is unfair in certain situations, but it is the best in my opinion.The story is about 7 hours long, so you’ll get enough play time. NOTE: I played on veteran difficulty, so times may differ. Talking about immersion, this Call of Duty had me fully immersed. All the gore and soldiers getting mowed down by a machine gun pit was horrifying, seeing people heads and limbs torn apart. One thing I hate is that it seems like Sledgehammer make these game for braindead people. In the game they give every step and way to go and I am not very fond about, that is one thing that made the game bad. One thing the game which is so repetitive and predictable was how you were the guy that kept doing everything, like everything. Clear every room, call in air support etc. And when another soldier gets ordered to do so, he dies, or something happens to him which is so predictable.The characters were a bit forgettable, but they were fine overall. It was kind of sad when Lt. Turner died while holding off the enemies as we retreated. The voice acting is fantastic in my opinion. Pierson showed real character as he was jerk to all his fellow soldiers and treated them like s***. Zussman, a fellow soldier which you become great friends with, was remember able, he was always there for you. The rest of the cast were pretty forgettable and boring in my opinion.The health system and how you get ammo, health packs, grenades and airstrikes were really innovative and something new, other than just waiting for your health to regen.But listen up this campaign is the best Call of Duty campaign if not the one of the best campaigns, at least story wise. Really loved the ending. All I can say is what a campaign!Multiplayer:I personally think this is the worst thing about the game. By saying it’s the worst thing about it doesn’t mean its utter s***. This is why:9 maps (Normally we get 11 – 12 maps) of which are kind of small. They are also not the best design wise. But they’re above average I’d say. 3 other maps for the game mode: WarThis is something else which is good but would likely get boring after a while.You also get your normal game modes like: Team Death Match, Free-for-all, Search and destroy, Domination, Capture the flag, Kill confirmed and Hardpoint. Nothing new there.Weapons are balanced. Except the BAR.This is what I absolutely hate. In custom games they added some new features for Cod Caster, but they removed a lot of settings like for example weapons, score streaks and gear restrictions. WHY? Just why? Disappointed.The sniping in this call of duty is so SO satisfiying, just love it.Overall, it’s okay its guess. A LOT better than the jump pack s*** in previous Call of Duty’s.Zombies:Although I haven’t played a lot of zombies, its looks so good. I love the gore personally. All the perks are still there they just mixed it up a little. The map is huge form what I seen. A lot of Easter eggs. Pack a Punch is still there. It’s also a lot harder, there are a lot more zombies in low rounds. You also get like 4 different zombies: Just your normal zombie, fast zombies which have less health but is fast, zombies which are strong that charge you if you damage them enough and have more health, then you get zombies like the Panzers from Black Ops 2 Origins (if you played it), basically  a huge zombie with a flamethrower. It’s also terrifying at times with jumps scares which gives it a bit more originality.Graphics and Performance:Graphics:All you need to know this game looks absolutely stunning on max settings and at 4k resolution. Has the best graphics of any Call of Duty. This Call of Duty’s graphics are on par or even in some cases better than Battlefield 1, Battlefield 1 has far better physics when it comes to the destruction of things.  The lighting and reflections are fantastic. The animations and facial animations are also very very good. On the other hand, the textures aren’t that great but it’s not that bad, just don’t go near textures for e.g. walls and the ground or you’ll see what I mean.Performance:It’s okay. It’s not badly optimized and it’s not good. I run a i7-6700K @ 4.5 GHz and a GTX 1080. I get around 130 fps average on max settings 1080p and get around 70 fps average in 4k maxed. It could’ve been worse.It has crashed multiple times on me. More than 10 times while playing the campaign and multiplayer. Zombies it has not crashed. But I fixed it by lowering my overlock on my GPU which seems to be too high for the engine to handle, overclock works fine with other titles.There are various graphics settings of which I am glad about.  In settings it shows the difference it will make in a preview of a certain area. For instance: Textures, you get low, medium, high and extra. In the preview you can see what changes for each setting.Other than that, I have nothing else to argue about.Conclusion:I would say for only the campaign it’s not really worth the $60 but with Zombies and Multiplayer it’s definitely worth it. Best Call of Duty game since BO2. Better than Ghosts, Advanced Warfare, Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare (which is f****** s*** other than its campaign which was decent)The main menu theme music is absoluty fantastic, could be the best theme music in any cod.I give the game a 7.5/10.Take what will out of this review, but I would recommend buying this game.EquinoX"

												COD WW2 is a step in the right direction for the COD series. Aside from a few annoyances in multiplayer, the game provides a worthwhile experience with plenty of new content. The campaign focuses on a group of American soldiers and their journey through the European theatre. At first i felt that the relationship between the soldiers was a little cheesy and I wondered why they were always bantering and following each other around like they were the new Suicide Squad or something. But after watching Band of Brothers for the first time i realised that ""Companies"" are a thing, and that it's normal for soldiers within a Company to have a lot of camaraderie. I've never played a COD game that had this type of dynamic in the campaign, so technically this is their most realistic campaign.The pre-rendered cut scenes that show up at the start of every mission are extremely realistic and a nice change of pace. But the in-game cut scenes are a drag especially when replaying the campaign for achievements. It would be nice to have an option to skip in-game cut scenes. In the end, the story was satisfying and memorable. It was coherent, and the characters ACTUALLY had story arcs. Other COD games try too hard to be epic. They go all over the world and show perspectives from a thousand different people which leaves no room for a good storyline to build up. I don't remember what COD5, MW2 or Black Ops were about at all. But i will always remember Daniels' storyline in COD WW2, his friendship with Zussman, his sacrifices, and his beef with Sgt Pierson. Moving on to the multiplayer...oh boy. The last COD game i owned was Black Ops 1, and it’s pretty clear that COD WW2 doesn’t use the same engine as older COD games. It uses the same engine as Advanced Warfare, which is terrible because that engine was suited for a futuristic game with jetpacks and exo-suites. Slapping a boots-on-the-ground WW2 game over that engine is a bad mix and makes the gameplay feel TOO fast paced even for COD. Players ZOOM around like they're sonic the ♥♥♥♥ing hedgehog, it’s now incredibly difficult to keep your aim on a player that is running across the screen, and close encounters in this game are a prime example of how flawed it is. Often times you and your opponent will rapidly strafe side to side, jump up and down and spray bullets at POINT BLANK range for 3+ seconds before anyone actually dies. This is something i rarely experienced in COD before and it’s ridiculous. Having the upper hand by shooting at your opponent first used to mean something, but now even if you start shooting at someone first they can RUN out of your line of fire at lightning speed and kill you. Players carrying melee weapons are also given a massive boost of speed and are essentially unstoppable at times. The gameplay feels too messy and for the first time ever i struggle to finish any match with more kills than deaths.  But on the plus side, one major improvement they have made is the addition of War mode. This is the best thing that has happened to COD since Nazi Zombies. In War, one team fights to defend an objective whilst the other team fights to capture or destroy it. If the defending team fails to defend an objective, a new objective appears further down the map and they are forced to fortify themselves around the new objective and defend it. This makes for really long and intense battles in the biggest maps COD has ever had. The attacking team really has to work together to push through the defending team. And the battles are always head to head, there is no opportunity for try-hards to flank around your team and get cheap kills from behind. This is the only time in COD WW2's multiplayer where the gameplay feels fair and enjoyable. But unfortunately none of the kills you get in War are counted towards your K/D which makes me wonder why the devs are stifling normal players who benefit from the strategic nature of War while only rewarding the try-hards who run around like headless chicken in regular game modes. Other new multiplayer features include Divisions which assign special features to your weapon classes, Supply Drops that give the player random cosmetic items like emblems and skins, and a shooting range where you can train and have small un-ranked 1v1 battles. The prestige system has also been revamped allowing you to prestige guns and divisions as well as your rank. This feature is completely useless because prestiging a division or a gun does absolutely nothing. There are a lot less weapons to choose form in this game compared to other COD games, but the devs make up for it by providing fictional variants of every gun that can be unlocked through Supply Drops and challenges. Finally, the Nazi Zombies mode in COD WW2 is a lot different from COD 5 and Black Ops. This time the easter eggs that used to be completely hidden are now primary objectives that are displayed as a checklist on the screen, and players can now assign certain power-ups to their characters which are activated when the power meter is full. These power-ups are extremely overpowered and make the game feel less intense or scary. The zombies this time are a lot tougher, but when you can literally activate infinite ammo for 3 minutes whenever you want, nothing really matters. It’s still pretty fun to play and a lot less frustrating than multiplayer, but the classic raw survival feel of the good old days just isn’t here anymore. If you're a military shooter fan, there’s no harm in picking this one up since there really aren’t any better alternatives besides Battlefield 1 (which isn’t on Steam). The game can be annoying sometimes but it isn't a waste of money and you'll probably find yourself coming back to it again and again for a very long time."

												I've seen a lot of complaints about this game, so let's try and iron a few out.1: ""The characters have little depth/backstory/are forgettable"". To some extent this is true, however if you paid attention in the first 5 mniutes of the campaign Daniels says something along the lines of ""Zussman was the only one i knew after basic"". This is really important for the context of the setting. Often in WW2 soldiers barely knew anyone after signing up or leaving training. Zussman is a main character along with Piersen, the rest are arguably supporting characters and excel at that role, providing a middle ground for dialogue between Daniels and Zussman as not to draw out a back and forth between 2 characters. The problem is everyone is so used to being forced to be attatched to a character for the cliche moment they eventually die and I think the devs were effective in avoiding this2: ""The campaign is too short"": This is the most true of the criticisms. They had a long time to get this sorted and a 6 hour campaign to cover the epic of World War Two is frankly not good enough. A lot of people called for a Russian campaign (i dont agree at all, its a very well covered front) and I personally would have liked to see a British story in Africa and Italy. I forgave them though because i spread playing the game out over a week (I played missions in Normandy one day, Paris the next and so forth"" and was ultilmately satisfied with how long it took me. At least how long it seemed to take me. But again, if this game is Call of Duty ""And this is World War Two"", it failed. 3: Political Correctness/Historical innacuracies: In campaign they got a lot right, even taught me a few things. Swastikas present for all you skinheads to gawp at. If you are so fragile that the occasional female yelling in multiplayer is enough to put you off how good the game is you may have to take a good look at yourself. Now to some of my own opinions, good and bad.Zombies: If you like very little team coordination, character personality and repetitive fetch quests, this is for you. It's a refresher of the zombies experience but I don't think it was entirely necessary to re-work some good parts of the gameplay (the pace of the game is so much faster than any other zombies experience, making it hard for you to focus on an objective or a particular area, also the current map is complicated and too compact for the behaviour of the zombies. If boarded windows were still a thing the game would be much better just to slow things down a bit)Graphics: It's a cinematic masterpiece but I think Modern Warfare Remastered looked better and the animations can sometimes be pure♥♥♥♥♥ A small step down from Infinite Warfare. Music: Wrong style. Some more instrumental to help emotion would be good. Also a step down from Infinite Warfare.Multiplayer/hackers/performance: Solid multiplayer. Good playerbase and (for better or worse) it isnt region locked. What i mean is (As an Australian) I can be in a lobby in Australia and have empty spots filled by Americans and vice versa. A problem with Infinite Warfare was if there was a hacker in my region i'd almost alwasy get a game with them but with this that chance is lessened and it means the community will survive longer. The bad is if you connect to a 300 ping server. I can't say the lag was that bad but it's definetly there. Also hackers are there but Infinite Warfare did very reliable ban wave support. Price: Don't buy it on steam, alwasy buy in store and try to get the season pass.Summary: 7/10. They delivered a solid PC game but the ever present hackers and lag will always cause frustration but i'm confident they will be sorted out."

												!Multiplayer Review!This game deserves a lot more than it's been getting.First of all, yes it is has a lot of bugs and glitches and all that but those will all go in time. The headquarters feature of this game where you actually go into a different world to do things, was a brilliant idea, and when i can't play a game because of issues i just find myself spending a lot of time in there. The game is actually really fun, despite a lot of the bad things, if you just play it you should find yourself having a lot of fun. The divisions system is cool and the way the whole class setup is different and a fun new experience.Now, there are also a fair few bad things about the game. I have run into quite a few hackers, but i have simply avoided them by pressing esc and leaving the match. Because I live in Australia, sometimes it is hard to find games and the game expands its search and finds me games a long way away. I end up sitting on 1 bar even though my ping is fine on other platforms. This isn't such a big problem as it doesn't happen tooo often.The maps in this game are definitely a big problem from where I see it. They have not done a good job at all with making it easy, when you peak a corner you will have a full 90 degree area that it is just chance if you place your crosshair where an enemy will be, the flows are not so great because of this. Spawns are too fixated the map Aachen is a perfect example of spawn camping, the spawns are so stubborn to move that you will end up spawning into gunfire. Most of the time the spawns will not change when they definitely should especially to make sure you spawn without enemies behind you.Overall, i have had so much fun in this game, complaining only made it less fun. I know the game is most likely going to improve over time, if it doesn't... Well...."

												I am enjoying playing this game quite a bit! I skipped the last 2 COD installments because I don't want to play space war games with jetpacks and nano crap and ""futuristic"" gizmos. This one is finally based on skill (except for snipers, more on that later). You, your boots, and your guns are all that there are. I love that. Now, for the drawbacks: The game is still having the glitches worked out with updates, as per usual. There are too few maps upon release, which is a bit of a drag, but that's just how it is. The three biggest drawbacks are as follows: 1) No server browser. You can't rent a server, you can't save favorite servers, you can't have a home for your clan... It's just not as involving as it would be. I would play this game a LOT more if there were a server browser. Period.    2) Snipers' hit markers are so insanely overcompensated! Quick Scopers don't even have to look through the scope to have the aim assist kick in. Also, shots when looking through the scope can entirely miss the target by a foot or more, and it still counts as a kill. I am hoping they will fix this in the future.   3) There is no Vote Kick option. This is a real drag for us PC folks, in that there is no way to get rid of wall hackers (of which there are plenty upon the date of this review). Please, please fix this problem.   The game itself is quite fun, and people are, for the most part, well-behaved. I do enjoy the fact that you can turn off voice chat...

												I think the multiplayer lead developer was a coked up 5 year old. Good singleplayer campaign, but the multiplayer is falling apart for me quickly. The maps are very,very small and with the terribly implemented rotating spawns in TDM the game is just a mess. Flanking the other team is near impossible and I have had the opposite team spawn right behind me many times. I think 95% of my deaths have been from 2-3 people shooting me from the side and back at the same time. You literally can't be staitonary for a second because several enemey players have no doubt spawned 5 feet from your back and sides, just run around like you're hair is on fire shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥ Couple that with rampant Hackers and constantly being shot when behind walls (DEsync not bullet penetration) I think the amount of times I can say WTF while playing multiplayer has reached it's limit. Wait for a 50% sale and buy it for the single player. It's a bummer because the game runs well for me, sounds and looks great. I enjoy the general gameplay but spawns,desync and hackers have ruined this game very quickly."

												i feel like battlefield 1 is a better pick if you are looking for a good ww game but for a cod game its not that bad. The multiplayer is basically the same thing over and over, and i feel like it's really easy to level up compared too battlefield 1. WW2 has very bad multiplayer maps and you feel like you're playing the same 3 maps, it's very bad. But War is a nice new gamemode that made the game better in my opinion and it also gives alot of xp but i mainly give it a bad score just cus its not a content heavy game."

												I had to let the single player version run for 5 mins so I could write this review:Why did I buy another COD game?The content is actually fun this year.  When the game works, it's pretty fun.But the developers suck.   Every time these idiots push out a new content patch, they break their game.  The most recent post just says they know it's broken, but they haven't fixed it.  They just point you to a reddit post talking about a ""work around"" in which you can open task manager in order to get the game to launch.Throw the fact that they still don't have dedicated servers on to the top of this♥♥♥♥♥♥pile and you've got your self a recipe for a refund.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this garbage even if they do learn how to release a patch without breaking their game."

												Going forward in the call of duty series i had low hopes for this game, Already seeing negative reviews i didn't hope for much, to my surprize i find the campaign to start off very strong. There are moments that leave you shocked, but most importantly involved, you're not just shooting your way through a level, you care about your squad mates and really are in tune with what's going on in the battlefield, towards the middle and end of it i found myself expecting a big ending that would conclude the story line and the war. But i must admit i was dissapointed with the ending and found myself wanting more. Was it a bad ending? not at all. Just not what i was expecting. moving onto multiplayer i find it to play like any cod game. Great. (without jetpacks and what not) Some maps are fast paced while others are bigger and streched out, some maps require you to think about where you need to focus your attention and not just run out and hope to get as many kills as you can in one life. with the added headquarters that's only the tip of the burge in terms of new content. There is SO MUCH TO DO. It's no longer about just leveling up and getting the best guns, it's so much more involving and really will keep you entertained for hours even after reaching the max rank. The new games modes also add a great twist to the game, really freshing up what we know and love about COD. Taking everything into consideration it's great fun and will have you wanting more. aside from some long loading times and some glitches it's not bad and i think anybody can pick this game up and have a blast. Even more so when we get it patched! Moving onto zombies  mode,  i myself love a good game of Zombies, ever since they came out with the zombies mode i always loved it and really liked the way the went with it (black ops 3 was kinda bland) Well have no fear because WW2 delievers greatly with this games zombies mode, i think the main focus for the team was making it more creepy and scary then previous games, going around corners Zombies will pop out of no where and a startaling zap of creepy music will play quickly, while your charicter screams in fear. flocks of crows will fly out of windows and burnt out trucks as you run past. The new fear factor really keeps you on your toes as you're running around the map, Zombies look great and sound even better. I don't think i've been more creeped out by a zombies mode then by this one. One thing i really like is the fact that there are highlighted missions for you and your squad to complete, It isn't just about surviving anymore and i think this is what keeps me coming back wanting more each game. a few things i wanna touch on are the cut scences, my god do they ever look real, They really hit the nail on the head with this game and my expectations got realined really quickly after a few hours of playing each mode. All and all i will be investing much more time into this years cod.  Great job!"

												When I heard that they would be trying to live up to the expectations of WaW I got super excited, 7 hours of campaign playing later I realize that was a mistake. The only real gore is in the cut scenes, the devs were too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to use swastikas on uniforms and the guns are all over the place. Why can I get a PPSH when there's not a single Russian in the entire game? It's not like a one-off German from the Eastern Front got repositioned and took it, they're abundant. The campaign itself isn't bad, if you don't mind the historical inaccuracies and the feeling of ending weeks early. You'll see what I mean at the end. The multiplayer is pretty basic, it's much harder to use the class system and if you're not good with SMG's then you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck because the way the maps are set up it's way too difficult to use scoped and iron sight rifles. Which sucks considering how not every single soldier was issued a smg in WW2. Maybe one day they'll release some decent maps but none came out with the game. Also DLC right off launch? and DLC that covers one of the biggest battles of the war nonetheless? That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

Outside of the campaign there aren't any offline challenges, which has been one of my favorite parts of earlier CoD games. The multiplayer gameplay is frantic, but feels odly old fashioned. I think CoD World at War is the better WWII game in the CoD franchise, which is surprising given how old it is now (it came out in 2008)."

												Historically and technically inaccurate. Did the developers bother consulting anyone with any historical or weapons knowledge? Russian weapons were not available on the beaches of Normandy. Two .306 or .45 rounds to the chest at 20 feet will stop anyone from shooting back, but not in this game where every German is apparently endowed with super powers or perhaps wearing invisible 100 lb armor. Other than the story and graphics, it's very disappointing with some truly irritating sections requiring strange key combinations that lend nothing to the gameplay. Maybe the next time, management should require that every developer go out into the field and fire some actual weapons. This is what happens when snowflakes make games."

												Had a lot of stuttering but turned some settings down and it runs smooth now. Single player campaign is actually enjoyable and changes the gameplay up every level. Stealth levels were annoying and out of place in this sort of game. characters are believable and bring forth their emotions just like real WW2 soldiers would have. The locations are a mix for me as I wished we had levels in Berlin but I really enjoyed Normendy which was ripped straight from saving private ryan.campaign: 8 Multiplayer is the usual call of duty flavour but its obsured that we only have 9 multiplayer maps and already played 4 of them from the beta so activision is being greedy as always. supply drops are always in your face and I they will add the function to buy them very soon with real money. I like the movement and gunplay and the mode war is excellent and adds a layer on some tactics if played well but there are only 3 maps for that mode so it will get old after a while. Multiplayer: 6 (would be 7 or 8 with more maps and less supply drops in your face) overall I cannot reccomend it unless you really want to play a high budget WW2 campaign and a little fun in multiplayer"

												Overall im pretty dissapointed with the game.  I only care about campaign and so far there are too many platformer sections and once you get to the tank battle the controls are an absolute abortion.  To add insult to injury, the game actually crashes if it detects cheatengine (if your inclined to just cheat through the horrific controls).To come up with amazingly bad controls and then go out of your way to prevent people from skipping your terrible design choice after dropping too much money on the title is just a giant FU to the customer.Sledgehammer games - go F yourself.On the positive side, the game is very pretty with an ok if not surprising story line (acting is a bit overdone) but in other news, winter is cold and summer is warm.Sledgehammer is the B team to Infinity Ward and it shows in this title.  If you want a polished SP campaign, pick up Star Wars Battlefront 2UPDATE:Finished the campaign and overall I enjoyed the story and progression but I still stand by a negative review.  To sum up the main problems:1)  Controls for tank and aircraft are amazingly bad2)  Too many frustrating stealth / quick time sections to the game.  I swear, it feels like a solid 3rd of the game is stealth / timed.  I don't hate stealth gameplay but it's not what im looking for when I fire up a CoD game set in WW2.3)  The acting of the characters was ok I guess but the writing really made me cringe in many places and I thought had already developed a complete immunity to video game acting / writing.At the end of the day, I can foresee replaying Battlefront 2 campaign many times but this may be the first CoD campaign I never revisit."

Campaign was a big letdown so far because of health packs instead of health regen which is anti-COD and the super annoying quicktime events which sometimes seem broken. Overall I would wait to see what Treyarch puts out next year."

												DO NOT BUY IT, DO NOT BUT IT, DO NOT BUY IT.I AM CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING OPTIONS TO GET A REFUND - IT IS THAT BAD.Okay... let us put aside the game play issues.  The fact that the map design is so poor that you just have to run and run until you are shot.  Let us put aside that combat is so random and that you can shoot an opponent multiple times and they shoot you once and POW, you are dead... or that when you watch killcam you realise that your guy did nothing, even though in your game you thought you shot off your gun multiple times...  Let not even concentrate on those things...Let us, instead, concentrate on the BIG problems, and with this game there is always a problem.1) You will spend a long time with you waiting to get into a game, it just takes ages.2) You might spend the first 30sec of t he game frozen, you can see other people playing and getting kills/killed but you will simply not be able to take part.3) The sound is rekt.  There is a constant stuttering and distortion that plays along with all the sound effects.. it is so distracting.4) Updates break the game 100%.  You spend half your time praying they update this broken piece of crap and then the other half cursing them when they do.5)  ATM on my Alienware 17 R3 w/ 1080ti in the Graphics Amp it does not work at all.  The load up screen alternates between 3fps and 50fps with the cursor disappearing and reappearing randomly.  It take 45sec to over a minute to align the cursor with the ""EXIT"" button, let alone play the damn game.COD ALWAYS SCREW YOU.  SERIOUSLY SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET SOME OTHER GAME.  ALL THIS HAS GOING FOR IS THAT WHEN IT DOES WORK IT LOOKS COOL... AND THAT GETS OLD VERY QUICKLY.  AT THE PRICE THAT THEY ARE ASKING, COMPARED TO WHAT YOU GET, THIS IS CRIMINAL."

												I've been a COD fan since COD Modern Warfare, was so excited for this game as it is going back to its roots *boots on the ground*. It plays wonderful, the weapons are great and it feels good, BUT it has a very poor connection, 95% of the games I play (and everyone I know) is very laggy and unplayable, the modes that can be played are TDM, Domination and War only, all other game modes are impossible to find lobbies for. I thought the connection issue is only because the release of the game and the servers are stressed but it’s not, it is getting worse each day and it is driving me crazy. Will wait a couple of days to see if they fix the connectivity issue if not I will refund it.To summarize it’s a wonderful unplayable game, NOT RECOMMENDED."

												Call of Duty returns once again however not as bad as I thought. I was skeptical because this game DID come from the devs behind AW but I gave it a chance. To someone like me who has not played COD since BO2, this game is solid. Single player looks great and is decent and multiplayer is just like COD (toxic and cancerous). The zombies are meh this time around (like BO3) and Weapon balancing for MP could be improved but all around, a solid game. Oh yeah, and supply drops are cosmetic for now :3-9/10"

												The single-player campaign is great.If you're mainly here for the multiplayer: DO. NOT.

They've had hundreds of developers working on this for three years, with a ton of base work already done for them, and the result is still a complete mess. There's barely any players, and a quarter of the people left playing are cheating freely. Netcode & hit registration is horrible(even in campaign offline), features are still ""coming soon,"" broken stat records, many broken challenges/orders/contracts that are braindead-easy to program, etc. etc.. there's just a colossal amount of things wrong with the game that would break the character limit for a Steam review if I listed them all. I don't even know where to begin with how bad the support for this game is, but I'm 100% positive that by the time the next CoD releases, there's going to be countless problems remaining in WWII multiplayer. Don't support Sledgehammer Games. They're already being paid way too much for this.Buy it if you want to question netcode and hit registration a hundred times within 2 hours of play. Buy it if you want to constantly question why the other player was able to see you twice as long as you were able to see them when that shouldn't be the case, sometimes giving you literally no chance to survive. Buy it if you want to shoot somebody 20 times before a shot registers, only for them to turn on you and instantly kill you with a worse weapon. Buy it if you want to deal with atrocious netcode and hackers simultaneously. Buy it if you want to deal with sub-par map design. Buy it if you don't value your mental health. Buy it if you have no standards."

												30 hours of gameplay in multiplayer and zombies. I can't beleive this game has a mixed rating on steam. Lag is the first thing you'll notice right before you get aim botted by all the hackers.There's not enough multiplayer maps so you end up playing the same map over and over again. Hit detection feels worst than any cod I've played and I'm just not a fan of how basic this years entry feels. Nothing special here, just another call of duty and another cash grab. Only thing redeeming about this game so far is zombies, which is pretty fun. But this game as a whole does not offer $60 worth of content or innovation. Activision: 1 Me: 0"

												Overall im pretty dissapointed with the game.  I only care about campaign and so far there are too many platformer sections and once you get to the tank battle the controls are an absolute abortion.  To add insult to injury, the game actually crashes if it detects cheatengine (if your inclined to just cheat through the horrific controls).To come up with amazingly bad controls and then go out of your way to prevent people from skipping your terrible design choice after dropping too much money on the title is just a giant FU to the customer.Sledgehammer games - go F yourself.On the positive side, the game is very pretty with an ok if not surprising story line (acting is a bit overdone) but in other news, winter is cold and summer is warm.Sledgehammer is the B team to Infinity Ward and it shows in this title.  If you want a polished SP campaign, pick up Star Wars Battlefront 2UPDATE:Finished the campaign and overall I enjoyed the story and progression but I still stand by a negative review.  To sum up the main problems:1)  Controls for tank and aircraft are amazingly bad2)  Too many frustrating stealth / quick time sections to the game.  I swear, it feels like a solid 3rd of the game is stealth / timed.  I don't hate stealth gameplay but it's not what im looking for when I fire up a CoD game set in WW2.3)  The acting of the characters was ok I guess but the writing really made me cringe in many places and I thought had already developed a complete immunity to video game acting / writing.At the end of the day, I can foresee replaying Battlefront 2 campaign many times but this may be the first CoD campaign I never revisit."

												Signed up for the beta and had the game installed on launch day, I've been able to play multiplayer only twice due to network issues. I've tried every possible firewall and router suggestion I could find to no avail.The two games I did manage to connect into it was okay at best. Older CoD titles did multiplayer much better. Why do I need to connect into a server (HQ) with other players just to access certain content?The maps are tiny and poorly designed, the guns are meh, and the general feel is the game is lacking. The first level of the campaign is okay but I don't feel like spending $80 on 6 or 7 hours of content... requested a refund."

												This is WW2 for dummies.  It's like a 4 year old designed it- ""I'm gonna be a german but with a british helmet, and a russian gun, and i can run really fast and shoot really accurately, and I'm really fast, and it takes 5 bullets to kill me.  And I have an ACOG scope.""  Why are there russian guns but no russians?Why are holographic sites an option?Every single gun fires and reloads ridiculously quickly.In multiplayer, any player can use any weapon, regardless of what side they are on.  Whats the point of playing German vs USA if both sides are using Russian SMGs, and the uniforms are so customized you can't tell who is who?I don't know who's responsible for these ridiculous features, but they should be ashamed.  COD 1, 2, and 5 were great games.  This?  This is WW2 for dummies.  Most disappointing of all is the lack of modders to fix this thing.  PLEEEEEEASE give me a tactical realism mod.  It's what extended the life of COD2 for years.  And for god sakes give us some maps where rifles make more sense than submachine guns."

(for real 50€ and even at this price it's a thief act)_ You need to install the solo and then you need to install the multi seperated but you can't buy only multi._ Map creators team need really to be changed because the major parts of maps are really not liked by a tons of players from the game.How it's possible , 2017 and a AAA could have all thoses problems.I think the game still not totally horrible if you like chain die and a recoil of weapons worst than in beta phase (it's only my opinion on this point I think weapons was more fun in beta phase)."

Buy it if you want to deal with atrocious netcode and hackers simultaneously. Buy it if you want to deal with sub-par map design. Buy it if you don't value your mental health. Buy it if you have no standards."

												If you plan on playing only zombies then the game is okay. It has a fun map and good design. It also didn’t throw in a super boss zombie that can’t be killed but comes back every round so that is a plus.Sadly the multiplayer sucks unless you plan on using a controller or have above 140 fps. The aiming with the mouse is horrible and has weird acceleration that makes you skip around when you aim. AND YOU CANT TURN IT OFF! I went back to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 because of how bad this multiplayer is."

												Campaign is boring, zombies is ok, multiplayer is a complete mess. If you should happen to see an enemy player you're already dead on your screen, but on their's you've been standing there like an idiot for 5 seconds so they have all the time in the world to line up a perfect headshot. Never had this problem in any other cod. Waste of money."

												Despite having an incredibly interesting take on the HQ as a world hub to choose what to do, which I found quite cute and a nice change of pace from just a basic screen, the game was still lack luster. The stand out of this game is the zombies, which is incredibly well done, from the methods of progression, to the zombie design, and the new additions to the gameplay reflected well with the aesthetic. The only thing I have to say about the campaign is it's just dull.  Multiplayer (other than the HQ) is the same as every call of duty, horrible spawn points, look box based cosmetic drops, etc. I mean, if you like call of duty, and the horrid community, than you'll probably enjoy this game. I bought it out of nostalgia for WaW, which was a mistake on my part. I refunded it after the horrid 3 hour delay on launch night, and the 5 minute long load screens."

												At first I really liked the game, but I think just that it was boots on the ground and had a ww2 setting made me think it was a better game than it really was.After about two months or so the gameplay came really stale, you kept playing the same maps (out of the 9 ""standard"" maps there aren't really that many good ones) and it quickly became repetive. Sledgehammer also took a lot of time to fix the ""game breaking"" bugs so that didn't really help anything.Don't want to write a long review at all so to wrap my thoughts up, this game really lacks base game content and those lootboxes aren't as good as we thought they were, it's still filled with some useless junk like in BO3 and previous games."

												CAMPAIGN-After beating the campaign I can say I enjoyed this game very much. Though it may not be 100% historically accurate it was still fun to play and had very well created maps, and for once in a COD game a good stealth mechanic, but I do wish it could have been implimented into other missions. The team feeling of this game is great I finally feel like a soldier fight along with his comrades instead of a one man super soldier plowing my way through waves of enemies. I had no trouble running the game whatsoever, not one crash or freeze, though I found some of the controls to be a bit of a pain it was nothing a little bit of rebinding couldnt handle. There weren't a lot of missions or maps to play and it wasn't a very long game but the maps were very well designed and well thought out. And finally the health regen mechanic has been tossed aside and replaced with a much better med-kit healing mechanic which is great and something that should have been done a long tim ago. I found myself worrying about my teammates whenever something would happen and wondering ""Oh my god are they going to die"". All the main members of the platoon where memorable and i was able to create a bit of an emotional attachment to them. Overall I would very much recommend this game to anyone who isn't going to bash it about historical accuracy (and that's coming from a heavy World War 2 enthusiast) just play it and have fun ;).MULTIPLAYER- The multiplayer in this game is the same as most other COD games but with a more old fashioned feel (which I am a fan of). There is also the implamentation of an HQ in the game where you can upgrade your character with different emblems, and also receive feild orders to complete in matches to recive rewards like extra credits or supply crates with special camos and emotes for your character. It is a fun experience and i wil be playing it for a while.ZOMBIES- The nazi zombies mode in this game is phenomenal, the map design and gameplay are great and the textures look amazing. It is by far the scariest zombies experience I have had in a COD game and I love it. The characters are fun to play and each have unique voice lines and personalities (my favourite is Drostan) PS- For the people out there wondering what the soviet PPSh-41 is doing on the beaches of Normandy, it's because the germans used that along with the Schmeisser MP-40, Sturmgewehr 44 (StG 44), and the fallschirmjagergewehr 42 (FG 42) submachine guns during D-day.

												Trash, rubbish, simple arcade shooter game with no strategy behind the game. Maybe for kids old enough to play shooters but this leaves you wondering what you have done with the money. The Multiplayer maps are small and very flat, one dimensional. The game play and movement is really poor. Geting killed with a shovel seems to happen alot. Sniper is overused and really spoils it, watching the replay seems like getting out of the way of a shot doesnt matter, I am sure I took cover, nope died anyway. Getting cover in the online play and poking your head out is awful. Ok I could have given it more time and got better but I have played enough of these fps over the years and notice there is nothing in terms of gameplay to even make me want to get better... this game is just poor and seems like a way for the company to make easy money.The graphics are pretty but I have seen better. It doesn't add to the game. Overall frustration level high, new modes in online play interesting but the size of the maps and the overall game play ruins it anyway. The single player held my attention for a while but after a while you notice you things repeat. Or the outcome repeats. If your just looking for point and spray with no real skill..go ahead. Older players wont like the arcade play and frustration will set in very quickly on these small maps. Pity, I enjoyed the first serious of these games."

I've won CTF like 5 times and didn't get my order finished. You can dolphin dive and get back up sprinting like it was nothing. I have seen this be abused so much, it's ridiculous. HEAVY DESYNC IN THIS GAME. I watch a sniper's POV and they shoot me after I'm behind a wall. On the note on walls, YOU CAN WALL BANG ANYTHING! I LITERALLY SAT IN THE MAP BREAKOUT ON WAR AND WALLBANGED THE WHOLE TEAM. They thought I was hacking... but in reality, I was wall banging them through cobble. Also on the map, there are tents in which the bullet can go through the wall, through a tent and kill you. You can literally get extended mags and faster reload perk and sit in a corner and wall bang anyone. There are way more glitches and exploits and cons about this game.

The return to the WWII period enticed me enough to purchase my first CoD game since the original Modern Warfare, but I'd be trying to get a refund right now if I weren't already past the time limit."

												The game is very graphically inclined and beautiful yet easy to run, however there are many glaring issues that highly out weigh the positives, the cons are just to much to recommend spending 60+$ on this title Pros :) ------- The game looks amazing and can be ran on my friends gtx 760, runs fantastic on my 1050ti and all round is apealing to the eye with a phenomanol color scheme the gun play and combat can be entertaining for a little while, the campaign is not to hard to beat, the fastest any of my group of friends have completed it while skipping the cutscenes they can and just going straight to the mission objective was 2.5 hours, however he said it was a great time and a rush, so I can see that as a pro I guess, the multiplayer modes and in game, is not bad, but there are cons to it, and the zombies is definitely where the cons are about to start.... CONS :) ------ A title that is not only triple A but has loads to gain and profit on does not have it's own servers for zombies, people host, same in multiplayer, try having a man with FOUR HUNDERED plus ping host when your average is about twenty five, ♥♥♥♥ing great am I right? we got to round 90 and I ranked up insanely high however the ""host"" decided to randomly leave without telling us and upon his disconnect we also left the server, we assumed it would not be a HUGE deal since we earned all of our time right? NOPE HOURS WASTED as we sat in the main menu the fact that we just lost all of that Experience and time and leaderboard stats were totally gone and vanished from the internet forever, internal sadness literal want to end my existnce  HONEST RATE After going back and fourth between my options I would say I rate it at about a 4/10 which is crazy because I normally love Cod, I have every game dating back to the original on my PS2"

												Same game with the same problems that all other Call of Duty games have:-SMGs still run rampant more than any other weapon type.-Quickscoping is still here-Questionable hit boxes are still here-Boring campaign that uses the same tired tropes we have seen before.-Zombies mode that brags about more horror, but ultimately failed to deliver on that promise, becoming another run-of-the-mill zombies mode we have seen before.All in all, this is not worth your time if you are looking for a different COD experience. If all the things I listed wrong about these games are actually positives on your list, then more power to you... I guess."

												CAMPAIGN-After beating the campaign I can say I enjoyed this game very much. Though it may not be 100% historically accurate it was still fun to play and had very well created maps, and for once in a COD game a good stealth mechanic, but I do wish it could have been implimented into other missions. The team feeling of this game is great I finally feel like a soldier fight along with his comrades instead of a one man super soldier plowing my way through waves of enemies. I had no trouble running the game whatsoever, not one crash or freeze, though I found some of the controls to be a bit of a pain it was nothing a little bit of rebinding couldnt handle. There weren't a lot of missions or maps to play and it wasn't a very long game but the maps were very well designed and well thought out. And finally the health regen mechanic has been tossed aside and replaced with a much better med-kit healing mechanic which is great and something that should have been done a long tim ago. I found myself worrying about my teammates whenever something would happen and wondering ""Oh my god are they going to die"". All the main members of the platoon where memorable and i was able to create a bit of an emotional attachment to them. Overall I would very much recommend this game to anyone who isn't going to bash it about historical accuracy (and that's coming from a heavy World War 2 enthusiast) just play it and have fun ;).MULTIPLAYER- The multiplayer in this game is the same as most other COD games but with a more old fashioned feel (which I am a fan of). There is also the implamentation of an HQ in the game where you can upgrade your character with different emblems, and also receive feild orders to complete in matches to recive rewards like extra credits or supply crates with special camos and emotes for your character. It is a fun experience and i wil be playing it for a while.ZOMBIES- The nazi zombies mode in this game is phenomenal, the map design and gameplay are great and the textures look amazing. It is by far the scariest zombies experience I have had in a COD game and I love it. The characters are fun to play and each have unique voice lines and personalities (my favourite is Drostan) PS- For the people out there wondering what the soviet PPSh-41 is doing on the beaches of Normandy, it's because the germans used that along with the Schmeisser MP-40, Sturmgewehr 44 (StG 44), and the fallschirmjagergewehr 42 (FG 42) submachine guns during D-day. Sorry I noticed some people complaining about this and had to say something."

												Yeah, wow. Full metal disappointment. Same CoD as 10 years ago, just with better graphics (though not much better than BF1). Same bunny hoping, dolphin diving, quick scoping that I gave up years ago in favour of teamwork and tactics of Red Orchestra. Was hoping for some real WWII with modern graphics, but instead, got a boring run-and-gun 6-on-6 mini-squad, tiny-map, micro wank.  Played multiplayter for 3 hours first night, and found absolutely nothing rewarding enough to make me want to come back again. Forced myself to try again the second night, War mode is kind of cool and unique, but the hackers and quick scopers ruin that too. Yes, BF1 has all that too, but at  least there are large maps and large teams that offer a variety of strategy, tactics, play styles, and vehicles. CoD WWII is just the same run-and-gun, full clip spray-and-side-dodge as it's always been. Just with better shadows and mesh detail. Wow. I think I hang my WWII boots up at this point. (Unless Sniper Elite IV introduces a MP+bots mode!).  It's now the third night, and I'm not going back to CoD..."

												This is why you shoud / shoudn't buy COD WWIIStory+It's a good story.+The new lead your squad system is pretty good.-Maybe could've been longer.-And sometimes the squad system bugs out.-And the ''Saving a fallen team mate'' is buggy aswell cause they fall in the middle of the field and you need to get him behind cover and it's almost a suicide mission everytime.MultiplayerThe ''BAR'' for balance has been set pretty high xD+HQ has fun things to do, and the scorestreak training is pretty good.+WAR mode is great 3 maps so far which gives diffrent objectives.+The weapon varients are good the 10% / 15% xp bonus is nice (Some give guns in zombies a upgrade).+The supply drop thing isn't that bad for a daily grinder like me i have atleast 1 varient for each weapon to use.+The ''Old School games'' are okay.. maybe they shoud cost 100 credits and be unlocked forever instead of 10 each time.-But sadly Smg's got nerfed and now the most used weapons are STG and BAR.-There is no reason to use smg's anymore cause the STG and BAR have better hipfire and less recoil and more damage.Zombies+The new ''create a class'' system is amazing.+The new ''Lab'' is good aswell.+The map ''The Final Reich'' is great.+They made a normal easter egg which is eazy for casual zombie players.+They also made a hardcore easter egg for the hardcore easter egg hunters.+The secret charaters are nice.+And you can get weapon varients from supply drops which give a small bonus.-But the leveling is slow.+Bonus the map you unlock when completing 1 of the 2 easter eggs ''gröesten haus'' is great for leveling and the 2 easter eggs (the box and pack a punch) make it a fun map.And that's it hope this guide was usefull for why you shoud / shoudn't get COD WWII"

												Quick review, I have played COD ever since the original but skipped the last few.Bought on day one as I really wanted a WW2 shooter with decent graphics and multiplayer.Played on an i5 6600k OC1070OC16GB of Ballistix DDR4Asus 144hz G Sync MonitorProsCampaign is quite decent with good visuals on ultra settings.Multiplayer is varied with plenty to do.Game plays best on veteran difficulty.Sniper is very rewarding.Some nice dismemberment but not consistent.ConsPeformance issues with random stuttering throughout the campaign despite over 100+ fps.Quick Time Events leave you extremely frustrated and serve no purpose.Your teammates in the campaign literally let enemys run through them.Returning grenades can be a pain.Game goes for way over the top political correctness (we get it you have to make an african american and a women the heros whilst making every german soldier look like a movie villian).Multiplayer feels same old.Controls on the flying mission are shockingly bad.Good game but the peformance issues, forced political correctness and innacuracies with the history are a bit of a let down. Still recommened as I am enjoying the campaign and the multiplayer is still decent, play on Veteran."

The graphics are so amazing, the sounds and gun sounds etc are perfect, It's my new favouite game and i'm going to be playing it a lot. It's much better then the beta, devs fixed a lot in the game after beta finished and it's so much better, I move around much better in maps and and not slow movement, It feels a lot better now and appreciate the devs for doing thier best and fixing the problems and thank you to the devs for putting thier best effort in and making campaign so good and interesting! Honestly i'd recommend this game to people who really would enjoy it playing it, campaign is fun as and heaps good. It doesn't feel clumsy anymore in multi as well, I knew the campaign would start on D-Day and the first mission was so much fun and good to play, can't wait to play the rest of campaign and play more multi and also zombies soon!

If they do not release dedicated servers, I would not recommend buying this game. If they do sometime or another launch dedicated servers that will change everything and make this one of my most played games.Please Activision don't let us all down - WE WANT DEDICATED SERVERS IN WWII !!"

												Finished the campaigne last night. And wow this was one of the campaigne that I felt connected with the characters and one of the most enjoyable campaigne since MW3. The graphics for a COD are really ♥♥♥♥ing good. But the optimization is a little wack, but hopefully eith some updates that stuff gets fixed. I loved the weapon variant in the campaigne. On to the multiplayer. ever since Black Ops I never really enjoyed COD multiplayer and now that they went back to WW2 I actually enjoy it. From the customization to the headquaters. Zombies is authentic like WAW besides the customization. But in all honesty It's a little scary especially with the mini bosses. Like the zombie with the club for an arm and the giant guy with the flamethrower. Overall I give this a 9.5/10. Is there splitscreen for this game?

With the Divisions idea i actual like it, its a step away from the Original Create a class setup, theres no perks in theroy, but division perks, and everyone is the same, at 1 point of the game, Zombies, I havent played much of zombies but the parts I have played it was pretty good, the only thing I dislike right now is that the leaderboards dont always update, I manage to get to round 54 and yet it did not save the rounds, and not put me on the leaderboards."

												This game could be lot of fun.  COULD.  Yet it is not.  For two reasons.  1) It is a console game and has ZERO support for PC.  Two ""fix"" patches have been released for console and none for PC.  Not even a mention on when PC could expect them.  2) Rampant cheating on PC.  Zero bans or any form of anti cheat a month in.  Every single lobby has hackers in it now.  There is zero reason to play. Which brings me to my 3rd point.  There are at peak play times 25K worldwide.  This playerbase ranks just below CIV 5.  Last but not least their micro-transaction mechanism is broken.  It will take your money, but if it doesnt deliver you are out of luck.  Activision support will not help you.  So dont bother.I bought this game hoping that the WW2 material would match the fun I had in WaW.  I havent played a COD since MW.  Now i remember why.  most emphatically do NOT recommend."

												Call of Duty: WWII is not a great COD game, not even close. But it is the best WW2 FPS game at the moment, which we haven't got a decent one for years. It has every pros and cons that every COD had, and yes it's fun as hell.The biggest innovation of WWII is the Division system, there are 5 divisions you can pick, and each of them has four different perks, so you can't freely customize your perks and your play style is pretty limited. If you want to attach the suppressor on your SMG, then you have to pick Airborn division, if you want to move silently and be invisible in enemy minimap or scorestreak, you have to pick Mountain division, you can't have them both. With this, there are quite less campers in the game, much less than I expected.Sldgehammer did pretty good job on weapon balance, everyone has their own favourite guns, some people say that STG.44 is overpowered, some people say that Bar is overpowered, and some people say that PPsh is over powered, that's actually a sign of a good weapon balance, just pick a weapon which suits your play style. One thing I want to complain about is the double barrel shotgun, there are two double barrel shotguns in the game, both of them are brocken - they are too weak, with only 2 magazine capability, they should be one shot kill in close range, but mostly they don't, even with incendary shells euiped. I know it's for weapon balance, but they don't have to make double barrel shotguns such pethetic.And of couse there has to be supply drops in the game, it's 2017, so get over with it."

												Played it for two hours then got a refund. Crap graphics and sound effects, linear as hell monotonous gameplay we have all seen a thousand times before. However I'm sure 10 year olds who have never played the earlier games will lap it up. As for multiplayer, its nothing but a cheat and hacker fest. Zombie mode seemed ok but not paying £45 just for that.If you have not played COD WaW, released in 2008, buy that instead, it puts this pile of crap to shame."

												I like it, It's fun.Sure it's not historically accurate, but you can kinda get over that stuff in the multiplayer and just view it as a ""fantasized/fictional World War II game"". The multiplayer overall is just fun, nothing else. I didn't really feel as captivated or immersed as other historical war shooters like DOI, BF1, and Red Orchestra. Some of the maps are just weird, but I do like the new ""War"" gamemode and the ""Hardcore"" mode seems very balanced. The servers with typical game matchmaking seem fine to me, but headquarters still seem very abandoned which was one thing I was really looking foward to since the trailer had up to 48 players in a cool socialized place. Granted, the servers are getting better day after day, for me. I know a lot of other people, especially in other countries outside of the US are having much more troubling problems with servers, which is a bummer.The campaign was fun too, it was your typical ""extreme WW2 story"" with a bunch of cliche's and scences copied from films and TV shows, but that description wasn't that far off from all the WW2 games back in the early 2000's. I thought it was a nice story, kind of refreshing the whole WW2 games from the 2000's with the better graphics and overall AAA quality. The only gripe is that the Germans had PPSH's, and most of the combat was pretty linear and I didn't get to explore as much as I wanted to with the very beautiful scenery in the missions of the game.The graphics are very good, but they seem to be consuming a lot more preformance then I would like. Many people would assume a Call of Duty game wouldn't be as power consuming or graphically intensive as other games, so they would try to play with less preforming systems just like the previous games. Unfourtentely that's not the case, I had a pretty tough time running with just 8GB of RAM with my i5 6400 and the GTX 970. The preformance is usually consuming a lot of RAM and CPU power. My CPU wasn't capped at 100% usage like other systems, but it was somewhere around the 80-90% mark. I used to have 8GB of dual channel DDR4 RAM, but it was stuttering a lot and very unplayable, so I just slapped on a 4GB stick in the 3rd slot (since their recommended specs is 12GB of RAM, oddly enough) and it worked! Even though the RAM channels might be a bit messed up with that 3rd slot, but I just had that random stick lying around and plan on upgrading to 16GB. But it was quiet strange seeing that most of the stuttering and lag problems people are having are RAM related issues, and really need to upgrade to more than 8GB of RAM. Other than that, the GPU wasn't stressed at all and ran just fine with the textures and anti-aliasing on high.Zombies, in my opinion, were better than BO3's. Black Ops 3's zombies were just complicated and a bit weird to me with all the steampunk mix-mashed with futuristic stuff, but a lot of people did like BO3's zombies. WW2's zombies seem more refined and a bit more emphasizes on the actual zombies being Nazi's in the historical time period. The zombies are pretty scary and there are variating kinds of zombies you can fight. The 1 map (without DLC) is pretty nice, but I would like to see the classics from WaW come, without DLC. The single map still kept that World War 2 time period atmosphere like I used to love. I didn't like the whole story line and I often skipped the cutscenes, they felt out of place and outright cringy. Also, I wish there were more characters, the 4 characters are fine but I didn't see a typical American soldier. The melee is interesting but there should be more melee animations then just shoveling their head off.I'm usually not a Call of Duty player, so I'm not a Call of Duty fanboy at all. If I were to play a AAA FPS game, I would play Battlefield, but I play a lot of realistic, tactical based indie shooters like Squad, DOI, and Onward. But Call of Duty's formula with 3 different modes all refreshing the player to keep playing the same game was a joy to play for me. The campaign is definitely worth replaying and very cinematic. The multiplayer is outright fun, the supply drops don't seem to be balanced and aren't able to buy with real money (for now), there is a lot of customization and the headquaters are pretty cool. The zombies are nice to see and it's pretty scary, but the mode seems a bit rushed.There is a lot of controversy revolving around the game, mostly being historically accurate and favoring more towards the SJW's and equality with video games. To be honest, I think everyone is overracting with woman soldiers being in the game. I'm not apart of the SJW community and I understand what everyone is saying with Call of Duty implementing a more diverse array of player customization to the game, but it's still a video game from Call of Duty. A series known to blowing the whole warfare definition out of proportion and making the player seem that you can get out of every sticky situation by hitting a few buttons and blowing up a few enemies. The woman soldiers, at first, did offend me a bit in the multiplayer, since I'm used to seeing an M1 Garand in my hand, with a familiar WW2 map scene, with other male soldiers fighting along with me, then just hearing the female screaming ""I'm reloading"" or something else really high pitched like they actually fought along side with men in the exact same battles and the exact same scenerios as men in WW2. Granted, woman did serve in the fighting lines in WW2, but very rarely and only in Russia I think. But over time, I quickly got used to the idea that this was only apparant in multiplayer, which was just a fictional spin off of WW2. The swastika censoring was just annoying in the multiplayer, but I did see it in the campaign. I'm not sure if this was purely a ""German import"" issue just to make the game easier to make or whatnot, but I was still annoyed with the innacurate German uniforms and censorship of swastikas at first. Overall, if you're not a huge stickler about historical accuracy in simple video games that are set in a historical time periods, these things will be noticable but can be ignored very easily and just put aside to enjoy the purely fun fictionlized WW2 time period the multiplayer/zombies has to offer.Overall I would recommend this game to any Call of Duty fan, the controversy seems to be just an overreaction and don't make the game inherintly bad. Sure the woman soldiers might be a little off-setting at first but it can be ignored effortlessly and the swastikas are there in the campaign, which does add a bit more historical sense in the campaign. I know my hours are short but I did consume a lot of time in the open beta and I plan to play this game more.The game is just fun, if you like to have fun and don't care about historical accuracy or any other kind of controversial ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, then you will enjoy this game."

												Because this is a AAA title it is criticized with more scutiny than other titles. This COD is CLUNKY in campaign not to mention not being able to use the mouse in the menu and having to actually take a hand from its rightful place to hit ENTER, how does small stuff like this happen in 2017??. Having to be perfectly aligned to do most interactions in game, using heavy artillery having no effect on the mission because you didn't advance your position, which is the only way to progress other wise it seems like infinite enemies spawn (I get the point for storyline purposes but if you can clear enemy because you are a good shot it should allow for easier movement closer from a realism perspective and they are trying to put us into WW2 right?) Alas, they used the money on scanning a real life actors face and using his voice for some odd reason instead of making a more solid campaign, which we all know isnt the focus of the game (Multiplayer). This still saddens me as storytelling is going by the wayside from COD to focus on microtransactions and making money for less quality that we used to see in titles of old. The differences in mouse sensitivity for the action scenes versus the normal game is insane (default sensitivity) and has me using more than my 10 inches wide of mousepad to perform them. The sneak missions are by far the best thought out, but please fix the driving which is like driving a car on oiled ice. The campaign is shorter than you want and no reward in Multi for Campaign? Not even skins? Meh.Overall Campaign score 4/10Multiplayer is what you expect from COD, hands down PC probably lacks tuning because it was a PC port and controls with mouse and keyboard may be less forgiving. Once you dial in your preferred settings and learn the maps its fun in the climb for prestige. There is pay to have an advantage in buying the DLC package but eventually you can catch up without spending extra $. Zombies is good if you have friends to play with. Multiplayer score: 6/10Leaves a bad taste in your mouth but its COD so you prestige for something to do. Least there is plenty of people on the servers, even if ""hacks"" are out already and ""lag compensation"" is absolutely an abomination. I can't prove either of these exist but you'll believe it soon enough.Total Score: 4/10 its par for the course of AAA title letting us down and I already played too much for refund. Don't buy unless you are playing for multiplayer and even if on PC controller might be better. Will I get $60 value from it, with friends the answer is undoubtedly yes.PS yes its two separate installs on steam, no they cant be on separate storage because they share content to run but either standalone works great....just make it one install...maybe?"

												Got this for Christmas that's why it's recieved for free. Campaign- 8/10 Excellent Story & Characters. Tried too hard to be emotional and heroic moments are cheesy as. Didn't like seeing russian weapons on the western front like having mass amounts of SVT-40's and PPSH-41's. Love the new features in campaign. Great weapon variety & I felt like my squad was alive and had personality. Zombies- 9/10 Excellent gameplay & (not really for me as nothing in games scares me) scarier than any zombie experience before hand. As an OG zombie veteran since Cod W@W.  Great characters as well. Starting map not quite as cool as Shadows of Evil but it's solid. MP however is garbage. 3/10- Trash You can pay $85 (AUD)  to play with: Tryhards, Hackers, Campers, Headglitchers, AND most of all, QUICKSCOPING. There are 3-5 snipers every game rushing spawns with the crazy fast ADS time. The maps are terrible and cater to campers & snipers. The streaks are♥♥♥♥♥♥ The gun balance is horrible. How do you ♥♥♥♥ up a WW2 game? If you're SledgeHammer games. If you say sniping is not op you might have brain damage. However when there's none of these around. The game is actually really fun. However that is sadly 1/10 of the time. Fix your terrible MP experience SledgeHammer. 3 strikes & you're out. AW- Trash, WW2- trash & whatever you make next if it sucks. Nobody will buy your games ever againSave your $ folks. I'd rather enclose my scrotum in a DVD case than pay my own $ for this garbage MP experience."

												For a Call of Duty game, I would say it definitely is one of the better ones. Sledgehammer made sure to really put the heroic and ""Above the Call of Duty"" vibe into the campaign while also telling a story that you would maybe see in a WWII action film; it also has one of the best stealth missions I have seen in a call of duty. The multiplayer, despite one server hiccup I encountered, is fun and fast-paced; although some weapons are being neglected for better alternatives, so the balance is still getting there in that aspect. The zombies is very well done and fun to play with a group, they really brought the grotesque and terror aspect back to zombies versus the wacky direction it was going in for other titles.(although zombies in the 2nd World War is already a far-out concept alone) Overall I would say Call of Duty WWII is a title you should definitely pick up to revisit the 2nd World War and enjoy yourself while doing so.P.S: I set aside the historical inaccuracies for the review because I don't solely buy games based off whether or not ""they are not wearing the right uniforms"" or because ""this gun doesn't load like that."" Overall, sledgehammer tried their hardest to make it both fun and fitting to the era."

												Finally a great CoD game again! runs smooth and I've only experienced 1 crash so far. played campaign to part 3, good so far. haven't played zombies yet. MP is what it is, good old cod style like world at war with minor new stuff, only thing worth mention is the new HQ where you can socialize or interact with other players, play 1v1 go practice aim, do missions etc. that was kinda cool i think. the cons of the game must be the movement feels a litte off, but i think i will get used to it. the tickrate feels kinda weird or something, feel like im dying when i run behind a wall or maybe its just lag I don't know. but its early and i hope devs will sort this out, other than that its a great game.played on GTX 1070 with i7 6700k"

												So far I am thoroughly enjoying the Single Player experience for COD WW2 and though I feel that the fights are kinda on the short side the game is still pretty dang epic and the story is pretty good. Multiplayer has some major kinks that they need to flush out, not sure if it happens to anyone else but sometimes my game would just freeze and sometimes get sticky keys where my character just runs forward continiously for no reason. (and yes I turned off my sticky keys) Zombies on the other hand is pretty interesting, I haven't really gone past round 25 since it gets very hard and pretty damn hectic at that point and most of my teammates are struggling to survive like I am. It does give me vibes of the old Zombies but at the same time the new mini bosses they implemented in this one makes the game  more challenging and really forces your friends to TRY to not LEAVE anyone behind. for me all in all im enjoying the game for what it is and yes I do get frustrated with the lag and server problems they get from time to time but for the most part the game works and im having fun with it."

TLDR:The same COD formula with some new additions to the MP and zombies experience with a significantly improved supply drop system. One of the best campaigns of the series, by far, but if you just want to buy the game, it is worth it, but I would wait for a sale.To Adress The Performance Issues:The game  does suffer from some stuttering at max settings but I turned down the AA and some post-pr0ccessing effects such as subsurface-scattering and I get between 60-80 frames per second (Specs listed below) in the campaign. The multiplayer and zombies also seem to run significanlty better due to the lack of set peices and dozens of AI.The Campaign  The campaign has a solid story with the classic COD formula but a bit more grit and less of the super soldier feel. I love the new health pack system, which helps to prevent you running around like a crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥and acually adds some ""groundness"" to the combat. This campaign is some good Call of Duty fun for a few hours with improved graphics and mechanics and the same great gun play.Multiplayer  Some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t COD MP with hyper active, ADD-style, mechanics and supply drops. There is a substantial improvement to the supply drop system with the ability to earn them from chalanges and get random drops every few games. The headquaters are an interesting social area, basically a copy of Destiny's tower, I found it a bit of fun and a much more enticing way to get new challenges, open supply drops (you can watch each other as it's done by throwing a moke grenade in the headquaters :D XD), look at the leaderboard, etc. If you've played COD before, you know what you're getting ere.Zombies  A very simialar experience to previous games with the addition of some new types of zombies and some features such as the new power-ups. The new horrow vibe with the awsome zombie models and graphics is great and just makes it generally a bit more ""cool."" Basically the same but refreshed and new with some sick voice acting from the likes of David Tennant and still a ball with some mates.

												Story is very nice, pretty short but the most problematic thing in this game is the multiplayer.lags everywhere, in every game - what will be with this game and its developers who continue to use players as hosts?2 days straight playing with continious lags in 90% of the games and its furying.except that, zombies mode is nice and fun but also the multiplayer effect of player-hosts is still infectious and bad to every gamer around who bought this game."

												Completed Review:Campaign overall was very good. It took me around 5 hours to beat which left me wanting more. I really enjoyed some of the characters, and the fact that you didn't always play as infantry all the time (Tanks and Aircraft). The campaign is more difficult then some of the previous Call of Dutys. You need medic packs and ammo to come from fellow squad mates which makes for an interesting dynamic. I was blown away by the first DDay mission, I can't imagine what they went through. Minor historical accuracies, but its a CoD. I don't want to give away spoilers for the campaign so I'll leave the campaign with an 8/10.Multiplayer is fun, it's the same fast paced CoD as always. Most of the multiplayer mods everyone is familar with (TDM, Domination, Search and Destroy, Free for All). Their are only 9 maps (10 if you count Carentan which is for season pass holders only). All and most of the maps are kinda small, my biggest regret with these is lack of more maps and some larger ones.  The highlights are the unique wargame mode, and the headquarters area on Utah beach.  War is by far the best and most unique mode. You work with a team trying to complete objectives as attackers, and the defenders try and stop you. They can be escorted tanks or destroying ammo dumps. Each game you flip so you get to try attacking and defending. My biggest complaint is only 3 maps for war, and any additionals you will need the season pass for. The headquarters area is awesome, you can shoot targets, get daily challenges, test score streaks and 1v1 other players. If the multiplayer had more maps and more War maps specifically at launch I could give it a solid full score, but it leaves me with an overall: 8/10 for multiplayer.Zombies are a blast, they are scary and more interesting then previous games. The map has sections to unlock and hidden objectives to do to make you last longer against the undead. I don't want to spoil to much here but i'll give it a 9/10. It's not the best for zombies in a game I have played (Favorite of mine is the zombie army trilogy) but it stays true to zombies in CoD in general. Overall game I would give a score of 8/10. If you enjoy fast paced multiplayer CoD is known for then invest. If not, then dont waste your money."

												The singleplayer campaign isn't really about WWII, it's about how friendship between adult men requires both great sacrifice and a great aim. It turns a global catastrophe into a melodramatic test of camaraderie, more concerned with making you feel cool than bogging anyone down with historical context. This isn't the powerful history lesson for future generations it was first billed as. This is another Call of Duty campaign, replete with slow crawl concussion scenes and cornfed soldiers.Call of Duty: WWII stops feeling historical beyond appearances pretty quickly.WWII’s competitive multiplayer benefits most from the return to a simpler setting, focusing on map awareness and reaction time. With the removal of jetpacks and wall-running (THANK GOD), it’s difficult to dance your way out of a bad decision. If you’re not paying attention to enemy positions on your radar, bouncing between loadouts to counter enemy team compositions, or can’t point and click on a moving smudge of brown from 50 yards off within a second, then Call of Duty: WWII can be a rough time. I love that maps are crowded and force frequent tests of these skills. Designed around three lanes tangled with flanking routes and sniper perches, death comes from everywhere, all the time. Call of Duty: WWII’s multiplayer recalls the glory days of Modern Warfare, I'd recommend it to anybody. I just wouldn't recommend the campaign..."

The campaign is one of the best in Call of Duty, intense battles, gripping scenes, and fully devolped characters, make for an exciting, entertaining storytelling experience.The zombies gamemode is HANDS DOWN the best itteration of zombies since Black Ops 1. Very fun to play with friends and an interesting story line to boot.I think with a few QoL (Quality of life) changes and bug fixing, this game is well on its way to be a Call of Duty remembered as one of the best. If you're a fan of Call of Duty, I would say  BUY THIS GAME"

												Political and historical correctness aside:I think if you enjoyed black ops 2 you will enjoy this game. It's not completely WaW and it's not completely BO2, but it does meet somewhere in between in terms of gameplay (on multiplayer at least, not sure about campaign.It is great fun to play with your friends, especially war. The buildling animations are just f**king hilarious I love it.Yeah I didn't jump on the bandwagon of hate for historical incorrectness, burn me on a stake.Although that shouldn't be forgiven this isn't a BAD GAME. The multiplayer is probably the most fun I've had since BO2 and that's why I'm giving it a thumbs up. FINAL NOTE: Although I enjoyed it, you really shouldn't support some of the crap they pulled. This is only really a buy if you have friends to play with and you enjoy going into multiplayer and f**king sh*t up. SUMMARY: It's a guilty buy, it really is.

Definitely not worth the price they're asking for.

												I don’t understand the hate tbh. The game did not have the best launch, but that doesn’t mean the game is bad. Some games have had worse launches and look where they have come “Battlefield 4”.  Anyway I do know that there are some inaccuracies in the campaign like the Germans having ppsh’s on D-Day and I agree that’s crap, but they could easily fix this with a patch. Also I hear complaining about reflex sights about how they didn’t exist yet, but they were invented in 1900 by Howard Grubb. Also reflex sights were in Call of Duty World at War and no one cared about them then, so why do you care now. This game is in no way perfect, there are definitely problems but I feel like it’s a big step in the right direction for call of duty. Hopefully they keep working on WWII with updates and free content. I would probably rate this game a good 7/10. If anyone disagrees with me or agrees with me on anything, message me."

												I will completely admit at first that the last Call of Duty title that I played was Black Ops when it released. After deciding to hop back into the game with WWII I can say I am slightly dissapointed. Not necessarily with the game but how it works now. First of all the campaign itself was beutiful. I always enjoy games with ones like this. A nice story to tell, looks great, and can be repeated to try different routes. (Or what might seem like different routes at first glance).Next I decided to try my hand at Multiplayer. First game I think I went 0/9? I dont know if this is just me being extremely rusty from not being in the franchise for so long but something felt majorly off. Everyone seemed to know exactly what they were doing and have really strong guns only a couple days after lauch. Common example, walk around a corner, see and enemy, get gunned down before I can even aim down my sights, rinse, repeat, try enemy tactics, get killed some more. My last little point in this is about Zombies. This wouldve been the saving grace for me but unfortunately I cannot seem to enjoy a single game of zombies because I keep getting ""Kicked out"" in the middle of games. And I say kicked out while the game says I have lost internet connection when I have not? I can head online and stream 1080 videos just fine. Play PvP multiplayer for hours just fine (Aside from getting my♥♥♥♥♥eaten by every single other godsend player in the game) and everything EXCEPT Zombies. Which is a shame, it looked fun, seemed to have a good story and I was looking forward to leveling my character but alas I cant, -1 star.So this is my short and crappy review. I kinda feel bad for buying the game but that is my own fault. My hopes were extremely high just to be smashed into the ground. I give it... 1 McDonalds Cheeseburger."

Zombies is fantastic, I love that they took a chance to redo it and they nailed the horror aspect perfectly, campaign is also interesting as well but have only played the first 3 acts so cant have that much of an impression yet.

												Thougt I'd write a review for this game since people are hating it before even looking at trailers. Campaign - Not only one of the best COD campaigns I've played but also in my top FPS campaigns I've ever played. The game is absolutely beautifull. Got goosebumps in the end scenes. Story is great. Truly captured what really happened during WW2. I run a gtx 1060 6gb 17-7700k and had no problems with fps. Constant 80-100 fps sometimes getting up to 120. Some cutscenes seems to be stuck on 30 fps though. Multiplayer - I needed a break from the same old PUBG. So I bought this for the multiplayer ready to refund within the first 2 hours because it's ""the same COD game from 6 years ago"". Wrong. The gameplay feels really good with satisfying hitmarkers. FPS is fine. No stutters or drops. Gotta say though, you're going to struggle to get kills if you don't have the ""rush b with a smg build"". You get insta killed trying to snipe a smg pushing you. It's a brand new COD. If you want to play COD. Buy the game simple as that. Don't hate on it cause it's ""just another COD"". I had the same mindset.Zombies - Zombies I barely touched but the zombies have a nazi theme. There are also a few different zombies and they'll get your heart racing a bit I guarantee it.Overall I'm really happy with the game. Got exactly what I bought. A brand new beautifull looking, satisfying Call of Duty.9/10"

												I’m going to give you guys a very honest and un-biased review. I have only played call of duty ww1, Blackops 2 and 3, and that’s it. I basically ignored all the COD games after BO3. I did this for good reason; they were playing with very dangerous waters without thinking about what makes COD good. In doing so they ruined there reputation, not only that but they lost the trust their fans had because of this mistake and decisions. They even lost me to the point where I wasn’t going to spend a penny on another call of duty game again. BUT I took a chance with this COD and I have to say I love it. Yes it is a twitch shooter; yes it is very linear with run in the mill gameplay. But let me tell you something, if after BO3 they released this game instead of their parkour simulators it would have been a smash hit. Think about it, it has every aspect of a COD game and even more. The supply crates for now are purely for aesthetic, and you can get them for free by completing objectives which makes the game even more interesting. Enough rambling, let me get on to the Pros and Cons to my honest review.Pros:-Campaign is really immersive, telling a good story in a very decent way. Each mission is different and has its own unique feel to it, sometimes even making your heart race as everything and everyone is coming at you. -I don’t care what anyone has to say, I set this game in medium and ultra-settings and both presets look amazing. It might be the same engine but with the increase foliage and new textures it looks stunning at times. -Zombies mode is stunning, fun, and immersive. They made zombies even scarier than ever, with a mini quest line as you survive waves upon waves of zombies, new bosses, also new animations and sound ques that sometimes scares the living hell out of you. Cons:-Servers are some of the worst I have seen in a game, consistent hit registry is complete CRAP, sometimes the network connection is so bad I have people drop shooting me while their bodies float to the heavens above.-Gameplay is a run in the mill shooter, with twitch style play. This can either be a pro or a con to some. At times you will get bored of the lack of team play and constant complaining teammates. But hey that’s what makes COD, COD. With all of that said, COD screwed itself into making every game they make heavily criticized. In my book I give this game a solid 8/10. It has a very immersive and interesting campaign, a run in the mill shooter multiplayer with consistent challenges and game modes, and a fantastic scary zombies mode that will make you and your friends really enjoy playing together. The servers are not that great, it has some linear competative play but most people only see the bad in this game, but there’s plenty good to see. Too some this game maybe super overpriced because of its 50$ dlc price point, but thats for over a year worth of maps and new modes and who knows what. I highly suggest purchasing this game at a 40 or 50$ pricepoint if you are scepticale, but for some 60$ is nothing for a aaa COD game.

I do feel like you can rush through these missions very fast if you like playing like that, even at my pace which i would consider fast i found each mission lasted around 20-40 minutes depending on how many times ive died. this is all i have for now but i would still recomend this game so far for the story"

												This is a first impression review from my first 10ish hours of gameplay. (TFW you need 5 minutes on the single player to write a review but you have 2)This game is a step up from the past 3 years of Call of Duty. It is a good entry out of the horror that was ""Exo Movement"". In no way, in any shape or form, does this game stand up to some of the classic COD games, but it has some unique details that provide for a decent gameplay experience. 1. Multiplayer, from my standpoint, if very fun. A nice refreshing taste2. Zombies. It's okay. I like the objective based gameplay. Better than IW and AW zombies.3. Havent played campaign so refer to other reviews.My favorite feature is the Headquarters. Oh my, I thought that was going to be horrible, but it works quite nicely. You can 1v1, check challenges, and much more in a nice package. The one thing I dislike is how little maps there are off release. Like I get you split war and the other maps up, but I feel like it's going to get repetitive after a while. Overall, if you want to get it and you liked old school cods, then it's a unique pickup, especially if you play with friends. Definitely not a ""you must get this right now"" game for sure.

												Probably one of the worst Multiplayer Experiences I've ever been a part of.- Multiplayer Display Mode never saves (Fullscreen, Windowed, Boarderless)- Field of View (FOV) ALWAYS resets whenever you launch the game.- Hit registration (Probably due to P2P) is absolutely terrible, can put 6-7 rounds into a guys chest from an Assault Rifle / SMG only to have the guy turn around and two shot me in the feet with a PPSH or something.- Setting Scoreboard to ""Hold to Show Score"" actually enables the Scoreboard ""on"" until you press and hold the scoreboard hotkey to make it disappear.- Absolutely terrible host selection, been connected to numerous people in the middle of the day where everyone is red ping with 1 guy on 3 green.- Multiplayer ""Flare"" literally looks like a frigging sun, I say Praise Jesus every time someone throws one because its like the second coming.Pluses?Campaign was pretty good."

												Finished the singleplayer(It's a bit dull) & have been playing the multiplayer for 7 hours by now. I've read the negative reviews and i don't know what these dumb kids are talking about.I'm playing it on I5-4460, gtx 1060, 8gb ram on the highest setting and running it stuck on 63 FPS (vsync on) without any stutters. I recommend you disable the GTAO High ambient occlusion for better FPS. The multiplayer is like every CoD ever- run and gun with perks/new weapons/attachments.

												TL;DR: I'm dissapointed. I would have preferred CoD2 with updated graphics over this. Other reviewers with less than an hour gameplay complaining there are no swastikas and that the game has sold out for political correctness haven't reached later levels depicting german war crimes, civilian and POW executions, swastikas-a-plenty, and an implied/mildly explicit sexual assault of a female captive by a german officer.I've played through a majority of the campaign on veteran difficulty. Beating old school CoD2, WaW, and CoD4 on veteran were some of the gaming highlights of my youth, and I wanted to recapture that.I'm fairly dissappointed, I was full hype mode for the game and feel like I have been let down. Unsurprisingly.The CoD2 (2005) campaign is far, far, far superior to this showing. Both in narrative, delivery, even characters. The CoD2 campaign took place on multiple fronts, and multiple continents really giving a sense of scale to the conflict. While I get that the story here tried for focus on one squad's journey, I feel like it was an immensely poor attempt to recreate the breakout sucess of a 'quirky squad' from BF: Bad Company 1. The squad characters in CoDWW2 even mirror BFBC's squad with alarming similarity.Others have commented on the vast swaths of historical inaccuracies. I am no expert on Nazi uniforms, but I was surprised to find Russian guns on the beaches of Normandy. A lot of people have commented on the lack of swastikas as an attempt to make the game more politically correct, or that the developers are too afraid to show swastikas--I assure you I don't think that is the case. There are many in the later levels of the campaign. The Paris level german HQ has many. Additionally, there is a pretty heavily implied sexual assault of a female french resistance fighter. I don't feel like punches are pulled unnecessarily just for ""inclusion"" as the other reviewers are commenting.TL;DR2 Ultimately it's a next gen WW2 game, I would like to see more WW2 games, and the best way to achieve that is to show support for the genre with my wallet. If you are pinched for cash and only plan to buy a game or two at release this year, skip this. It really is the same old CoD recpie with a WW2 face. But, if you have a little disposable income, love WW2 games, and want a decent FPS campaign I don't regret buying this for full price, and there is really nothing objectively wrong with the game, or the campaign. I just wish they had gone a different direction with narrative, and choice of battles."

												The Campaign is spot on, bringing back the good old days of Call Of Duty 2: Big Red One. There are many haters in the Reviews section and most of them are complaining that their potato not being able to run a simple game.The Multiplayer though, it's always filled with toxicity. But I'm giving this game a recommendation just for the Campaign."

												While CoD: WWII is by no means a bad game, it isn't particularly good either. However it is definetely a step in the right direction for the franchise. The reason behind why I won't recommend this game as of right now is its extremely steep pricetag considering that the campaign is over in 5-6 hours. On top of that the Nazi Zombies mode is not as groundbreaking as I had hoped, taking into account the enourmous amount of emphasis the devs put into saying ""it's different"". It just isn't. This leaves behind a game with a very short campaign, a Nazi Zombies mode which isn't really different at all and the multiplayer mode which is alright. All in all this game is extremely overpriced at 60 euros without season pass or DLC, the game in its current state is worth around 40 euros (without DLC/Season pass) MAXIMUM.Oh yeah, I also refunded since there are better games out there which deliver more for less."

												As I haven't played much yet, I can say that my experiance so far has been very good. Multiplayer is fantastic with the boots on the ground combat and classic ww2 weapons. For some people the ''no swastika problem'' is a huge deal for them, but for me I don't really care. There's like 2 maps that feature iron ctosses instead of swastikas and that doesn't ruin the game for me. The multiplayer is still very unrealistic with weapon camos, red dot sights and different skins on soldiers, so the iron crosses doesn't bother me at all. In campaign however, the historical accuracy is very important, and I fell like sledgehammer really did it. The first mission really took my breath away and I really felt the urge to rush overt hat beach. The only unrealistic thing I have found yet is that you can pick up MG42's and use them yourself which I feel is a little unrealistic. I also want to adress all the crying about PPSh's being found on DDay. If you haven't read history, the germans captured and used those smg's from the eastern front and used them themselves because they found them very good. There weren't that many used thought, which you can see in teh campaign. I only found 3 rifles out of hundreds of dead german bodies. --UPDATE--So after playing a few more hours I think it's time to review it. (Please excuse any missspelling, I'm too tired to read it all through.)MULTIPLAYER:After 3 years, activision has finally launched a CoD game that is boots on the ground based, instead of Star Wars based. I really think that SHG has done a great job with the movement. It finally feels realistic and not something taken from titanfall. Thought there is some problems with it, the main things taht makes this MP good for me is the weapons, maps, unlockables and so on, and these things are here. The only problems there is must be the removal of swastikas, unrealistic soldiers and unhistorical map locations that makes it unhistorical. But hey, I don't care. The MP is already, and has already been unrealistic. You heal like wolverine, take part in battles that never happened, use weapons that rarly is being used in combat and so on. So for me, teh problems that are set in MP isn't a great deal for me. However, it only comes with 9 normal maps and 3 war maps. I really would like more, especially war as it makes teh game more interesting and fun.NAZI ZOMBIES:It's ok. I mean, nothing can beat treyarchs zombies mode, but this one feels pretty good. Zombies are scary, weapons are cool, theres alot of perks, the withcoming map is big and great and so on. The thing I dislike thought is the amount of maps. I would liek atleas 2 maps with this mode, and 1 seems pretty basic. Zombies is something I won't play alot of in this game. CAMPAIGN:I haven't finished it yet, but I can pretty much already say that it's easily one of the best ones. From the first mission when you storm normandy I knew that it would be a great journey. And it doesn't seem short either. It's also very historically accurate, with teh right weapons, people, places and obviously swastikas! It really makes it feel real, and the story itself really drives it all forward with the player feeling the urge to know more on whats gonna happen to them. the campaign is great, thats enough said.(Bugs I've found after review was written)- Servers keep closing while and right after games, not giving me the xp I got from teh match.- My pc bluescreened while playing campaign, no idea why. (It has never bluescreened before.)- Supplydrops given when leveled up takes time to get into my inventory.- After prestige, my svt 40 class resets to having a m1941 after a game, which makes me have to change it between every game.- Uniforms used in a different class gets used in a different one without me changing it.I want to point out that bugs and other problems like that doesn't bother me as they can be fixed by the developers. Too much critic and rage about it shouldn't be given right at launch either, but they should be mentioned so that the developers get to know about them.The game is good, compared to the resent cod games. I will give it 77% / 100%, compared to the other cod games. But for people who aren't cod fans and want to buy this game, I would give it a 65% / 100% as those people will be mad about it being to fast pased and non historical."

Refunded and the balance of the refund will be to buy Wolfenstein 2 :  DLC.The bad AI, scripted old school animations from the 90s, the ridiculous PSH-41 guns on the germans in the trenches, and slow MG42 made me request the refund button.

We do not see our reviews as a review, neither should you, it is in the end totally up to you to decide whether this Game appeals to your needs as a gamer or not, we urge you, not to let our experience guide you to whether you have to purchase a Game yes or no!Therefore this is purely the personal Experience of the author for this specific title, treat it as such! Closing Comments:First off, both Call of Duty 2 and Medal Of Honor are more historically accurate than this game, weapons were more correctly portraited than in this title, with that out of the way I know some of you will say yes but this is just a game, however, when your marketing campaign is aimed towards historically correctness and you implement several scenes which are questionable.I wonder, with what kind of respect do you approach those that really fought in that war, while you, as a Developer and Publisher shamelessly claimed to add historical events to the Game!I ended up with a lot of facepalming and disbelieves and I felt more engaged in a one-hour engagement in COD2 than on an 8-hour campaign course on Call Of Duty World War II ""on Veteran Difficulty"" and that means something in my book!While this Franchise desperately needed a change they ended up with not changing a lot, yes it is true they changed the health regeneration which was a welcome aspect of the gameplay but that small change was overly overshadowed by the overly scripted events throughout the entire campaign.I have to agree that the graphics, sound and even the voice acting were tremendously well done, but, the campaign story and narrative of it all falls short, there is no meaningful connection between the character in the story and the battlefield.Both the enemy and the friendly AI are often unresponsive to one and another and if they do respond it feels like they have rubber bullets.It feels and it plays all like fill up where you end up being targetted all the time even when you shouldn't be targetted at all! I can't stress this out hard enough but your squad members often don't move up and this doesn't feel right on a large battlefield like this, weapons are not correctly portrayed, uniforms are censored and Activision has taken away all the historical aspects of the real event!To Conclude: Liberating Paris and ending it with fireworks, really now Activision? You should be ashamed of yourselves!!! ^.^[/code]PROS: Qualtiy Sound Superb Graphics Lip Sync is one of the best It looks like a nine-hour movie Thumbs up for the voice acting!CONS: Shallow and uninteresting Story Cinemtic events are often intrusive Multiplayer maps are too small and boring Friendly AI are unresponsive where it matters The enemy AI is unchallenging even on Veteran!  Category Rating   Narrative: 5.8 / 10   Flexibility: 4.0 / 10   Gameplay: 6.5 / 10   Rewarding: 5.2 / 10   Challenging: 6.2 / 10   My final score: 5.5 / 10 For the full review please visit my personal review site: Call Of Duty World War II Review @[mygamexp.net] you are most welcome to share your thoughts over there :DBest of regards"

												Was loving the game up until the tank mission in the campaign. Absolute joke, cannot complete the mission unless I go out and buy a controller. You're required to flank an enemy tank, however it takes about 30 mouse movements to rotate the tank turret 90 degrees and by the time you've done so, the enemy tank has been facing you again for about 30 seconds.

												2 problems with the multiplayer:1. Servers, as a player from SEA, it kinda sucks to always be in the yellow. With that said, I'll let this one go, because I'm old and I don't have the reflexes to be good at FPS multiplayer, even if I had optimal conditions.  There are obviously those rage enducing moments, when you go scope to scope with another sniper, shoot first, but die anyway. Apart from that, barely noticable.2. The maps are nice, quiant. However in the past few CoDs, maps got more condensed, which made sense because CoD multiplayer got more vertical with wall running and hippity hopping. The maps should have returned to the MW2 spaciousness since it's ""boots on the ground"".As for the reviews criticizing the historical accuracy of the multiplayer, it's pretty hilarious. It's Call of Duty, don't get butthurt that you aren't RPGing in multiplayer-mode. With all that said, I like. Very much."

												The game is fun. I enjoy the multiplayer more than i did Bo3's, and the zombies is better than any of the past non treyarch zombies adaptations. The lack of accuracy pains me however. It can be argued that playing COD for historical accuracy is stupid, and it is, however I was hoping this game would be a return to the days of World at War. I keep trying to see this game as the return to cods glory days that i hoped it would be, but it is hard to do when I hear female screams every 5 seconds and the Swastikas are replaced with Iron Crosses, and i see LGBTQRSTV 29 to the power of 6 pride flags as peoples calling cards. Back to the gameplay however, I do enjoy it very much. It is a solid installment to the series, just not a return to the games glory days. I think that everyone whining about it needs to stop riding the bandwagon of hating everything COD does and play the game for themself, and realise that call of duty is a game about shooting people and avoiding being shot. It  is not meant to be anything more than the exact definition of shooter game. This is why I reccomend this game."

												Where to start? First off many have already mentioned the innacurracy of Germans carrying the PPSh 41. In defense of the devs, the SMG in the game is actually what appears to be a variant of the MP28, something that did see service in WWII. What cannot be explained or defended is the use of the SVT-40 by German troops. While it is true that a lot of these rifles were captured by German troops, they found out very quickly what the Russians already knew- these guns were prone to failure and not any good at all (hence the reason the bolt-action Mosin-Nagant was produced in far greater numbers). Many reviewers also comment on the appearance of relex sights in multiplayer. Reflex sights were actually developed back in 1900. The army used a sight developed in 1943 that did see service WWII. Use though was limited as the sights required a lot of amibent light to function.About the actual game mechanics. The quicktime events are downright frustrating as the buttons reuired to do the certain action change. Changing the particular button would be fine except you dont really know what button it wants until you drag your mouse to a certain spot on the screen. Further, if you happened to re-bind the key that it wants, it may be impossible to complete the move as the dialog sayus ""unbound"". This also happened to me when I needed to give the code phrase to Fischer. I could not respond with the code phrase because I re-binded the crouch command to ctrl. Changing the bindings back to default resolved this but that should not be an issue with a AAA game release. The tank mission was absolutely awful. I honestly thought something was wrong with my mouse since I could barely move the turret. And forget about common sense when trying to figure out forward/back/left/right. The tank only takes your  input as suggestions.The game looks outstanding and runs great on my older system (AMD 8350, R9 280X, 16GB RAM, SSD). However this brings me to the biggest issue with the game- load times. When loading a new mission, it goes to a cutscene and starts loading the level. The cutscenes are actually very good, and this being my first play-through I did not want to skip them. Good thing too because there wouldn't be a way to skip. The cutscene ends and the level is STILL loading. After about another 10-15s the level starts. I have not tried multiplayer yet but I've read that the loading times there are just as bad. Again, this is a AAA game title, so this is simply unacceptable. The story itself is average. We've all heard/seen/played the D-Day assault a thousand times by now. What they did do right was the Liberation mission. It was actually really refreshing, but it's too short and the game quickly goes back to the same 'ol CoD experience- run here, kill that guy, grab a sniper rifle and defend that thing...etc.All in all, Call of Duty: WWII is not a bad game. It's also nowhere near as good or groundbreaking as Call of Duty II. Because of the abovementioned issues, I cannot recommend this game. However if gameplay issues are patched (they should be) This game could prove to be quite enjoyable so long as you're willing to forgive historical inaccuracy."

												I wish there was an in between rating that I could put on this game. So I’ll start with the positives.This is a very polished game in my opinion. It has a lot of good mechanics and I feel like the mechanics work well for the game.  Overall it’s very fun and I do enjoy playing it.My main concern is with the connection and latency in multiplayer. I want to preface this by saying I don’t experience this issue with any other game. Rainbow six siege, battlefield 1, PUBG, any other cod game, really any other shooter is fine. In this game I feel like I’m always a second or two behind everyone else. On my screen I can start shooting an enemy and I know I start shooting first, but then one bullet and I’m dead. I feel like it is very unfair and most of the time I don’t die due to my own error which can really dampen the experience.  Something is wrong with the connection and needs to be fixed.Currently I’m going to rate this as a don’t buy, but if the connection is improved then it’s a definite buy!"

												From the times I have played the game, I loved it. The Nazi zombies goes back to its roots and I love it.THE  MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME IS THAT FACT THAT IT WILL NOT LOAD. Single player and Multi player both crash before I even have the chance to play it. If they fix it, I will play the game. But it is not worth the 100$ I paid for the deluxe editionEdit 1: So far I now I have a total of 4 games played on multiplayer. Every time I try to load the game or you know go try to play something other than the major game modes on multiplayer, the game quits on me and displays an error message.Edit 2: After contacting Activision about this major bug and seeing their first update. I noticed... THEY STILL HAVEN'T FIXED THE MAJOR BUG THAT WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO GET PAST MOST OF THE LOADING SCREENS. After this ""cash grab"" of a game I will boycott everything Activision because I am afraid I will get the same worthless product again. Also I requested a refund, which I am totally expecting from Valve, becasue this game is not playable as it stands today 11/6/2017.Edit 3: OMG Steam just refused my refund request because I ""exceded their 2 hour maximum play time. So to all those who are thinking about waisting their money on this game. Know you only have 2 hours to try this game out and found out it is complete sh*t before steam will royally butt f**k you for trying this game. THANKS STEAM YOU'RE THE BESTEdit 4: So now it ""works"" I get to play one game, and then I have to fully restart my computer inorder just to play another game... WTF ActivisionEdit 5: Few days after the new patch they released. So far I feel like I have more confidence getting to the game. But it still crashes worse than NASCAR"

												the only thing good about this game is zombies.multiplayer is the same generic ""spawn die, spawn die"" repetitive crap with absolutely zero teamwork involved. the maps are tiny. pvp is pretty much bumping into people around a corner and whoever can hold down the trigger first wins. campaign was also boring to tears full of cliches. there is absolutely nothing special about this game. this franchise needs to die now. now zombies on the other hand.. that♥♥♥♥♥♥is lit. to bad you only get 1 map to play on and will probably be forced to pay another $20 for when a new one comes out."

												After completing the story and playing the multioplayer for about an hour, I can say that I am enjoying this game. Not only does it run really well but it is also better than the few previous Call of Duty games in my opinion. However, it is still not a good game. The Campaign:Well made and the cutscenes are absolutely gorgeous. I noticed that during some cutscenes my framerate will go from a solid 60 fps down to about 25 to 30 fps. Alot of time was put into the campaign and by far it is my favorite part of the game. That being said it is Call of Duty, no one really spends the $60 on the single player.The Multiplayer:So far I'm mixed on it. Gameplay wise, I feel like the time to kill is way too long, nearly an entire mag of an assault rifle and it finally drops someone. I would play hardcore but there isn't that many people playing it and there is only four game modes. There is also the typical microtransactions, they are pointless and we all hate them but they do not take away from the expirience. You use CoD points to purchase items to unlock different gun variants, which are for cosmetics and they boost your XP gained with that weapon increase by 10%. That being said I like the guns, there is a decent selection and the unlocks for them make it feel like they are getting better the more you play with them.Overall:I can't reccomend this game at the price it is at. I purchased my copy from GMG for 15% off and I still feel like that is too much. It's Call of Duty but no laser weapons and no jetpacks, it's an old feeling Call of Duty with dumb microtransactions. Wait for a heavy sale on the game and pick it up if you want a game for some mindless enjoyment. Other than that just remember that Call of Duty is crawling to a slow death, one year at a time."

												I havent played COD since Black Ops 2. I felt the franchise was getting boring and I assumed WW2 would be different. I was wrong.I honestly think the gameplay has gone backwards and is even more boring now. The COD franchise panicked and tried to compete with Battlefield 1's setting but it hasnt even came close. Im really sad to see this franchise crash and burn because I had so many great memories from Modern Warfare growing up. I guess this is the last COD game I ever buy (now refunded). Such a shame"

												At the end of the day this is just another ploy from activision to make more money. Basically the SP takes about 4 to 5 hours to play through dependant upon if you do all the side objectives etc. The MP yet again has failed my expectations due to them not having dedicated servers whereupon cheating will be rampant amongst the games. At the end of the day it's just a mod from overwatch disgusting to say but it is. Loot boxes? I mean can you be anymore cookie cutter activision? If you want your game to be ACTUALLY successful you have to bring back dedicated servers to let us MOD the game. That's why the old COD's were SO good because the community mods. If that were to ever happen which in this day and age it will not then I would be rating this game 5 out of 5. Yet, since it is not I would recommend people honestly just wait for a price drop to play or torrent the SP portion of the game because Activision yet again has not lived up to the expectations. Hence 3/5.TL;DR Bring back dedicated servers/Let us mod the game/SP torrent that/Wait for price drop."

And yet another yearly Call of Duty game and this time, back to World War 2!TL;DR: I PLAY COD GAMES MAINLY FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND EVEN SO, COD WWII CAMPAIGN IS UNDERWHELMING. MP IS BAD AND ZOMBIE MODE IS THE SAME RECYCLED BS. YOU ARE WARNED!One of the most hated games of late... here's what I think about it:Same old same old but this time, back to WW2, the setting COD games were the strongest IMHO... like the series startup Call of Duty, the expansion and my second favorite COD WW2 game, World at War. I've had mixed feelings with CoD WWII. It still doesn't try to reinvent the franchise, you do feel at home with pretty much everything offered to you. However, the campaign mode is such in a smaller scale and even the missions are so damn short. You do have a few great missions to play from the D-Day to some ""Encouraged"" Stealth based missions. Zombie mode is still present if that is you sort of thing! Naturally, the main selling point of every CoD games is the MultiPlayer. From the closed beta that I had played before the game launch, not much has changed. So if you did played it, don't expect wonders... oh and the ""watch your friend/foe"" open the damn infamous loot crates/boxes is quite a lowblow from the publisher stand point.I had some technical difficulties at first with WWII. Had to Alt+Tab a few times until the start screen goes black to ""normal"". Except that, the game is in working order... no crashes or gamebreaking bugs. While I haven't experienced anything really nasty, I did had a few frame drops and slowdowns at areas in the story mode campaign. Nonetheless, the game works as it is advertised.CampaignFrom start till the end, the campaign is pretty much average. The singleplayer campaign isn't really about WWII anyway, it's about how friendship between adult men requires both great sacrifice and a great aim. Granted I play the COD games for the campaign mainly (only) and I had mixed feelings with the campaign. It follows you and your squad buddies in the WWII campaign. You start from the D-Day Omaha Beach. It is a nice ""comeback"" there from the good old Medal of Honor 2001 except with modern visuals. Then you continue the WWII campaign lead by Sergent ""I'M P I S S E D  AT YOU ALL JUST BECAUSE"", voice acted and modeled after Josh Duhamel. Annoying character and I wanted to just kill him right up!The missions themselves are quite short for a COD game. Shorter than many I played before. No optional side missions like what Infinite Warfare offered and totally linear this time. You have like three 'heavily focused' stealth missions so it is a change of pace! The gameplay (on foot) is very similar to your average WW2 themed game. You have ONE mission set in a fighter plane and a few short jeep driving missions. There is one tank mission as well. Fun but short mission! The campaign is challenging and offer at least a good 7 hours of playtime. If you only seek for a campaign based game, play Wolfenstein 2 instead!Zombie ModeSame thing that you are accustomed to from past zombie modes. Biggest difference here is the inclusion of the loot crate system... yeah, that thing! You still have a progression system like in before. Gone is the theme park setting from Infinite Warfare, this zombie mode is much better! The game mode is pretty fun but truly more rewarding when played with players and better with friends! However, you can have more fun by just playing Killing Floor 2 instead!MultiPlayerI gave this a shot for an hour... and knowing the MP is the main selling point of every COD games, I wasn't much impressed by it. Maps are WAY WAY TOO SMALL! There seems to be many exploits and cheaters in every games there is. As of now, if you are really looking to play this game MP, you may give it a shot before the Season Pass maps releases since after that, you'll be ""forced"" to get those maps in order to keep playing with players. There is that nasty loot crate/box system that enables to get things faster. Not much a paywall like the upcoming Star Wars Battlefront 2 but quite unnecessary anyway! With this saturated FPS market in late 2017 that seems to force that loot box system, I wouldn't get this COD game for the MP only.  As for MP, either play Red Orchestra 2 / Vietnam OR keep playing last year's FPS games. They can do the job rather good!PROS:+Visually impressive for a CoD game!+Smaller scale story mode compared to previous CoD games. Feels very ""Band of Brothers"" -sy! +No crashes, bugs on my rig. Game just works as it should be from launch day! +Great voice acting from known actors+Music is fine and fitting.+Gameplay is the same thing (mostly) as previous COD games. The biggest change now is the removal of health regeneration. YES AT LAST!!! [CAMPAIGN MODE ONLY] It never regenerates, only replenished by health packs scattered around the level or thrown to you by a squadmate. Same goes with ammo, grenades, mortar strikes and spotting enemies.+The teamates A.I. is usually good. They are reliable this time and aren't pointless fodder like older CoD games.+Stealth missions are a welcome change of pace and very well done!+HeadQuarters area in the MultiPlayer is where you can customize your character. It is a nice hub to see other players and such. You can play old Atari games too there!+""Three games in One"" (Campaign/ZombieMode/MultiPlayer) CONS:-Loot crate/box/'wateva you wanna call it' is totally unnecessary. Not much of a pay-to-win at least but even so, very annoying.-Story is a hit and miss at times. Good at times but very historically inaccurate. D-Day Germans using Russian weapons.-Censorship of historical material such as the SS uniforms like the arm bands were wiped of the Nazi Party emblem and replaced.-Campaign missions are very very short. Both in MP and SP, the maps are too small!-The ending wraps up as one of the quieter COD campaign ever. ""Doesn't end"" with a 'bang!' meaning it is over fairly quickly.-Multiplayer is where the game is known for. Alas, no dedicated servers, no anti-cheat system brings this game down a lot!-Expensive Season Pass that is ""almost required"" to be bought if you see yourself playing the MP a lot!RECOMMENDATION:I DO NOT RECOMMEND COD WWII FOR ANY GAME MODE AT FULL PRICE. If 30$ cheaper is fine by you then yes I recommend it.Dull and shallow campaign mode that can be finished under 8 hours is where this CoD sit's at. Campaign feels a lot like a Brother in Arms episode (long episodes) and gives you an underwhelming ending. Last year's Infinite Warfare was such a hated CoD game but its campaign mode was A LOT BETTER than this WWII!Buying this game at full price for the campaign only mode seems excessive and I can understand that. However, whenever you have the time and money, give this game a shot once it gets into a Steam Sale. That is up to you! Thanks to GreenManGaming, I have saved a good 30$!"

												Fantastic F**k up as usual, haven't bought a call of duty for years because they've been absolute trash. Thought this one actually looks good. I played the beta, which was good for the first day. The next two days after that it was riddled with hackers. But I went against my better judgement and bought the game a week ago. I haven't been able to play the zombies or the online at all. I have tried all the possible solutions that I have spent hours scouring the internet for, nothing has worked. All I get is - Error Code: 69756 -,-,C,D,E,F,G,-,-,-,-,-,M,-,-,-Q,. I have lots of games and never have any issue playing online with any of them, yet all the solutions seem to aim at that it is somehow mine, or my computers fault. Here's an idea though... Fix you're F*****g game that I payed 45gbp for and can't play. If I cannot play it still within the next week I will be getting a refund, it's as simple as that."

There were times that I experienced low ping but the rubberbanding is so frustrating :(.The Campaign is good the storyline, but its too short. I was expecting it to be more longer.Well for me unless they do something about the servers/p2p matching etc. I'll give a positive review. but for now I can give it a negative review :(I would want to refund but I played it more than 2hours so I guess I'll have to keep it and see if there will be any improvments with the servers."

												Hi everybody!I rate the singleplayer only, because I don't care about multiplayer. This is the first COD I play since Call of Duty: World at War, as I do not like modern war.I finished the campaign of this great game a few minutes ago. It took me about 15 hours, repeating some parts to get all the collectibles... So it is the right time to write a review.Because of all these negative reviews it is more important to me, to tell another story.Now I will give some details, trying not to spoil too much...The campaign:The campaign is one of the greatest I've ever played. It is stage-managed like a big American Hollywood Blockbuster. Like it or not. A mixture between glorification and drama. There are very loud an quick moments and there are slow and quiet moments. In my opinion it is a great mixture.This game will give you more impressions than 10 movies, because in game development there are no real limits. I will not give any example from the game because you should experience that on your own. But a few times I sat in front of my monitor slack-jawed...The story itself is about four comrades fighting the western front from D-Day to the Rhine-crossing. Not best, but really not bad.Some people complain about completing the campaign in about 6 hours. Sorry, guys, something has gone wrong for you. Running through the game, blinders on, gunning down everything and skipping the great videos?! Not the way to play this game. Perhaps the wrong kind of game for you. Sorry.The graphics:With all details max, this game look really great. Best ever seen in a WW2 SINGLEPLAYER. Remember, there may be better engines and textures out there, but not in a WW2 singleplayer game.Especially the videos are great and near to real movie scenes.The sound:Biggest challenge in this game is the sound. The german (I've played it in german) synchronization is complete and good. Only the volume of single audio sources is fluctuating. Sometimes you can not hear explosions nearby or a speaking comrade.Maybe they will fix this in a patch.The system:i5-6600K OC450016GB RAMGTX 1080 8GB OC2000newest driverall details max1080p full details with constant 60fps (cut to 60)No single crash; on rare occasions stuttering for a second (extreme scripted events/explosions)Only sometimes the games starts in the background, so I have to tab out, tab back in and maximise to fullscreen again. No problem.The censorship:Many (german) player complain about the censorship in the german version (missing german symbolics). Me too. What a shame.BUT: It is german right, do not hold the publisher responsible for that! They had no choice.Good news: The censorship does not ruin the game. In only a handful of scenes you stare directly onto some banners. Really rar. And the emblems on the helmets of the enemy... If you can see them, you are far too close! ;-)So, conclusion:If you are a singleplayer, like/love WW2 settings with good story and a mixture between action and stealth (less stealth): BUY THIS! (and write a review... ;-))Fish76"

Not much of a pay-to-win at least but even so, very annoying.-Story is a hit and miss at times. Good at times but very historically inaccurate. D-Day Germans using Russian weapons.-Censorship of historical material such as the SS uniforms like the arm bands were wiped of the Nazi Party emblem and replaced.-Campaign missions are very very short. Both in MP and SP, the maps are too small!-The ending wraps up as one of the quieter COD campaign ever. ""Doesn't end"" with a 'bang!' meaning it is over fairly quickly.-Multiplayer is where the game is known for. Alas, no dedicated servers, no anti-cheat system brings this game down a lot!-Expensive Season Pass that is ""almost required"" to be bought if you see yourself playing the MP a lot!RECOMMENDATION:I DO NOT RECOMMEND COD WWII FOR ANY GAME MODE AT FULL PRICE. If 30$ cheaper is fine by you then yes I recommend it.Dull and shallow campaign mode that can be finished under 8 hours is where this CoD sit's at. Campaign feels a lot like a Brother in Arms episode (long episodes) and gives you an underwhelming ending. Last year's Infinite Warfare was such a hated CoD game but its campaign mode was A LOT BETTER than this WWII!Buying this game at full price for the campaign only mode seems excessive and I can understand that. However, whenever you have the time and money, give this game a shot once it gets into a Steam Sale. That is up to you! Thanks to GreenManGaming, I have saved a good 30$!"

												Fantastic F**k up as usual, haven't bought a call of duty for years because they've been absolute trash. Thought this one actually looks good. I played the beta, which was good for the first day. The next two days after that it was riddled with hackers. But I went against my better judgement and bought the game a week ago. I haven't been able to play the zombies or the online at all. I have tried all the possible solutions that I have spent hours scouring the internet for, nothing has worked. All I get is - Error Code: 69756 -,-,C,D,E,F,G,-,-,-,-,-,M,-,-,-Q,. I have lots of games and never have any issue playing online with any of them, yet all the solutions seem to aim at that it is somehow mine, or my computers fault. Here's an idea though...

 Call of Duty: World War 2 Review (TLDR BELOW) Story      The story of this game follows a platoon in the 1st Infantry Division, made up of a collection of veterans and rookies. In terms of depth, is was rather good, but missed so many opportunities to truly develop the characters. But in terms of a Call of Duty Singleplayer story, it is rather good. Gameplay      The gameplay is solid, nothing to write home about but not terrible either. Multiplayer seems a tad neutered in terms of weapon variety and makes it feel... Empty in a way you can't quiet pin down. But not everything about the multiplayer is like that, it is still the same, high octane, gung-ho, action packed multiplayer we all fell in love with so long ago. Sounds are beefy and gore adds a nice level of impact to the combat. Controversy      Being a game published by Activision, that alone is cotroversy enough, though this time around they seem to have actually taken feedback from gamers. The loot crates no longer drop new weapons and better versions of already existing ones. Simply cosmetics and possibly attachments, but I have yet to see that. Another issue I see getting reported is how the game runs on Nvidia 1000 series GPUs, but being a 980ti user, I cannot investigate that myself, though I have an idea it may have something to do with the game ready driver provided by Nvidia as some 900 series users are reporting bad frames as well. There also appears to be an issue with crashing on start, but not much more information is provided by those reporting it. Graphics      Beautiful. I mean for a modern game, this is absoulutely gorgeous, the environments have so much depth, and so much polish, it kinda almost makes you forget you are playing a Call of Duty game. Runs good too, the game ran at a steady 60 FPS on my 980ti in both single and multiplayer. There were times where my card ran a little hot and the fan had to kick up in speed to help the water cooler. But this is in a place where heaters run essentially 24/7 to keep the house ""by the fireplace"" levels of warm.Oh and there is an FoV Slider that works for both SP and MP!!! TLDR      CoD:WW2 is a step in the right direction for the series, Activision rolled back the way Loot Crates work by making them only drop cosmetic items. The gameplay is solid, the graphics are beautiful, the story is interesting for those of you who mostly pick up these games for the singleplayer, and despite some issues with crashing and poor preformance, nothing a little time and bug fixing can't rally together. Rating 🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑"

												I never had any major issue with it that would ruin my enjoyable gameplay experience with this game as It's very optimized as it's going to get for this current generation of 64 bit of cod engines.  I get actually the same FPS as always with Infinite Warfare and Black Ops 3 but the most major thing I like about this game. There is no wall runs, no bs double jumping and flying to the point I have to move my head clear up to shoot someone up from the damn sky all the dang time. Hated it so damn much! Last time I remember having such multi-kills from day 1 would be MW2. I barely able to pull a multi on black ops 2, 3, AW, Ghosts, MWR (HA) etc. Also, yay for no more annoying preloading shaders that did absolutely nothing to optimized and I just hit Esc all the time to move on as MWR engine is too trash to optimized. I can party up my friends without any issues like I have with MWR, IW sometimes Black Ops 2 & 3. I haven't played the story mode yet but I hear good things about it and looking forward to diving right in sometime this winter and play.  also the original LEAN SUPPORT!! freaking sweet. The advanced options menu was VERY GOOD on detail/preview images on what to turn on or off to make your game look less like lego blocks with PS2 graphics when you first run. EW indeed.Now time for a rant/roast but I do recommend this game as it's fun once you get the hang of your setup and movement and ignore the minor bugs annoying bs like fov and UI but of course, I gotta roast Activision since well *elderly man MW2 commercial voice* everyone is doing it.They owe us a major fix for MWR & AW and delaying mod tools so much on black ops 3 after the player base pretty much die off or nobody simply enjoys ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unranked online only dedicated servers. As I say this just minor things that don't affect my gameplay of this cool game but needs patches and would be the greatest classic COD come back. The UI: This piece of garbage reminds me so much of another piece of garbage that Battlefield games that turn me away as I couldn't get the damn thing figure out the way I wanted or try joining with a friend. Glad you have a basic tutorial on that during beta or I would of uninstall in 2 mins in it. You also rename so much crap it makes people hard to find what they looking for. Yeah, that's a nice suit I got out of the *cough*stage 3 cancer*cough* supply drops but how do I equip my suit? WHERE?!?!?! Do have to earn it maybe? If so that's Ducking ridiculous guys to get awarded for something I can't use yet. speaking of rewards why my and everyone ranks, playercards, have this animated sledgehammer logo spinning around all the dang time? Seems to only happen with IW & SHG engines. Stop breaking demonware loading you noobs. Also why do we have to Press stupid Q to map vote? Can we just hit the text of the map name and just go with that? I don't need previews of the maps anyway once I remember all their names.The FOV: Why does my gun still feel like it's really 65 but outside of that it's all 90-95? Whoever thought this idea needs go back to the cancer console development team since he likes his gun to be zoom up his ducking face taking 45% of the screen. I have also discovered a bug that resets 65 everytime. Maybe due being borderless window mode? Also, have this annoying issue with Advanced Warfare.  So lol nothing changed for the past 3 years ayy? still keeping that 65 fov while developing to realized the ducking thing is broken. Just stop PC development altogether if you going to keep that crap up.Local Play? Why this feature exists when it doesn't let you join while you offline? Oh, that's right. This is your new sugar daddy...Well, that's my end of 3 minor issues I dislike. I hope all 3 of them gets patched up the correct way but I won't hold my breath. I might die from that. You think a multi-billion dollar company would afford random pcs to do stability test and longer beta tests to be more alert of bugs but no they in bed with Sony & Microsoft consoles so much as it's the most secure systems ever and they always get♥♥♥♥♥♥first and stable♥♥♥♥♥♥before we do. Screw the creators that love making mods and custom maps, hosters that love hosting their own servers and right Activision? If it wasn't for PC community. Your games are nothing like they are today. You owe us the stability of all games and map packs first for a change. Not consoles!Overall this game still has hopes. Don't let my rant and raving change your mind about this game. Don't let the reviews change your mind either. It's all a mixture of good and bad. Just try it and see if you like it and if you don't...refund before you go over 50 hours. Hope my review makes you laugh and agreed that the PC community always going to shafted no matter what they say or do or promise. What I don't agree is all the negative this game deserve already from haters which is normal every year a new call of duty comes out. Most of them are either still on the beating a dead cow called windows 7 for poor♥♥♥♥♥optimization or probably using nvidiadrivers that's probably 4 years old or they just like to troll you or they all joining the bandwagon of ""FK this trash game that I haven't played & mess with my settings"". lol! You all forgetting one thing.... Activision doesn't care about PC! No matter how many negative reviews escalated they got a new sugar daddy this year and you just going to play ALL year and you still going to B!TCH because that's what you do. biotch! I rest my case."

												Lots of people who recommend this game are either trolls or bandwagoner of hate. This game is not as good as the old cod like bo1 or mw2, but it's an improvement and way better than all the futuristic cod. It's also fun af if you have friends to play withStory Mode: It's really amazing. It took me 6 hours to beat it if you take your time and the characters  are good that you feel how they feel in this era. I think Cod campaign are always great and this is one may not be the best, but this one is good as well if you enjoy michael bay action movies and linear games.Multiplayer:At first, i hated it but that's because I suck at the game and I turn on vsync by accident which make my mouse choppy. So make sure to turn that shiz off. Multiplayer is fun and the maps are great. The only map i have is the canon one imho. Overall this is an improvement from advanced warfare and its back on boots on the ground. Also the gun sounds great.Also the headquarters mode in this game is amazing and it's just like destiny if you into that. Supply drop is okay and good for now and hope they keep it cosmetic. Also, this game has tons of customization.Zombie:Zombie is amazing here. Sledgehammer did a good job adapting to the zombie formula and improve on it. Also it's tons of fun and recommend getting this game if you love zombies. Probably my only con is there is only one map.Graphic:The trolls who said this game looks trash are blind because this game is beautiful than any other COD. I have a gtx 1060 3gb model and it runs over 100 fps consitently on ultra settings.This game is also well optimized and I have no performance issues at all.Try out the game since steam has a refund policy and if you don't like it, then refund it. It's well worth my 60 bucks :)"

												Darn, I can't recommend this game. I actually love it. It's very fun to pop on some headphones and rock out to music while running around the maps like I did 15 years ago when I last played PC games.The issue I am having is that the community is dead already and the game has barely been out for a month. I like Carentan 24/7 but never play it because I can't get in a game. I like Domination and Hardpoint but good luck getting 12 people in a game to play it.  TDM is really boring to me but that's where most of the people play.  Sadly, the game modes that I love just don't have the multiplayer base that is required.I see the same names all the time in Carentan which means that very few of us are playing.  I have not even started the single player campaign and probably never will.  I don't care at all about the story or historical accuracy.  Last time I checked there wasn't a breakout of Zombies attacking WW2 soldiers so I'm not all about ""keeping it real"".I'm a pretty lousy player but I really like this game.  I guess there will be an influx of players after Christmas and again when the first DLC maps are released but what a pain to wait that long to just get in a few games.Oh well, TDM it is."

												I'm attempting to go through the Campaign right now, so I can't comment fully on this portion of the game.  For what it's worth it seems interesting enough, if a bit cliche'.  I do find myself bored with it at times and think I should really just play Wolfenstein to get my SP WW2-ish fix.On to the multiplayer.  This is where they had a  chance to shine and ultimately failed.  I was a big COD player back all the way up to Black Ops 3 and they lost me at Advanced Warfare, so I was greedily looking forward to the franchise bring the boots to the ground WW2 old school gun game back to the PC!  The concept was good, but execution is so flawed.The good:  WW2 environment, gone are all the jet packs and a good concentration on old school fps gaming.  The weapons are somewhat satisfying to use, and game modes like Kill Confirmed, War and Domination still were conceptually good.  HQ concept is interesting.  Reward/Orders/Contracts system can make grinding a bit more tolerable.The bad:  This is where the game gets it's thumb's down.So many broken features.  Things in HQ that aren't available but visible.  Terrible hit reg.  Lag.  And while they state they have dedicated servers, it's still using matchmaking that is questionable at best.  The guns, while some are satisfying, are overall imbalanced.  Snipers and shotguns needing a nerf, while the flinch in the game is utterly broken.  I hear they are trying to fix this, but they haven't fixed global flinch yet, but still nerfed the Primed basic training (which is supposed to reduce flinch).  Snipers are beyond annoying in this game.The maps are insufferably small and far too few of them for launch.  It's like playing inside a toaster they're so small.  Carentan, the season-pass only map is on a stupid rotation of just 24/7 Carentan where you have to deal with playing game modes you don't want to.  So no, want Carentan on the regular rotation of maps if you're a Domination player?  Sorry, no can do. All of this *might* be forgivable if cheating wasn't rampant in this game, and therein lies the base of the main problem with this game.  Sledgehammer games were well aware of paid and unpaid hacks circulating during the beta and made a pledge to the PC community that they would rectify this by including an in-game dedicated anti-cheat by official game launch time.  (think Punkbuster, TAC or Fairfight). To this date, they have NOT done this.  There is nothing.  VAC is steam based and doesn't help at all.  On top of that, cheaters have found ways around VAC bans by using family sharing.  There have been no successful bans, no anti-cheat installed, and really what is the point in legitimately trying to grind to high prestige levels when you come across cheaters (yes, i've watched live streamed cheats.....they're bold now) that literally can have you dead at spawn, from across the map, through walls.  INSTANTLY.This is what kills the game and forces me to not recommend it at all.Put in a dedicated anti-cheat, dedicated rentable servers so we can police ourselves and not deal with matchmaking and perhaps we have a whole different thing.  Maybe worth a thumbs up.  But until these blatant issues are corrected, this game is NOT worth your time and money in its' current state.  And an absolute NO for anyone considering the Season Pass or DLC content.If they fix these things, i'll revise my review appropriately.As of now, this is my last Call of Duty title I will ever purchase."

I do really like the creativity of the uniform, but please do it for the Axis power too. Also have some uniform from different country too. Example we have Russian and Netherland uniform for the allies, why not have some japanese uniform or italian. This is all I wish for christmas.                                                                                                   From ImperialRotalGamerI also recommend this game to anyone who love world war 2 and competitive gaming."

												The campaign and zombies are actually quite good so I don't have much to say about those, However the multiplayer is what everybody plays a COD game for (Story games in 2017 waduhek?).Pros:+ Voice chat is included so I can keep track of who slept with my mother.+ Voice Comms are perfect for listening to people telling me to hang myself.+ In game text chat so people can tell me that I'm a hard scoping newb.+ Swastikas created using the emblem creator.+ Paying for extra maps so that the devs can wipe their arses with my buckaroos.Cons: - Sledgehammer didn't include the rope for hanging myself that I've been told to do.- Squeakers think they got a shot with my mum.- Few friends and myself gave ourselves the tag [VAPE] its not a clan, its a lifestyle.Obviously this is subject to change as I experience more in the greatest game released in 2017 I only hope that we get more DLC that I'm going to have to pay for because developers just want them buckaroos.I also really liked the part where everybody abandons guns and just runs around with shovels totally accurate to how I pictured WW2 going down. I can just imagine Hitler sat in his bunker getting ready to shoot himself when he spies the trench shovel in the corner of the room so he can just off himself with that instead.Overall I would give this game 11/10 Hitlerstaches, It would have been 12 but the devs forgot to ship the rope."

												Not impressed with the campaign (weapons being used by the wrong armies - i'm fairly sure someone called them out on this months ago after watching the trailer - they clearly don't care, occasional frustrating bugs, unskippable cut-scenes). The cut-scenes did look good, but they are just a video with decent actors that I ended up browsing imgur on my phone during. The multiplayer has been crap since MW2 on PC, I won't be touching it. The engine is smooth and looks good, but it isn't revolutionising anything (I think this sums up all Call of Duty games). I feel bad that by buying this, Activision will continue to pump games like this out.I tested the game on an old PC with an Nvidia GTX 670, forced all settings into Ultra despite the VRAM warnings and the game decided to ignore the graphics config after it was set. Even after restarting the game and double checking that everything was in Ultra the game seems to just ignore the graphics settings on old hardware. The game ran smooth on the old hardware, but this is because the game engine decided to do it's own thing (it looked shocking, even though everything was set to Ultra)."

												As much as I want to like this game and give it raving reviews, i can not. I can't believe that SH hasn't taken the time to put out a patch to fix the network issues. Attempting to play online with friends is absolutely horrible at best. Graphics are mediocre, and it's the same old Hacker/Cheater fueled gameplay it has been in the past. The SP campaign is just ""okay"", i've gotten almost half way through, but it sure as heck doesn't give anything to make me want to jump back in and play. SledgeRammer needs to do something, but we all know that they won't... heck, they taken our money again for yet another POS CoD game. It sucks, because I had been a HUGE fan since the early stages up until the games after Black Ops II or so. All they have tried to do is put lipstick on a pig... which as we know still looks and plays like crap. I would not waste your hard earned money or  parent's money on this... you won't be happy. Sorry, but it is terrible, and i was so looking forward to a good WWII Title. This is just embarrasing."

												This is the first COD game I actually enjoy since BO2 but sadly I can't recommend it. First there are a lot of bugs, for example me and my friend have both experienced a bug where the resolution would get set to 4k without our knowledge and the game would run very poorly because of it. Another issue with this game is the fact that even when i turn settings down i still get performance drops at least a few times every match (I have a i7-6700k and a GTX 1080 so this shouldn't really be an issue). The next issue I have with the game is the servers, now I appreciate that they have dedicated servers but when the servers seem to work worse than the P2P connection its a problem. Another problem is a lot of the weapons don't feel very balanced, at least in my experience there is a clearly defined meta and I only ever see about 5 guns being used and not much else. The last issue with the game is the amount of cheaters in the game, I ran into a cheater on the 25th, another on the 29th, and two more in back to back matches on the 30th, so the problem appears to be getting worse. (also just to be clear I have almost 23 hours on multiplayer and almost 4 on campaign)"

												After 50 hours of multiplayer and 10 hours of the singleplayer campaign i've came out with this review. Ill start with the campaing.The campaign: The campaign is mediocre not really good but not bad. Basically its run somewhere cutscene and repeating. The squad members are cool but when nazis shoot at you, you're squad mates don't cover you, they are there only for the supplies. One level i really enjoyed (small spolier) was the France one. The game is basically modern Cod or should i say Scripts of duty. And some parts of the game are so scripted its kinda funny. The mementos (Basically some things you can collect during the game) aren't even worth pointing out cause they're not important to the story and really minor, i didn't bothered to collect them during my time. The game is only rushing to the objective and the Germans retreat even though they had the advantage. The main villian of the story is not really intimidating and the main protagonist is pretty good and along the journey you feel the feels that he has. As i said the campaign is mediocre but i've really enjoyed the campaing. Mainly the France mission, that was pretty amazing for me.The multiplayer: Basically Cod multiplayer. What can i say. Maps are small and the gameplay is fast, but thats a good thing for some players. I've bought this game to have fun and it delivers it. Some say they got bored of the multiplayer pretty fast but this isn't for me. i'm rank 41 in time of writting this review and still satisfies me. As you might have guessed the player base is full of toxic players calling you ""Noob"" for using the shotgun or ""Noob team"" when they lose even ""Hacker"" when someone is a better player than him. Yes they are hackers but i've seen only one during my time. The gamemodes are nothing new you got the standart gamemodes like Team deathmatch, capture the flag, free for all, demolition and so on. The war mode is apparently rippof of some gamemode in battlefield 1 but i'm too lazy to look up what it is and i don't play Battlefield, but none the less still fun gamemode. The division you'd figure out but personally mine's favourite is the airbone. You have the normal mode or the hardcore modes, also ranked play. During some times the game includes special events like winter seige that just ended (Basically a christmas/winter event).Nazi zombies: The zombies mode is pretty fun you will fight hordes of nazi zombies and have to complete objectives to reach the end. Its a horde mode that obviously will get more difficult and you go on. You might wanna look at youtube for some of it. The story of it is that an Austrian engineer Marie Fischer is looking for her brother in some town where nazis dug up some artifacts and she hires four people: Jefferson Pots, Drostan Hynd and Olivia Durant. Mine personal favourite is Drostan because he's scottish and i love Scottis people and their accent and he's voiced by David Tennant the guy who played Doctor who. You can play alone or some random people that want to complete the map or some idiots that sit in a corner killing zombies and don't group up, thats why i prefer going alone. I haven't completed the standart map The final reich. It is scary for the first time but when you play it more and more you know what is going to happen.The game has problems mainly in the multiplayer servers but if activision didn't partner with Sledgehammer studios the game would be much worse. In my opinion i think that Sledgehammer will make the game alive for a few years. But for me its worth spending you're time and playing this game.To some people that read my whole review thank you for making my wasted time worth and found this review helpful. Obviously you can look at a review from a proffesional like AngryJoe that made it better than me but i've already written mine."

												Alright so far i've had this game for a few months its a pretty good game there are some good things but the bad out ways the good the following is y i dont like it that much! Hope u agree!-To many hacks and hackers-So expensive for a game thats very similar to CSGO-No historical acruaccy-added woman characters in a non woman war(Exeption There were some woman who fought as nurses so dont get but hurt and and resistantce)Good things!-HQ-acurate guns-War mod-Great campaignWould i reccomend no but it really depends on the type of gamer u are and i expect realism when i buy a WW2 game well at least some REALISM Aspects thank u for reading this review to the end Hope u enjoy ur desition on weather or not to get the game"

												Reading the reviews, most of them are about the historical inaccuracies. Although, I only realized that after reading the reviews. Unless you actually look for the problems, then you will find them.Experience: I completely recommend this game for those who are looking for a refresher for the old call of duty. The very first level of the campaign brought back nostalgia of Medal of Honor: Frontline. While running across the beach, it felt like I was playing the starting scene of Saving Private Ryan. Difficulty: I will admit, I have played a lot of COD on the hardest difficulty, and this on normal is still a challenge. Especially with the tank fighting. But I personally enjoy a new change of pace.Story: People say that the characters are very forgetable, but compared to other cods, this has really been a step up. They fight along side you, but give you usables. Unlike past games, where they run 10 feet behind, they run next to you, and if you need it, they Bioshock: Infinite throw usables to you, which is something I really enjoy.Overall as a game: 7/10Overall as a COD game: 9/10Story: 7/10"

												The one shot sniper and terrible hit detection are what ruined the experience for me. Seriously, WTF?! Can you imagine if in Halo you only needed to hit the target once (body shot)  with the sniper to get a kill? Who's great idea was that?! Such a waste! I vow that this will be the last time I get bated to buy a CoD. Campaign was short, unsurprisingly, and the gameplay is just the same old same old. I had left the franchise for a bit and got caught up in the hype, however, I've learned my lesson. I will never pay another dime, nickel or penny! I hope this franchise burns to the ground after this game!"

												Been playing Call Of Duty games since original from 2003.Short Singleplayer rating:This game has pretty decent singleplayer experience, far better than the last CoD I played (Ghosts). I enjoyed the singleplayer campaing it was fun and had some great moments. Would rate it 8/10Now for the multiplayer:This game comes very close, or almoust is as much of fun as CoD4 was back in the days. I really like the HQ feature and WAR-mode is a great improvement and really fun gamemode that reguires teamwork (and smokes).Hackers and random server crashings are the only things that are ruining MP experience, but I bet/hope they will do something about them. Ranked mode is not yeat enabled, but I hope it will become avaiable soon, same as the emblem crafting that console players have (heard emblems are coming this december?)At this time I would rate multiplayer 7/10, but when hackers are gone and servers working I will raise the number to 8.5/10."

												I am not generally a COD guy, more like a  Battlefield fan , but man is this game hot. What can I say, this is simply the best Call of Duty game in the franchise, To be honest, I am even starting to like it more than my all-time favourite BF1. Like reviewers mention everywhere, what you are getting here is 'boots on the ground' gameplay, meaning the real deal, no jetpacks, no crazy drones flyin' everywhere, just you, a gun, one grenade and 11 other players ready to rumble in the WW2-inspired arena."

												Call Of Duty WWIIAt first i didn't know what to expect from this game. I certainly didn't expect the game to be what it is. I knew that this game was meant to try and capture a small pace of the many story's from WWII.Its Sum thing else i have never had a story that packs this much of a punch.[Yes its not the longest campaign ever but it might be one of the greatest] The story of friendship.At the end of the day its Call Of Duty so you ether love it or you hate it, I just want to say that story wise this is up there with MW2 [in my opinion] now you might understandably disagree with me but you cant dine that that have done a good job.Yes there is some historical inaccuracy but it is a Call Of Duty game.So would i recommend this game ?Yes in a hart beat, The story is emotion filled with strong cut scenes and most of all a memorable story line.The Graphics are beautiful  and the game runs very smooth well over 60+fps at all times.I would also say that the AI are not utterly useless, E.G. they can and do take out the Enemy and offer support.The multiplayer is a grate experience to play alone with random people, it gets better when you have a party of friends.Weapon balance on multiplayer very good although so maps do lend themselves to a certain type of gun.Good things. [campaign]For a Call Of Duty campaign Its Good, really good. Story is soled and easy to follow.you can do more than walk and shoot, E.G. you can drive a Jeep and shoot waist in a hi-speed chase, engage in dog fights and tank battles.character development is outstandingly good.the lip sink is on point and the voice acting is done to a very hi standard.character models and hotboxes are grate.Cars, Tanks and planes  all look the part.cars handle very well.Down sides. [campaign] [spoilers only apply to 2 levels in the campaign] Plane controls are really un-natural and [this is a Spoiler]  makes the hold dog fighting part of the game stupidly hard as as you may as well be flying jelly around the sky, plane  is unresponsive and when it does respond it is slow. also there is no sense of speed at all. a dog fight is all about speed and movement of witch this game has captured nun of clunky.The Tanks go from op to potato real fast. [spoiler again]  1st Tank Battles in campaign are torturous, tank turret moves so slow. I had to up my DPI just to make the thing move a bit faster, bearing in mined that the AI tanks move like a hyper 5yo this can become not funny very fast  Tank and Plane controls are bad but no unbearable Good things. [multiplayer]Its Call Of duty but what a Call Of Duty should be.No jet packs.No wall running.No special ability. Hard scoping isn't a sin. [its PC people are old enough no to cry over it] Soled 60+fps on all maps and game modes.character models and hotboxes are grate.You can use a tank.There are lots of game modes. Down sides.[multiplayer]Its Call Of Duty so you get 12yo kids that think they are FAZE.Campers, spawn campers.The normal BS you get online.The Odd cheater [yes people have cheats for this game already]The tanks on campaign are op, tanks on multiplayer don't really live up to the expectation.Some of the guns are a bit much E.G. the flame throwing shot gun < yes this is a thing."

												With new ways to prestige, interesting multiplayer levels, more gameplay(especially core mode), this Call of Duty has refreshed the series in my eyes. Nazi Zombies has now become a seperate entity that plays like a zombie horror film. What a fantastic way to set the stage for zombies mode. And, don't get me started on the campaign. Adreniline rush throught, especially on hardcore difficulty, and the visuals were stunning. War mode was a nice addition to the gameplay lineup. Very interesting to play story style missions with human players as the enemies, or to play from the enemies perspective. My only complaint is that there is no true co-op campaign. That was a big bummer to me and my friends who always played the co-op campaign together.Overall, i would recommend this game for anyone like me who is a long time CoD vet."

												A truely refreshing expirence. after having a bunch of jetpack wallrunning future cods, its nice to see a call of duty back at its roots, with fun fast paced gameplay. im actually suprised at the negitivity to the game. as for multiplayer, i think its awesome. especially the war gamemode. there are a few op guns, and glithes but its the first week of the game so im not giving it too much♥♥♥♥♥♥ as for zombies i will say i enjoy more ""spawn and survive"" type maps like town from black ops 2, but the easter eggs are cool, and there is a casual mode that shows you how to solve the zombies puzzles which is nice. and the campaign is awesome. more charecter development than any of the past 3 cods. one HUGE gripe about it is the second to last mission where you drive a tank though. it is IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE THE TANK. no matter how high the sensitivity of your mouse is, the cannon just barely slides along to the point where i cant even beat it at recruit dfficulty. absolutely horrible. i cant finish the campaign because of it. hope it gets fixed. other than that, glad i purchased this gaame. i see many mor hours of fun to be had.

												=================================THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE SINGLE PLAYER=================================Before I begin, I have to say that I am a big fan of WW2 era games over WW1, Vietnam, Modren, etc. So I was waiting for this game for 9 years! Now, is the game good or bad? I would say, a mix of both.Let me talk about the bad things I felt from this game first:-Characters are just awful: (Main Character) keeps crying about wanting to make his brother proud and be a hero. (Your Best Friend) is someone is shoved down your throat, forcing you to like him. Why? Because he's a Jew (Yes this game is another holocaust throat shoving) (2 other guys) who are your friends that serve no purpose. (2 leaders) who keeps fighting about what is right or wrong. Is it the mission or the man next to you? Those last 2 are the most interesting of all the characters in this game. Everyone else is very lame.-Bad Ending. I am not expecting some dramatic ending but the game felt rushed. Like while playing the mission before the last, I wasn't feeling like ""oh next mission is the last because everything is becoming epic!"" instead, final missions are just like any other mission and then BAM game ended....Now the good things:-Game feels real. I played on Veteran (Which I recommend). It wasn't super hard but it made me feel in the middle of WW2. I enjoyed every moment of it.-Graphics are breath-taking. From the dirt and mud on the ground, to the smoke filled skys.-Facial-Animations are amazing. Including good voice-acting.-Gameplay is solid. A bit weird on vehicle scenes.-Good performance on max settings.It was hard for me to decide of this is a thumbs up or down. As I said the game has both good and bad in it. But since I am a WW2 fan and I did very much enjoyed playing it depite its flaws. I gave it a thumbs up.Thanks for reading"

I'd also like to see dedicated servers and better tickrate/hit registration in the future as sometimes this game makes me want to put my mouse through my monitor and my wall it's so bad :D"

The multyplayer was very laggy and the graphics was glitching.The full release of the game seems a different story, the multyplayer works much better.At my surprise the single player campaign so far  is actually good (not excellent but keeps you engaged in the game).The multiplayer is not bad  and I am really enjoying the WAR and Search and DESTROY type of game.Overall here I would rate the game:Graphics:  8 out 10 Sound: 7 out 10 ( the sound does not immersive enough)Gameplay: Single and multy  Player is good  8 out 10What I really hate is the CP that must be purchased with real money and the  player is forced to level up to unlock the weapons ( seems like a standard in these days).However..... I think BF players would consider this game inferior because they are used to different meccanics and Call of duty seems a bit more ""Arcade"" to play but this does not make the game less fun.Overall is good game and a lot of fun and is the best CoD game of the recent years."

												Now we have what de waited so long for! No jetpacks anymore, now what remains is boots on the ground. I'm so happy that the CallofDuty Franchise still remember what it was back in the days of CoD2. I can't bear these guys that arent satisfied by this awesome game. Again, Thanks SledgeHammer for having listened to your old gamers."

												This game is actually pretty damn decent despite what people say. Sure this is not be any means my favorite game now, but it is a step in the right direction for call of duty. The guns in this game are awesome and they peak my interest to say the least. The combat is good as far as I have seen, the character customization is alright, and the graphics are great. I have played six hours of multiplayer so far and have only come across one hacker so this has lead me to believe that most of the bad reviews I have seen are simply mistaking really good players as hackers. My main problem with this game is that I get some lag and framerate issues which could partially be on my end. The worst part is the load times which are pretty bad but not quite as bad as something like GTA V. Overall I would love to see more people playing this game because it is the best COD I have seen in a while. 7/10"

												First the bad news.The campaign:  The voice acting is annoyingly bad with fake accents and unnecessary screaming.  What exacerbates the fingernails on chalkboard voices is the checkpoint system.  You will respawn to the annoying scream of an NPC, every...single...time.  The historical accuracy is completely off, and anyone who reads one legitimate book about World War II will figure that out right away.  There are many anachronisms in the game, too.  For instance, ""rhino"" tanks were not on the beaches of Normandy 6JUN44 (that's D-Day...also the civilian date format is used, not the military), German regulars using FG42s, etc.  These things are little things, but for any WWII history buff, they are annoying, especially when they start to pile up.  Further, the vehicle controls are completely messed up for the PC version.  If you play Warthunder, World of Tanks/Warplanes/Warships, or Armored Warfare, be prepared for a mouse throw.   Good job on making what should have been one of the best parts of the game sheer agony.  Multiplayer:  Multiplayer is more forgivable, if you enjoy that sort of thing.  However, it does seem to have ripped off every game from Battlefield 1 to Day of Defeat (yes I'm that old).  When did the CoD franchise go from leading the way to stealing other titles' multiplayer modes?  The challenges or the ""orders"" cause a lot of distraction to the game as people (myself included) are more focused on getting the challenge than winning the game.  There is the typical amount of mystery headshot streaks and bullets penetrating entire maps, but that is expected of any multiplayer game on PC, report and move on.  Zombies:  Haven't got that far yet.Ok the good news.  The campaign: Despite the woeful shortcomings that I have come to expect from this franchise, it is a fun game.  A lot of other reviews have stated it is the best CoD game in a while.  I would have to agree.  The campaign does have some interesting points and in-game events (no spoilers, except for the tank level sucks).  The story is not awful albeit very campy.  The campaign is a decent length and gives a sense of accomplishment when completed.  The graphics are amazing, and this is where the game really shines.  The visuals are tremendous and the cut scenes flow in and out of the game play perfectly.  You have to see them for yourself.  It is not taxing on the video card either, in fact, it runs better than Modern Warfare Remastered (for me at least) with the same settings.  Multiplayer is fun and interesting as long as you can get in a game.  ""War"" mode is my personal favorite.  It is an attack/defend strategic points mode.  Even though a big game mode (more than 12 players) would be nice, the small maps are great as my least favorite thing to do during a multiplayer match is to run across the map to get to the action, I mean get sniped, I mean get to the action (attention Battlefield).  The combat is quick and kinetic, like it should be in a CoD game.  I have only played the first level of zombies.  To be honest, I hate zombie mode in any of the titles so I wouldn't be a good source for this part of the game.Overall, if I had to give it a rating, it would be 7.5/10.  If the tank controls worked, it would be an 8 easily.  For the past few CoD titles, I would say they were worth the bargain bin prices that they've hit on Amazon and/or eBay.  However, this one is worth the $60 (I did get it as a Christmas present, but I would still buy it if I didn't); just don't use it as a historical reference point and good luck with the tank level."

												This review will be in two parts.** CAMPAIGN: Has many of the hallmarks of a classic Call of Duty single-player story. Some missions could easy fit in COD2 or World At War. It has all the staples and cliches you'd expect: on rails shooting galleries, lots of explosions, cheesy dialog, over-the-top moments and even a supernatural moment.The story has some highs and lows: characters are likeable enough while some are forgettable, which is expected in a war game. Our main character is... frankly, dull. He's a farmer, mix of innocence and humility, always in the looks to protect others, follow orders well and can take all kinds of punishment that an 80's action protagonist will go through. The development, albeit lacking sometimes, really lies between your superiors: Pierson and Turner, and their debate over how far a man should go to fulfill his duty. Some of the great moments also come from missions that try to break the mold a bit, when you have some stealth segments and even infiltrate as a german. Nothing innovative, the execution can be a bit mediocre at times (especially with the vehicle sections, which arguably were never Call of Duty's forte), but it's a nice change of pace from just shooting endless waves of enemies until you finally reach a particular spot on the map or a checkpoint.Wish they had made missions on different frontlines, maybe as the russians, but it's an understandable decision in order to keep the focus on a cast of characters. The campaign will take you through most of the US offensive in Europe, from the beaches of Normandy and re-taking France with the aid of the resistance, to deep into the german territory on the last winter of Hitler. There's a few moments scattered through the game of whether you should decide to kill surrendered Nazis or not, or save a fallen random soldier who's crying for help, but it doesn't seem to make any difference on the story or characters aside from one or two dialog lines. It's occasionally visually bold, throwing some gore to reflect the destruction and horrors of the war, which can be impressive sometimes. The locations and objectives are varied enough to keep it entertaining, and there were a few really tense movie-quality moments.At first I wasn't too excited about the change and comeback of the health bar, but I enjoyed it more and more as I went along; especially on higher difficulties, forcing you to act with more caution than ever. Your squad will be there to help you out, although I'd appreciate if they wouldn't repeat the same lines over and over when they have a medkit or an ammo pouch ready for you. If I can complain about one thing is the difficulty ramps this game has; for the most part, it's a fair challenge, but sometimes not so much. Lost count of how many times I was one-shot by an enemy just by turning a corner or walking through an open area with no way to predict where it could come from. Sometimes the game forces you to retreat to a position and you can't avoid the incoming shots; if the health system was the same from before, this could be dismissed as a tension spiking moment, but not when you have a finite resource and has no chance to save it. At the same time, some soldiers will take so much damage to die, and often they'll drop and shoot back at you while lying on the ground. The good use of grenades sometimes is inevitable to go through huge waves of enemies. Also, the auto-save checkpoints can put you in a very tight spot. Had one or two glitches, but nothing game breaking.This is by far the best looking game of the franchise; the voice acting is good and the facial animations and cutscenes were beautifully crafted. While it still holds some obsolete concepts and recycling of the previous titles, you'll find a solid and unmistakable Call of Duty gameplay. If you are a fan of COD for years, this is obviously a most anticipated return to the roots. All these years of B-movie plots might have taken the series through rough places with the fans, but I have a feeling that this time, they were at least trying to make it something more. Overall, I could recommend this game solely on the campaign, just not for the price they're asking. Short, but decent enough. I'll take a rehash of WW2 battles over some of the new things they have been putting out for the past 5 years, even with historical inaccuracies.** MULTIPLAYER: I'll keep this one short. It's messy. It plays like a completely different game, which is expected. I find hard to see myself enjoying playing the multiplayer for too long. It's obviously targeted for a younger audience; it's chaotic and incredibly fast-paced. Requires great skill and reflexes, especially to overcome some of the poor respawn placement, something that has also become a cliche of the series. Not to mention some odd and uninspiring level design. The maps are all very short, even the bigger ones. The War mode is certainly the most interesting addition, however it's plagued with poor design choices and unfair challenges depending on which side you play on. It feels like they were trying to go places, but decided to pull the break before really gettng anywhere, creating an experience that, to me, failed to impress. There isn't much to be said about loot boxes and the political correctness that hasn't been said already, so I'll just not go there. Haven't touched the Zombie mode; I'm sure it probably feels like a complete different game, just didn't grab my attention."

												Way better than ANY Call of Duty game since MW2.Started playing Multiplayer at 10 pm, was supposed to go to bed, stopped playing at 6 am.. I apologize for nothing!I've never been a fan of the older style war games, I HATE them with a fiery passion of 1000 suns, but this one was done very well in the entertainment value section.Haven't even tried the Campaign or Zombies yet, that's a journey for tomorrow.Is it worth it? YesPS: Not sure why people are bashing it for optimization, I'm running a GTX 970 and it runs flawlessly on max settings at 60 fps.Sounds like people think they have good PCs but they really don't, time to fix your crappy toaster or pay someone that knows how to do it. :)"

												By far the best Call of Duty in the past 5 years, the zombies is not too hard and the multiplayer's redeeming factor is the ""War"" mode. The single player campaign's story is terrible for the first half, but gets better later on. The game is a little pricey for the content currently offered if multiplayer is all that you are interested in ($80CDN). That being said i enjoy my time on the game so far."

												A truely refreshing expirence. after having a bunch of jetpack wallrunning future cods, its nice to see a call of duty back at its roots, with fun fast paced gameplay. im actually suprised at the negitivity to the game. as for multiplayer, i think its awesome. especially the war gamemode. there are a few op guns, and glithes but its the first week of the game so im not giving it too much♥♥♥♥♥♥ as for zombies i will say i enjoy more ""spawn and survive"" type maps like town from black ops 2, but the easter eggs are cool, and there is a casual mode that shows you how to solve the zombies puzzles which is nice. and the campaign is awesome. more charecter development than any of the past 3 cods. one HUGE gripe about it is the second to last mission where you drive a tank though. it is IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE THE TANK. no matter how high the sensitivity of your mouse is, the cannon just barely slides along to the point where i cant even beat it at recruit dfficulty. absolutely horrible. i cant finish the campaign because of it. hope it gets fixed. other than that, glad i purchased this gaame. i see many mor hours of fun to be had.

												A step in the right direction for COD. For the first time in a long time a Call of Duty game has peaked my interest and after some thought I gave in and bought it. And after a couple hours of playing I can say that I don't regret my purchase. I've not experienced any glaring issues with the game on the funcionality side. It both looks and runs better than Black Ops 3. The options menu had more to it tjhan I expected from a COD game. It doesn't feel too much and you can tell that they at least put a little time into the PC version. And no crashes or anything like that have happened thus far. \In terms of content, on the multiplayer side of things anyway, I've actually enjoyed it thus far. I feels like something akin to Black Ops 1, and personally I loved that game. The game doesn't hinder good players too well like the Call of Duty games of late. Gunfights feel pretty fair and I haven't noticed too much random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t getting me killed. This game isn't going to be something to finally win over new players, but if you liked the older COD games and have just lost interest over the years, you'll probably like this game if you get around to picking it up."

												I love this game, Multiplayer is awesome and all, but when I go to to play the campaign, my keyboard starts to lag, with inputs taking upwards of 5 seconds. Even the caps lock light takes five seconds to turn on after pressing the key. It is only in the campaign, and after I close call of duty and even steam the lag is still there. The only way to clear it is to restart the computer. I have a logitech keyboard and the gaming software installed, and i have tried it with the software both on and off. Anyhelp would be appreciated.

												We did it guys; we have waited for a good Call of Duty experince since Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 2, and this is it.Campaign mode: I've only gotten about an hour into it, but just that hour has been better than the last four COD campaign modes. Maybe even competing for the best campaign Call of Duty as given us.Zombie Mode: I have never been a huge fan of the ridiculousness that this mode has turned into. I prefered the simplistic waves and the ever rage enducing myster box of the original Zombies Mode from World at War gave us. These easter eggs are insane to learn, and the levels themselves are complex as hell. Which is what I am sure the people want. However, despite the incredible learning curve—I will most definitely need to watch Youtube walkthroughs—this mode should please casual and hardcore players.Multiplayer mode: By far the best since MW3. Never a fan of the Black Ops series multiplayer modes, especially BO3. Did not like Ghosts or Advanced Warfare. Let's not even bring up Infinite Warfare any further. The changes are a good step forward for what the game needed to stand out. However, I have never been a fan of TreyArch's score streak, which is what WW2 has adopted. Much prefer a legitimate kill streak. The assault rifles seem to be in a good spot. The sub machine guns definitely took a nerf since the beta, but they seem to be in a good spot. Shotguns are aggrivating as hell, but they are supposed to be up close. I would like to see their damage drop-off range tweeaked though; the shotguns seems to be able to have one-hit-kill potential at a range that the SMGs should be at their strongest. Snipers seem to be one-hit-kill anywhere even though the description says torso and above. My only gripe with the multiplayer right now is the fact that almost any wall I have come across allows bullets to travel through it. This includes metal, brick, and everything softer than those. This makes dominination and hard point quite difficult to get used to. Especially when you are at 100 percent health and you get killed by a sniper through wall material in the chest by a single shot. That needs to be changed.And the last thing:  PLEASE GOD ALMIGHT CHANGED THE MENU SCREEM TRANSITIONS FROM THE ENTER KEY TO SPACEBAR. I have to change my hand movement dramatically to hit an enter key versus just shifting my thumb over.Get rid of Supply Drops. Completely ruins the immersion of a game. Battlefield 4 did it right with gear being unlocked through assignments that were specifically for those things. Not random supply drops that more often give duplicates anyway."

												Just about asked for a refund; multiplayer running like s*&t and campaign mode full of glitches. THEN...... a fellow gamer suggested I update my AMD drivers, so I did and VOILA! Running awesome now. I almost always remember to update my drivers when I puchase a new title, but this time I had forgotten.Campaign is just awesome in my opinion; awesome character acting (best to date) and incredible sound and design.  I think people expect the moon from game developers nowadays; there's just no need to complain here.  Online play is a different story. Maps are small and to be honest, quite boring.  The worst part being the seemingly unstoppable hackers/cheaters who just love to♥♥♥♥♥♥everyone off.  It's quite pathetic actually.  The old adage ""first impressions go a long way"" is significant here, and I must say that I am not impressed with the online maps so far. It's important to point out however that the actual game design is very beautiful, it's just that the maps are far too small in comparrison to past releases or other titles such as Arma or Battlefield. I'd give it a try and formulate your own opinion, after all..... IT'S CALL OF DUTY MAN!"

												If you've played csgo for a long time and fallen back from it this is the review for you...I played Destiny 2 when it came out and it was trash.I had low expectations for this game and was only buying it for the multiplayer.A friend bought this for me and here is my review so far.Most of the negative reviews are not true. I have not gotten any network issues so far only when it qued for somewhere farther away after it couldn't find a game. Barely seen any bugs and if I have it's that the ui glitches. This can be fixed by restarting the game (only happened once to me). The leveling up and progression is very nice and I don't have to grind to unlock weapons. Supply drops are only cosmetic and I hope they stay that way. Some weapon variants look nice in the picture but are just the normal weapon but rusty *cough* machine pistol *cough* PLEASE FIX. Sniping is very satisfying and could be considered op, but at close range they don't stand a chance. Some weapons are op and overused but it will get fixed after a while. I bought this game because there are no other games I feel like playing and if I'm bored you best know I'm loading up some WW2 with netflix on the side. If you are bored like me get this game and have some good fun. (stop complaining that the servers are garbage when your internet is actually the culprit)"

For all of you ignorant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s claiming that this game is terrible because of the non-existance of swastikas in multiplayer and some of the historical flaws in singleplayer, you must realize that this is a ♥♥♥♥ing GAME!  You are playing it to enjoy yourself and have fun.  Most of you guys out there giving negative ratings are probably just doing it because you already were skeptical due to it being a Call of Duty game, and you would never give it a chance.  This game is one of the most enjoyable Call of Duty games I have ever played, especially since the release of things like Advanced Warfare and other such games.  I reccomend that if you already rated this game negatively, play for another good 20 hours, maybe with a friend for extra enjoyment, and then go back for your review, maybe this time while playing, pay attention to the other aspects that a game should be good in.  It's mechanics are amazing, and I have found no bugs yet surprisingly.  As for all of you complaining about how it runs, maybe wait for it to update more, as it came out just about 12 days ago, (as of the time this review is being written) it might have some form of issues, patience is your only chance more so."

												For the first 2 weeks of release i was enjoying this game soooo much!!! I wasn't having any of the problems that the majority of people were having. The game was running incredibly smooth and servers seem alright at the start. and then they decided to switch it back to Peer to Peer and all of a sudden every lobby had a decent amount of lag and it seemed like it paired you with a host from a different country most of the time. and as of yesterday i have been getting a Error Code 5 message which i have researched and there is really nothing to fix it on PC because Activision has not responded to a single post on there support websits. Also TONS of people are now getting this error code. and if this broken of a game does have any kind of support system brom the billions of dollars they make off of the game and ther buyable loot boxes, then i don't think anyone should buy this game! P.S. i have about 40 hours on multiplayer but for the steam page it only shows 1 hour from campaign."

												Game no longer has a competitive feel , it's lost its way and now caters for the casual jump in gamer , it used to be a game where everyone was equal , no advantages over anyone .The gameplay was skilful , you could jump in but it took you a while to master the movement plus challenging recoil .. Now in the latest instalment guns have no recoil , movement is slightly dumbed down gun attachments ruin any kind of balance and look awful in game , killstreaks destroy the game , perks ruin the balance .. game looks pretty but other than the multiplayer gameplay is terrible Single player I was hopeful for but everything is a cutscenes and the game should have memorable scenes ... desperate attacks and feelings of actually being there and trying to help keep ""ai"" alive ... not this game however .. poorly scripted .. sounds too bassy ...However it's nice to jump on for 30 minutes when you're bored .. is it worth paying hundred pound for ? No ... not at all ...."

												As many other reviewers; this game already has many cheaters, a fact about which slegdehammer seems to not care at all as every one reports them (it is clearly visible on the replay that a auto aim type cheat is being used), as long as sales are good. Secondly it is infurating that this game makes you watch the replay and all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that happesn postgame remains unskippable, this literally makes me want to break my keyboard after a harsh loss. Talking about harh losses, when I heard this game would go back to the roots I expected a very good campaign (which we don't have; it barely fills a day of gaming) and long range maps as the classic MP_pavlov from cod I not just modern warfare type maps with WO II weapons!In short no love lost on this game, not from me but also clearly not from the makers...."

												I bought this game having stopped playing Cod largely due to the direction the games were taking, however I am surprised with this game in several ways.  First the annoying stuff, the game is overpriced as hell but that's usual for Cod at this point, of course I could spend hours talking about historical accuracy problems with the game, for example Russian Ppsh's on Normandy (although some German units did equip captured Ppsh's none of those units were on the Western Front) however when I bought this game I knew I was in for a cartoon simulator for WW2 not a historical game or realistic game.  In this reguard the game is effective it is essentially a normal Cod game with a theme of WW2 in the background, sue them for bad marketing but I knew it was a Cod game so I expected some over the top marketing.  Essentially treat this game as if it's a Cod Ghosts or Black Ops game where the only guns are from the WW2 era and the maps are only European themed, don't buy this game expecting anything more then that and you might be surprised how much fun you can have."

												Wow where to start. most of the negative comments are true so no reason to repeat them. Super unbalanced weapons, pistols seem stonger and more accurate than many of the weapons in HC. The game seems riddled with hackers. No ability for people to vote hackers out of a game in progress. The supply drops are glitchy randomly vanish after much hard work earning them. Support seem to be ignoring everyones concerns. Very dissapointing purchase but hey the graphics look really nice."

I have multiplayer graphics on full and I run 60fps but I have everything on low for campaign and run 20 with lag spikes.

												I see all of these people complaining about how ""Historically inaccurate"" this game is and how it had it's ""Connection issues"", But people will find any excuse to jump onto a hate-wagon these days. I try my best to have an unbiased opinion.Anyway, After about a month of the game being out, I have to say that I personally LOVE this game. Yeah it's innacurate at parts but it's a video game. AND The PC Optimization this time around is almost spot on. Definitely an improvement from the last few.Campaign: I find the campaign is somewhat stale at times but for the most part it's pretty intense and just fun to play. You get your typical COD missions where ot's just run and gun, Then you get your usual stealth mission, Only this time it has an actually decent stealth system. I give it a 7/10Multiplayer: Having played the beta I already knew which game mode was going my be my go to. War. If you've played Day of Infamy or even Day of Defeat then you already know what to do in this. You have a certain set of objectives on each map and you must either complete them or stop the enemy from completing. Havent played much of the other modes so Hard to say for sure. I give it a 7.5/10And finally, Zombies. I went into zombies expecting just another survival sorta deal as it's been for over 10 years now. And I am so glad I was wrong. You have actual Objectives and goals to complete that will keep you interested. Atleast it keeps me interested. Although I cant say much about the last 2 zombies games as I havent played them. I give it 8/10Overall I think this is a pretty outstanding game for COD. My final mark will be a 7.5/10.My specs:Nvidia GTX 970 4GBIntel Core i5-7600K16GB DDR4 RAM650w Power Supply2TB Seagate HDD"

												I will start by saying that I am a COD veteran, I love COD, so obviously I want to love this game. But yet there are many, MANY issues with this game. Balance is out of wack, the shovel is way to poerfull for exemple. Team balacing is horrible at best. Server stability is no bad, but I have came across a lot of disconnects. Worst of it all, chaters. I mean, this is ridicoulous. Already in Beta they where out, but the situation is worst then what they are saying. Aimbot's, wall hacks are plenty. In fact so far I have seen cheaters every 4-5 games, tops. My advice, wait for now, DO NOT buy this right now, wait for them to iron out the issues and get rid of the hackers."

												THIS REVIEW IS ALMOST COMPLETELY MULTIPLAYER AND ZOMBIES RELATED!!! TIME PLAYED IS ONLY COUNTING THE TIME IN SINGLEPLAYER!!I originally enjoyed this game when it was first released... but I've finally opened my eyes to the fact that it feels just like every other boots on the ground COD, nothing special... The gameplay id fun for about 5 - 10 minutes before you realise that you've experienced all the game has to offer on the Multiplayer front, all of the gamemodes  are the same as they always have been, just with a War gamemode, which I can argue is the best part of the Multiplayer... But even this can get repettetive. There is also hackers in the game already and that is unacceptable for a mainstream AAA game. Also Loot Boxes Galore... mostly cosmetics at this point with a few Weapons WHICH can be unlocked by completing 50 matches for ONE... Not a great way of handling that... As I said earlier on... I first played this game actually enjoying it... but soon found out that there wasn't many differences between this one and some of the older ones... (Go back and play World at War, there is hackers but there is also better servers and mod support for Zombies).I have only played the singleplayer for about 6 minutes to set up controls and graphics settings, but I've played the multiplayer for about 11 hours so I've got enough time under my belt to make a decent review. (Didn't actually play the Campaign as I saw reviews saying it wasn't what was expected and wasn't as authentic as Sledgehammer Games said it would be... Never been interested in a COD Campaign since Black Ops 2...)If you're looking for a historical FPS that is actually authentic, go for Day of Imfamy or Battlefield 1. Both of these games are worth it and don't lock weapons behind loot boxes (Weapon skins are in BF1 though)...Dont waste your money like I did..."

												COD:WW2 Is a very fun game all around with a lot of content. I'll do this review in three seperate ways, Multiplayer, Zombies and Campaign.Campaign Pros:- A surprisingly good story with well written characters. Kinda blew me away at the end.- Stealth sections are quite good if not a little basic.- Gameplay felt like there was more compared to other cods.- I think it's alright length. It's a little short but ends before it would start to get boring.- Incredibly good opening.- Cutscenes look incredible.Campaign Cons:- The set pieces are done before. Actually incredibly done before. Not a ton of change for a war game.- Tank controls are terrible on keyboard. Second I switched to controller i finished the part.- Sniper made it way too easy.Multiplayer Pros:- Core COD gameplay continues to be fun as hell.- Graphics look nice.- Progression system is actually alright. (other than ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lootboxes)- Lots of custimization on guns, soldiers and emblems etc.- A good amount of game modes.Multiplayer Cons:- Lootboxes.- Needs more maps.- Half the maps kinda suck.- Missing some core COD modes.Zombies Pros:- Good map.- Characters are likeable.- Revamping the way the zombies move, look and the way the mystery box and everything else has been changed makes it feel fresh.- Very fun mode to play for an hour or so.- Zombies don't just follow you in a train anymore, they feel quite smart.- Other zombie types are actually quite freaky and i dread seeing them.Zombies Cons:- Still only one core map.- The first 12 waves feel too easy to be honest.- Lines get repeated very quickly.- The little jumpscares get old after the first 2 times.Overall COD:WW2 is a very solid package. Good Multiplayer, Story Mode and Zombies. I recommend it strongly to COD fans and FPS fans.8/10."

												4/10pretty poor game for pc (plaing with or against a hacker 1/5 of the time). Ranked matchmaking is horrible. the gameplay itself is accually pretty good, but 0 matchmaking in casual games (as a lvl 42 0 prestige i played v a 500+ master prestige worlds highest), he got double V2 on my team. It is not a fun game, if you expect to have fun from the beginning. needs a long grind, with other horrible players that also ruins the experience.i have played 100+ hours and im still playing v better players most of the time (and no its not cos i suck, though i am not that good). good games i get 4 K/D, bad games i get 0,2 K/D... thats what matchmaking does in this game"

												Darn, I can't recommend this game. I actually love it. It's very fun to pop on some headphones and rock out to music while running around the maps like I did 15 years ago when I last played PC games.The issue I am having is that the community is dead already and the game has barely been out for a month. I like Carentan 24/7 but never play it because I can't get in a game. I like Domination and Hardpoint but good luck getting 12 people in a game to play it.  TDM is really boring to me but that's where most of the people play.  Sadly, the game modes that I love just don't have the multiplayer base that is required.I see the same names all the time in Carentan which means that very few of us are playing.  I have not even started the single player campaign and probably never will.  I don't care at all about the story or historical accuracy.  Last time I checked there wasn't a breakout of Zombies attacking WW2 soldiers so I'm not all about ""keeping it real"".I'm a pretty lousy player but I really like this game.  I guess there will be an influx of players after Christmas and again when the first DLC maps are released but what a pain to wait that long to just get in a few games.Oh well, TDM it is."

												I am so impressed with COD WWII.   Back to basics, boots on the ground, and it IS awesome.  The graphics are sharp and my TI1050 handles them well.  Game play is excellent - intense, OMG moments galore, and the occassional OMFG moment too.  I like the having to get to the medic for health when it's low, and ammo to from another.  Realistic.  I would hightly recommend this game to anyone who loves first person shooters that WILL challenge you, even on the Recruit level.  The mementos are difficult to fine and a challange, especially looking for them during battle.  I love it."

If yes, this game is perfect for you! otherwise no, don't even dare to touch this game because it is very simple to play and anyone looking for coordinated teamplay is going to be dissapointed. Literally you can easily get a 10 killstreak with a melee weapon in just one building because no one informs each other of the location of other people. But this is not a bad thing because it makes the game into a fun arcade shooter. It is nowhere as good as the older cod games but if you are looking for a modern, chill game then you should get this. This is only the review of the multiplayer but the zombies mode is fun to play and it has some fun puzzles. Also the campaing is entertaining and basically like a michael bay movie (the story is mediocre). I'd give it a 7.5/10"

After that, the real issues started.After I choose to continue with lvl 3, the game crashes.Every time I rebooted the game, the moment I click on the campaign button, the game crashes again.I tried updating all my drivers, I even reinstalled my OS, but nothing helped.Hardware wise, my PC should be able to pull it just fine.Never before have I played a AAA title that was this buggy, even in my time as a game tester.UPDATE:After one week, I tried again, and it seems the crashes are fixed.The campaign is ok, all be it a bit short. Replay value is quite low, since there are a lot of very long cutscenes I cannot skip and have to watch again, even though I already completed the game.So all with all, I still do not recomand this game, unless you want to play it for the graphics alone, which are incredible. At some point I was even wondering whether the cutscenes were animated or recorded. In my humble opinion, a game should be about more than graphics though."

												*200+ hours COD WWII MultiiplayerI've originally been a long time Battlefield player but overtime I became more interested in the infantry aspect of Battlefield which then led me into playing an old COD which was MW3.I enjoyed the fast paced style COD offered. So I was excited upon the launch of COD WII.Overall the game is what I enjoy and expected. My main gripe with the game is the healing time is just too slow and most of the time a second engagement will often end in a death.There is also some annoying bugs but hopefully they get ironed out overtime like most new release games do these days.****HOWEVER! My experience has been extremely tarnished due to hackers running rampant.I am always vigilant reporting hackers through the COD WWII interface as well as through steam yet I still see the same abusers day in day out.On average every 3rd game I experience a clean lobby before someone comes and ruins the match.This is extremly disappointing. From my experience on Battlefield 4 (1200+ hours) it was a rare sight to run into hackers.I feel like the PC community is really being let down by Sledgehammer by not actively fixing this HUGE problem in a timely manner and on top of this providing patches alot later than the console community are served.Conclusion: I would of recommend COD WWII if you want your typical COD style FPS action with a WWII skin with a few weird quirks and innaccurate historical features.But unfortunately I can not recommend this game as it is tarnished by cheaters."

												So.... i have come back and edited this review 3 times. each times my issues are getting worse and i have been speaking to people in games and in HQ and im glad to find out it isn't just me. Before i start my PC is above the required spec and i have tried various different trouble shooting methods which have helped but not resolved the issue. The fact we have to do this in the first place, i think speaks volumes and the fact people can make decent YT channels trying to fix these issues also says alot. I load in zombies (this is happening less now and i have been able to complete the easy easter egg). and randomly it will crash doesn't matter what round or how many people i am playing with it will just crash. No error message the game just closes randomly. I go to load the game and it says somethign like , The game didn't close correctly do you want to start in safe mode, i click ok and then once laoded ins afe mode i exit and reload so it is nolonger in safe mode ( i have played in safe mode previously and still got the same issues). It will be fine for a few hours maybe a day ro 2 and then the crashes start again. MULTIPLAYER - The lack of persitent servers/Hosted servers is a joke at this point. How much money have cod devs made and they still wont pay for decent servers? what a f***** joke. The game runs without issue sometimes other times it just lags like s***. My signal is always 3 green bars and i sometimes think its my ocnnections and then play other games with no issue and also do a speed test and get between 60 - 70 mb down and 9mb up not the best but certainly not the cause of these issues, and like i said i dont have this issue with any other games. You don't know if people are cheating or if its just the gaming running s*** randomly. I WOULD HIGHLY ADVISE NOT TO BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE. 50% off yeh why not but not full price. It pretty much runs like a beta. I stopped playing COD around BO3 as i felt the game got very stale and had some bad launch's (which games don't nowadays right?) so after many eyars off from the franchise i saw this and came back only to be hyped at first to then realise it has the same glaring issues as most previous cods. I guess if people keep buying your product why change, well they do change things but only in the sense of skins and more Micro Transactions. DO NOT BUY AT FULL PRICE AND IF YOU'RE GAME IS RUNNING LIKE S*** 50% OF THE TIME ITS NOT JUST YOU (unless you're pc spec doesn't meet requirements then it proabably is). One last thing i forgot which is a easy fix to a couple of running issue i found, In Graphics settings you cans elect windowed, windowed without border or full screen, my settings kee changing back to windowed or windowed without border and this drains my fps to anywhere between 30 - 50 constantly changing. I realise and change back to fullscreen and my FPS is stable at around 115-118."

												The singleplayer campaign is in my opinion really enjoyable. It gives the nostalgic feeling from when I played the old Medal of Honors, Allied Assault for example. The campaign includes sneaking, rushing, sniping, and even undercover missions. For now, nothing to complain about. Haven't played the multiplayer though, but that's not why I bought the game."

												I've had a lot of time with this game and I have read a lot of the negative reviews. While a few of them seem to be justified, Call of Duty has a commonplace for being the communities punching bag. (rightfully earned with the last few releases) Though, this games biggest problem is probably the menu design and its fluidity/function. Even without dedicated servers, the lag or connection hasn't been that bad. Sure, I had a couple orange connection games, but what's so hard about leaving and finding a new lobby? This game really deserves better from the toxic community, because it really does do justice to its genre. The game is absolutely stunning in terms of multiplayer smoothness and all of the guns from the wwII era feel exactly where we've wanted Call of Duty to be since Black ops 2. The over-all janky-ness, fire-rate, recoil from the weapons feel absolutely right and punishes those who are used to laser beam accuracy handed to us with previous titles. The multiplayer map design feels more fluid and works well with all game modes, this is the first title I’ve played where I genuinely enjoy playing all of the maps. (thank god there's no more nuketown) But to further emphasize the condition of the maps, there are a lot of hidden spots on all of the maps specifically for snipers, its mind-blowing really and will go un-noticed if you aren't a sniper. This goes for all of the maps, so don't worry about being punished for wanting to snipe in call of duty, it almost feels encouraged. When experiencing score-streaks, whether it’s a flamethrower, barrage of artillery, or paratroopers, it has a distinct experience to it. Such as when bombs explode, the whole world shakes, goes hazy, interrupts your aim. It’s an actual “experience” and not just a simple feature.TLDR:+ Amazing fresh take for wwII weapons+Well thought-out 3 lane mapping (No longer punishes snipers)+Dedicated servers reinstated+Slower more methodical gameplay (No jet packs)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Menu design is not “toaster” friendly which can be confusing-Weapon classes / attachments do not save (sometimes)-Community unjustly condemns this game in their reviews 	With all of the haters aside telling us about how crappy their connection is, or how terrible the guns are, or how the historical inaccuracies offend them (huge wwII buff btw, i don't have a problem with it, its a GAME...), this game is the long-awaited release we all could have hoped for. Do not let these negative reviews get to you, I can't believe how blind the hate-train is towards Call of Duty, but then again Advanced Warfare happened so... Give this game an honest shot, don't listen to the sheeple."

												Call of Duty: WWII is a great entry into the long-running series. Sledgehammer has done a fantastic job in creating a Call of Duty that will appeal to contemporary fans and those fans who might have favourable memories of earlier games in the series. Like me. It often walks a fine line between thoughtful representation of World War II and typical Call of Duty flamboyance, but it’s a line that Sledgehammer walks with absolute confidence. And they derserve to do so! The result is a Call of Duty that feels assured of what it’s trying to accomplish, and what it accomplishes is riveting, entertaining and at times hard-hitting. Do not even hesitate!Sledgehammer sure did a huge job repairing the issues showing in the Beta (well, an enormous amount of them at least) and it's a CoD playing exactly by the books."

												Call of Duty WW2:New year, new call of duty. At this point, almost everyone knows what the Call of Duty franchise is - most people have probably played an installment of this title. Deciding to go back to their roots, Sledgehammer Games developed Call of Duty World War II, looping back to one of the first Call of Duty’s -- Call of Duty World at War which was set in both parts of the Pacific theatre and a little of the European theatre. However, in World War II the player is submerged solely into the European side of things. I will do this review in three parts, because the campaign, multiplayer, and nazi zombies modes are all different and deserve their own focus.For starters - the campaign, to be blunt it could have improved… drastically. There was not much effort put into the story, the writing is quite poor for a triple A title. It is both predictable and lazy, with little to no character depth - there isn’t much to care about, any person who has played a video game before will not enjoy this campaign. The missions are relatively repetitive, mostly holding X position for Y amount of time until you have to relocate and do it again. Yes it’s enjoyable to run around shooting things and being the war hero CoD sets you up to be, it ends quickly and most people will be left with a feeling of “Really, that’s it?” All in all, for anyone who's played a game before - you will not appreciate the campaign for it’s repetitive and lazy style. Multiplayer: The CoD franchise has always had a heavy focus on it’s multiplayer, thankfully Sledgehammer Games took into account the complaints of the previous few titles - which was the dislike of the ability to fly around the map with jetpacks and such. While many view that as an improvement, there is nothing new in the multiplayer. If you have played a previous Call of Duty multiplayer, you have played Call of Duty WW II’s multiplayer, everything is the same aside from the adition to the new war game mode which offers attack and defense style play. While this is a cool mode to play, all of the attack routes are funnels - not much effort was put into map design that would encourage players to outthink and outmaneuver their opponent.. Just the usual CoD run & gun. To sum it up, it can be fun if you enjoy just casually running around and dueling people, anything more than that you will be disappointed.Finally, Nazi Zombies. The Call of Duty franchise has gained relative notability for it’s zombie horde mode. Grabbing three friends and indulging on some good ol’ zombie killin’ is quite fun, as it has been in previous Call of Duty’s. This time there’s a twist - with actual objectives to complete, there’s more for the player to do - rather than race around the map mowing down hoards of the undead… in WW II you have the ability to complete tasks AND mow down hordes of the undead. Having actual tasks to complete adds a sense of accomplishment and gives a bit of challenge for the player, a good addition most would say. As a whole, the zombies is solid as always and helps recover a bit from the laziness applied to the campaign. The game as a whole doesn’t offer any groundbreaking features - it’s just regular old fashioned Call of Duty - which the regular gamer will enjoy. While there were not many changes or additions to the multiplayer, it’s still a game that you can load up and relax while playing around, and the challenging objectives in zombies make up a bit for the laziness devoted to the campaign. For the average gamer, it’s a 7/10 that will give you a decent amount of enjoyable playtime."

												-=Best Call of Duty in years=-I barely played the last few, for a lot of reasons, such as the inability to unbind the jetpack dash garbage, unmemorable weapons and sounds and poor level design.  This one is a breath of fresh air! -=PROS=--Sounds are ACE, get some nice 7.1 and go to town-Level design, mantling, smooth edges for maps is pretty well done-New system, as much as I enjoyed Pick10 Create A Class, their new approach is pretty good with divisions-Player Prestige doesn't reset weapon progress (I think BO2 & 3 did that) so you can prestige and work on weapons again without losing all progress!-HEADQUARTERS!  I sounds gimmicky but it really does add a nice level to the game.  You can go to the firing range to test attachments, practice with all the scorestreaks for free, 1v1 pit combat with spectators, and interact with other players and show off your gear.  Very cool feature that is much better than it sounded.  (Think Destiny Tower, instead of just a blank lobby waiting screen)-Getting thrown into a match in progress and losing will not negatively effect your statsx|CONS|x-Interface needs help, menus aren't easy to find (must be in this submenu then hit a hotkey to even find this whole menu, ect..)-I'd LOVE if we could FFA with friends and still earn progress, I realize it's an anti-boosting measure, but people will stat pad no matter what, let us kill our friends!-WAR maps seem poorly designed with sometimes down to literally ONE chokepoint-Lots of PC features not present, small Quality of Life like holding backspace when typing, hitting esc and bringing up the menu when the match finishes, skipping end-of-round trophy stage, lots of stuff just feels clunky with menus and interaction, but when you're in a match, it's got everything you'd expect.-Splitscreen is local only, can't let friends come over and frag with me online, which nobody does anymore, but if you're going to advertise local co-op and splitscreen, let us play online like the good ol' days. Current issues:  Servers crashing, end of match about 60% of the time I get ""disconnected from server"" and it boots me from my party and into another match without them.Questions?

												The game is Okay.. nothing great. You can tell that they were trying to make all the SJWs happy so they put Female soldiers into the game and didnt use swastikas.. But those are just little things.The campaign.. I really like how they added a health bar back into the game.. but the campaign is pretty much just a movie  that you play a little.. they really hold your hand through out the game.Zombies.. Its pretty fun if you've liked zombies.. but the map is kinda small.. which means you can unlock every door in a short amount of time... They also added objectives which are pretty fun and are a challenge..  I just wish the map was bigger or there was another map you could play... and I wish they added the ray gun or some other power weapons beside the tesla gun**UPDATE** This zombies is super easy compared to the older ones.. its super hard to lose.. and once you beat the boss your pretty much done and just have to die if you dont want to keep going.Multiplayer.. Really dissapointed with the multiplayer.. there are barely any maps.. not alot of guns.. and it seems like people take a long time to connect to games.. it always takes a few minutes for the teams to fill up.. **UPDATE** After playing a little more.. it feels like ALL weapons that you have are just like Pea shooters compared to what everyone else has.. it takes so long to get a kill.. and while everyone else kills you in a few shots.. it doesnt seem balanced at all.. and the online community seems really toxicOverall I would recommend the game if you like quick run and gun games..This will probably be the last cod I buy unless they get their stuff together and get rid of this garbage supply drop and actually add content"

												I don't understand why local co-op is advertised here when its not even possible. That is very misleading unless it's going to be placed in the game further on which I highly doubt. Also the story mode auto save feature is complete garbage. This is my third attempt at completing the story since my saved data seems to be gone every single time I try to play the campaign. I now have to dedicate a couple hours on the weekend to play the game straight through with no breaks since my data goes missing everytime I try to get back to the campaign at a later date. But this game doesn't sell for the story mode and possibly for some others like me who look forward to games with some local co-op, especially since it's advertised and a feature that was in previous games. The multiplayer is great with the exception of some divisions being superior than the others. Mountain class with my first week experience in multiplayer, people were quick scoping me like they been playing this game for months. Sniping in the game in my opinion, should not be easy to the point that an entire lobby was doing it. I felt like I was playing a custom game of quick scopes only. If all you care about in this game is multiplayer and zombies go right ahead and purchase this game. But if you care about ww2 story mode and the actual history of the event. This game is not for you and good luck with your campaign saved data. I read some other comments and it seems I'm not the only one with this issue."

												Please add a vote kick system so that when people who are playing Zombies are not willing to end the game or do the easter egg, we can kick them so we can at least earn 3 hours worth of xp.Or:Please make sure that we save our xp when we quit.And if you meet this guy, quit the game, cause he's the representation of people I'm talking about. The hardcore easter egg is hard enough as is, and I was finally able to set up everything for hardcore easter egg after many failed tries. Instead of being able to do the easter egg, this guy wouldn't bother doing anything. He's apparently Norwegian, and I spoke English and Norwegian to him to get him to pick up his tesla gun upgrade and come do the hardcore easter egg. But nope, he didn't bother replying, he didn't answer at all, and he wouldn't die when we wanted to end the game. As a result, I had to leave after spending 3 hours on trying to do the hardcore easter egg because of this guy. The other 2 people who was on board with what I was trying to do had to leave as well, and none of us earned our xp.http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marvelousj4/Unfortunately, this game doesn't have any anti-troll system, which is why I'm asking for a votekick system or a keep-your-xp-when-you-leave bypass system."

												The Zombies mode in this game is great. Other than that it is a complete waste of time. Time to kill in multiplayer is ridiculous: so much so, that it's seriously not even fun to play.

												Huh, where should I start.It's mediocre. For me the story was meeting the standards of other COD storylines, maybe more on the emotional side, but that was expected since it is a WW2 game. Despite that fact, the stealth part of the story was made better then before, the gameplay and overall mission segments kept me interested in the story enough for me to finnish it and like it.The multiplayer is just COD usual multiplayer. Yes I liked it WHEN it came out when everyone was trying out new stuff and the time to kill was slower then now when everyone is running around with smg's just like every other cod. Nothing new to look for here. War is not as bad but it still feels like a capture the flag type of gameplay with segments.Zombies. Well yeah I played for about 6 rounds in general and with that time played I liked it. It's, dare I say, scarier then usual and brings a bit of a horror factor to the game.Overall:The game is OK, it's not worth 60€ and the season pass is overrated. I would give it a 6/10, BUT would not recommend it at a full price. It is better then previous cods (talking from cod ghosts forward), but still needs to have work done."

												If you are planning on getting this for multiplayer, don't. This game is plagued with hackers. I played a bit during launch week and only got into a handful of matches with hackers. After taking some time off, I decided to play WWII this weekend... 3 out of 5 matches were overrun by hackers. I am talking multiple aimbots in a single match. It has become absolutely ridiculous.There is no point in dedicating time to hone your combat skills when some jabroni is just going to aimbot you out of existence.It does have split screen, but unless you are planning on playing a private match, it is still unenjoyable. You'll just be two targets for the aimbot, rather than the one.Decent campaign, but nothing to write home about. It was pretty predictable, and a bit historically inaccurate."

												What we have here is a very well made Call of Duty. And I don't mean that because of the whole BOOTS ON DA GROUND hype (I enjoyed advanced movement of BO3). The gameplay is solid along with guns, not counting some odd quirks like low fire rate PPSh or magazine-fed Toggle-Action Shotgun. While the multiplayer is fun and addictive, I can't say the same about the single player part of the game. It's filled with cliches and some serious BS moments which can really ruin the immersion sometimes (e.g. the Michael Bay train wreck). Zombies are alright I guess. I strongly recommend it BUT wait a few weeks before the game is properly patched. Get it around Christmas. Cheers."

												So.... i have come back and edited this review 3 times. each times my issues are getting worse and i have been speaking to people in games and in HQ and im glad to find out it isn't just me. Before i start my PC is above the required spec and i have tried various different trouble shooting methods which have helped but not resolved the issue. The fact we have to do this in the first place, i think speaks volumes and the fact people can make decent YT channels trying to fix these issues also says alot. I load in zombies (this is happening less now and i have been able to complete the easy easter egg). and randomly it will crash doesn't matter what round or how many people i am playing with it will just crash. No error message the game just closes randomly. I go to load the game and it says somethign like , The game didn't close correctly do you want to start in safe mode, i click ok and then once laoded ins afe mode i exit and reload so it is nolonger in safe mode ( i have played in safe mode previously and still got the same issues). It will be fine for a few hours maybe a day ro 2 and then the crashes start again. MULTIPLAYER - The lack of persitent servers/Hosted servers is a joke at this point. How much money have cod devs made and they still wont pay for decent servers? what a f***** joke. The game runs without issue sometimes other times it just lags like s***. My signal is always 3 green bars and i sometimes think its my ocnnections and then play other games with no issue and also do a speed test and get between 60 - 70 mb down and 9mb up not the best but certainly not the cause of these issues, and like i said i dont have this issue with any other games. You don't know if people are cheating or if its just the gaming running s*** randomly. I WOULD HIGHLY ADVISE NOT TO BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE. 50% off yeh why not but not full price. It pretty much runs like a beta. I stopped playing COD around BO3 as i felt the game got very stale and had some bad launch's (which games don't nowadays right?) so after many eyars off from the franchise i saw this and came back only to be hyped at first to then realise it has the same glaring issues as most previous cods. I guess if people keep buying your product why change, well they do change things but only in the sense of skins and more Micro Transactions. DO NOT BUY AT FULL PRICE AND IF YOU'RE GAME IS RUNNING LIKE S*** 50% OF THE TIME ITS NOT JUST YOU (unless you're pc spec doesn't meet requirements then it proabably is). One last thing i forgot which is a easy fix to a couple of running issue i found, In Graphics settings you cans elect windowed, windowed without border or full screen, my settings kee changing back to windowed or windowed without border and this drains my fps to anywhere between 30 - 50 constantly changing. I realise and change back to fullscreen and my FPS is stable at around 115-118."

												Disclaimer: I haven't played any of the latest COD so can't compare with thoseWhile not perfect, COD WW2 is clearly a fast paced, fun experience with a well integrated loot system (unlike some of the concurrent *coughs battlefront II*The game looks gorgeous, the solo had a sound bug which stopped any sound being played on mission 2 but aside of that it looks fine and challenging.Multiplayer is where it's at however. Lots of different modes: dominations (zone capture), ctf, war (scenaristic objectives), tdm, hardpoint (king of the hill), ffa, gridiron (some sort of american football thingy), search and destroy and kill confirmed (need to grab the tags of the enemy you kill and deny tags from your own kia) in addition there is the zombie coop mode for those who are into this sort of stuffs. So it catters to everyone's taste or almost. Each mode has specific sound cues which helps focusing your team and it's really well done (just like the specific sound for hits and headshots)Loot boxes are cosmectic only but you get different weapons with levels so the early levels can be a bit frustrating. Also the game is fast paced, there is little point playing as a team most of the time as depending on the mode you can repop pratically anywhere (even in the back of enemies). It's mostly a run and gun game (again objective based modes are somewhat different but there isn't a single mode where standing still is a good thing as the killcam will reveal your location anyway). The good thing is that you can get pretty much anything in any lootboxes so it's not rare to have epic items in regular lootboxes, however it's not rare either to have meh things in rare lootboxes either. But the game randomly gives lootboxes after every win so it's definitely possible to unlock things without paying which is great.Uniforms are beautiful and collecting them for each of your division soldier is compelling and fun.What are the downsides?- The pace: it is NOT realistic at all, some people will jump like bunnies, there is little planning to do, it's definitely not as realistic as it looks. The bullet spray is low, incendiary ammo is ridiculous and sniper shooting without aiming but hitting as long as they hit the scope button are laughable (unless you are on the receiving side)- the sound: it's not bad but definitely could be better, esp the different guns- the hitboxes: I suppose because it's first and foremost a console game the hitboxes are somewhat big, you can get killed by a shot next to your head, or in your backpack. Also as it's fast paced a little bit of netcode issue and you end up with someone who is not where he appears to be (rarely but happens)- cheaters: while not as common as people claim (some people have really impressive skills), there definitely are cheaters around. The worse I have seen was a guy who only had to push on the shoot button and his character will turn around like crazy and headshot everone in sight, some have auto aim/headshots, others seem to do more damage but it's definitely not in every game. Still they should really react more to reports than they actually do (a cue that people have been banned would also help people feel less paranoid)- community can be a bit toxic esp that the game puts you with fellow countrymen, europeans and as people know some groups are more annoying than others. - team audio, most of the time you can't hear anything compared to some other games which have made it very easy to use and with good quality this is a downside.- low ammount of maps (not fond of having the maps in the season pass as it'll divide players)So yeah it's definitely not perfect, it can be frustrating at times but it's still one of the best progression system out there and a very good fast paced fps when the teams are right. Make sure it's your thing before buying or wait a sale."

												Story: Awesome, as short as the story is said to be, I found it enjoyable with the cutscenes, and the gameplay.Multiplayer: If you liked past Call of Duty's multiplayer, you'll probably enjoy this one. Also, if you hated infinite warfare and stuff because of jetpacks, and wall sliding, well fear no more because there's none of that in this game. It's like they said, it's the roots of COD. Nazi Zombies: Best zombies in cod hands down. They've made the experience better imo. I really do like how you can run through the zombies without getting stuck now, awesome feature. It's also a little bit more scary, which made it feel better and more alive when playing.Problems: Performance is one of the things I thought COD was best at. For me most of the maps run at sixty frames, no issues, but one of the maps dips down to forty frames, and from what I've heard a good amount of people also have performance issues. There's also some glitches, but for me I've not encountered too many.OVERALL: I'd give this game a solid 8.3/10. It's COD in it's roots."

												Launch was a mess.Servers were shakey and the loading screens are ridiculous.But then I loaded into a game of Zombies, and that was a fresh experience.  Anyone that immediately calls this game trash is jumping on the bandwagon and the CoD hate train.  The game has potential to be a great PC experience, but that may be where the steam community is so takenaback by.  The devs need to focus on the PC community and bring the new features that they are releasing for consoles onto the PC version.  I currently have about 20 hours played between online multiplayer and zombies (I have yet to load the campaign, but I will eventually).  It's fun, in my opinion, the zombies alone will yield many hours of gameplay, and if you are a fan of the Call of Duty franchise pre-jetpack era, you will not be disappointed.  I do believe that the devs shot themselves in the foot with the awful release they had, unacceptable!  But they seem to be rolling out new updates almost weekly, and if this presists then we could be in for a good year of Call of Duty.  Also...there is not a requirement that you purchase loot boxes, so stop leaving negative reviews because a company is trying to make extra money out of stupid consumers."

												Huh, where should I start.It's mediocre. For me the story was meeting the standards of other COD storylines, maybe more on the emotional side, but that was expected since it is a WW2 game. Despite that fact, the stealth part of the story was made better then before, the gameplay and overall mission segments kept me interested in the story enough for me to finnish it and like it.The multiplayer is just COD usual multiplayer. Yes I liked it WHEN it came out when everyone was trying out new stuff and the time to kill was slower then now when everyone is running around with smg's just like every other cod. Nothing new to look for here. War is not as bad but it still feels like a capture the flag type of gameplay with segments.Zombies. Well yeah I played for about 6 rounds in general and with that time played I liked it. It's, dare I say, scarier then usual and brings a bit of a horror factor to the game.Overall:The game is OK, it's not worth 60€ and the season pass is overrated. I would give it a 6/10, BUT would not recommend it at a full price. It is better then previous cods (talking from cod ghosts forward), but still needs to have work done."

												Members of Sledgehammer,I'm a faithful fans of Call of Duty series , and I like WW2 very much, bothe the campaign and the multiplayer! Especially the kill sound effect of PC version, it's the best! Everytime I hear that sound I got excited as I kill the enemies, so do my friends. So please! Make this sound effect back! Maybe some players don't like it, but you can make it optional in the settings, so you can satisfy all the players. I sincerely make this request because I love this sound effect!

Slows down the gameplay to much. Multiplayer i find funThere are plenty of game modes and map to choose from and alot of things to unlock.New missions everyday and week.

												If you are planning on getting this for multiplayer, don't. This game is plagued with hackers. I played a bit during launch week and only got into a handful of matches with hackers. After taking some time off, I decided to play WWII this weekend... 3 out of 5 matches were overrun by hackers. I am talking multiple aimbots in a single match. It has become absolutely ridiculous.There is no point in dedicating time to hone your combat skills when some jabroni is just going to aimbot you out of existence.It does have split screen, but unless you are planning on playing a private match, it is still unenjoyable. You'll just be two targets for the aimbot, rather than the one.Decent campaign, but nothing to write home about. It was pretty predictable, and a bit historically inaccurate."

I haven't encountered a lot of the glitches that other players are reporting, so I can't speak about that, but from a pure gameplay standpoint it's really solid. If you're unsure about it, I'd say get it and try it for under 2 hours so that you can get a refund if you don't like it, and if you do like it just keep it!"

												Don't buy, it doesn't even matter if the game is okay.TL;DR: There are multiple, random causes for online profile corruption, and after that the game won't play. You can't fix it, you can't get a new profile, and support is not good about resetting it.I'm totally dissatisfied, my friends are too. I bought the game together with 4 friends, and hours after we all had the tremendous download, online play was down. The servers were down for over a day during the DoubleXP Thanksgiving weekend. We played about 35 public matches before the game broke and none of could play online anymore. There was a glitch in public online play, and I assume that this effected at least 10 people, but I know it broke the game completely for the five of us.We joined a match and something was obviously glitched -- we were in third-person view, which never happens during a match, and there were white backpacks littered all over the ground, which we inevitably picked up and could throw, but everyone was confused and then the match -- which probably lasted 90 seconds -- disconnected and our profiles were corrupted. I now had over 2 billion unlock tokens and prestige level over 150 million and the menu was stuck on the ""Find Match"" screen. I uninstalled and reinstalled the game -- that didn't fix it. Before this incident, the game played flawlessly on all 5 of our PC's. Now the game is broken on all 5 of our machines with the same symptoms.We all talked to Activision support, and there was nothing the support reps we were able to contact could do. I couldn't talk to anyone who could actually handle my case, and they couldn't talk to anyone on my behalf. To be clear, we were put into a support queue and I have no idea when they will actually fix it, even though we talked to about 8 support reps for various reasons. They couldn't find some of us in the system, the chat with the reps got disconnected, they didn't understand the issue, but in the end it was clear that these reps weren't given the capability of doing anything anyway. And they could just reset our profiles, it seems like a quick fix, but they don't have a good support mechanism."

												Lots of people who recommend this game are either trolls or bandwagoner of hate. This game is not as good as the old cod like bo1 or mw2, but it's an improvement and way better than all the futuristic cod. It's also fun af if you have friends to play withStory Mode: It's really amazing. It took me 6 hours to beat it if you take your time and the characters  are good that you feel how they feel in this era. I think Cod campaign are always great and this is one may not be the best, but this one is good as well if you enjoy michael bay action movies and linear games.Multiplayer:At first, i hated it but that's because I suck at the game and I turn on vsync by accident which make my mouse choppy. So make sure to turn that shiz off. Multiplayer is fun and the maps are great. The only map i have is the canon one imho. Overall this is an improvement from advanced warfare and its back on boots on the ground. Also the gun sounds great.Also the headquarters mode in this game is amazing and it's just like destiny if you into that. Supply drop is okay and good for now and hope they keep it cosmetic. Also, this game has tons of customization.Zombie:Zombie is amazing here. Sledgehammer did a good job adapting to the zombie formula and improve on it. Also it's tons of fun and recommend getting this game if you love zombies. Probably my only con is there is only one map.Graphic:The trolls who said this game looks trash are blind because this game is beautiful than any other COD. I have a gtx 1060 3gb model and it runs over 100 fps consitently on ultra settings.This game is also well optimized and I have no performance issues at all.Try out the game since steam has a refund policy and if you don't like it, then refund it. It's well worth my 60 bucks :)"

												ive played through the whole Campaign for 5 hours straight and i was not disapointed with it. Some parts of the game could have been made better like the plane mission, the controls were simply just not there it felt like it was flying itself for the most part it was stiff.

												If you've played csgo for a long time and fallen back from it this is the review for you...I played Destiny 2 when it came out and it was trash.I had low expectations for this game and was only buying it for the multiplayer.A friend bought this for me and here is my review so far.Most of the negative reviews are not true. I have not gotten any network issues so far only when it qued for somewhere farther away after it couldn't find a game. Barely seen any bugs and if I have it's that the ui glitches. This can be fixed by restarting the game (only happened once to me). The leveling up and progression is very nice and I don't have to grind to unlock weapons. Supply drops are only cosmetic and I hope they stay that way. Some weapon variants look nice in the picture but are just the normal weapon but rusty *cough* machine pistol *cough* PLEASE FIX. Sniping is very satisfying and could be considered op, but at close range they don't stand a chance. Some weapons are op and overused but it will get fixed after a while. I bought this game because there are no other games I feel like playing and if I'm bored you best know I'm loading up some WW2 with netflix on the side. If you are bored like me get this game and have some good fun. (stop complaining that the servers are garbage when your internet is actually the culprit)"

												I would reccomend this game to old school COD players as it has some good old aspects, it's just not for me.1. Too many frustrating aspects, e.g. getting stuck on things, grenades rolling through solid objects and killing you.   2. It feels rushed and not polished.3. Maps are tiny and you get to know all of them after a few hours play.4. Hackers already.  I may come back to it sometime but after hitting level 40, thats enough for me.  I have better games to play that don't have me shouting at something that has nothing to do with my skill."

												Yes, this game is censored in multiplayer, and it is not 100% historically accurate.  For all of you ignorant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s claiming that this game is terrible because of the non-existance of swastikas in multiplayer and some of the historical flaws in singleplayer, you must realize that this is a ♥♥♥♥ing GAME!  You are playing it to enjoy yourself and have fun.  Most of you guys out there giving negative ratings are probably just doing it because you already were skeptical due to it being a Call of Duty game, and you would never give it a chance.  This game is one of the most enjoyable Call of Duty games I have ever played, especially since the release of things like Advanced Warfare and other such games.  I reccomend that if you already rated this game negatively, play for another good 20 hours, maybe with a friend for extra enjoyment, and then go back for your review, maybe this time while playing, pay attention to the other aspects that a game should be good in.  It's mechanics are amazing, and I have found no bugs yet surprisingly.

												If you've played csgo for a long time and fallen back from it this is the review for you...I played Destiny 2 when it came out and it was trash.I had low expectations for this game and was only buying it for the multiplayer.A friend bought this for me and here is my review so far.Most of the negative reviews are not true. I have not gotten any network issues so far only when it qued for somewhere farther away after it couldn't find a game. Barely seen any bugs and if I have it's that the ui glitches. This can be fixed by restarting the game (only happened once to me). The leveling up and progression is very nice and I don't have to grind to unlock weapons. Supply drops are only cosmetic and I hope they stay that way. Some weapon variants look nice in the picture but are just the normal weapon but rusty *cough* machine pistol *cough* PLEASE FIX. Sniping is very satisfying and could be considered op, but at close range they don't stand a chance. Some weapons are op and overused but it will get fixed after a while. I bought this game because there are no other games I feel like playing and if I'm bored you best know I'm loading up some WW2 with netflix on the side. If you are bored like me get this game and have some good fun. (stop complaining that the servers are garbage when your internet is actually the culprit)"

												To be honest I do like the game it is fun, Not as good as what I was expecting but still enjoyable to play.To be fair I pre-ordered this game the same day as my xbox one x. About a day or two before my xbox x arrived I just purchased the game here on steam for some reason and got stuck in too playing the game till my xbox x was delivered. I started first by trying it on my og xbox one and my life no one should have to see the pi$$ poor graphics that I was  welcomed with it was like my eyes had gone to hell and back... Then I loaded the game on to my new xbox one x and there was such a difference in performance and resolution that I was really impressed. Over the next few days I went from xbox to pc version and vice versa and I started to notice how the xbox version had really bad shadows and checkerboard rendering that did catch the eye more than what I would have liked aswell as some other rendering technique that applies lines in places that do stand out compaired to the pc version. After this I came to a conclusion that was.... I would rather have this game on my pc than having to watch pi$$ poor graphics on a watered down pc aka the xbox.The story is ok and yes there are points to be made about historical inacrruracies but one most remember that it is just a game and I dont think making a computer game get too virtual that in reality you was standing there with a real gun experiencing the real situation. The true point of entertainment is for some one to enjoy there time with an activity and have fun while doing so. This is the key factor when entertainment is concerned. And did I have fun YES it is a good game same old call of duty style gameplay but still good fun.Multiplayer is a battlefield 1 rip off (thats got to be said) but it does this with pride and honour lol :) Its ok but overall graphics could have been a bit better and the game modes like war are not bad I dont find myself getting board. I do have fun with the multiplayer side of this game also there is more players online than I expected to see. Overall not bad.Compaired to other call of duty games over the last few years I really enjoyed infinite warfare great graphics and gameplay and as the last futuristic shooter for now was my best game at the time more than black ops1/2/3. WW2 Is good but I do think it could have been better if the makers/dev's have used more new ideas than just copy and paste the same old style of call of duty game play and story style.I do recommend buying this game main reason is because its the best port for overall experience in graphics compaired to console versions.All in all not a bad game.Cheer's and peace too all."

												Campaign good.The campaign has a great story line with a mix of stealth and action. Having got pulled into it so much i played it all in 1 sitting, i would have to rate the campaign a 10/10. I ♥♥♥♥ing loved it. (My opinion)Multiplayer good but riddled with cheaters that ruin the experience.As of yet, they havent abused the supply drop system to milk players of their cash. And it isnt impossible to get supply drops with the orders and random selection at the end of the games. The gun balancing is meh. Guns such as the STG and BAR are overused however i wouldnt say overpowered, just extremely easy to use. The trench knife and other melee weapons are great fun to use and in my opinion are well balanced in comparison to each other.I think the War game mode is great (bar the cheaters) its good if you dont want to further bury your K/D by playing game modes such as TDM. Overall Multiplayer is what i have 90 hours on already, so its safe to say i enjoy it. Overall the Multiplayer is just sexual (again apart from the cheaters) due to the ease of access to DLC weapons, the new gamemode War and just the overall play experience of it all.Zombies is ♥♥♥♥ing jumpscary. But gooood. However i havent played it nearly as much as the Campaign or Multiplayer so i cant comment much."

												Huh, where should I start.It's mediocre. For me the story was meeting the standards of other COD storylines, maybe more on the emotional side, but that was expected since it is a WW2 game. Despite that fact, the stealth part of the story was made better then before, the gameplay and overall mission segments kept me interested in the story enough for me to finnish it and like it.The multiplayer is just COD usual multiplayer. Yes I liked it WHEN it came out when everyone was trying out new stuff and the time to kill was slower then now when everyone is running around with smg's just like every other cod. Nothing new to look for here. War is not as bad but it still feels like a capture the flag type of gameplay with segments.Zombies. Well yeah I played for about 6 rounds in general and with that time played I liked it. It's, dare I say, scarier then usual and brings a bit of a horror factor to the game.Overall:The game is OK, it's not worth 60€ and the season pass is overrated. I would give it a 6/10, BUT would not recommend it at a full price. It is better then previous cods (talking from cod ghosts forward), but still needs to have work done."

												Unlike other people there I'm not going to write a review based only on the multiplayer experience, since I bought this game mostly for the singleplayer; well it was worth it's price, this is problably one of the best COD ever made.There's absolutely nothing negative to say about the campaign it feels like watching one of those blockbuster WW2 movies or even being there in the battlefield; this is the game you're searching for if you want a really deep story and a great gameplay. If I can give an honest opinion this product doesn't deserve at all those negative reviews, people always ignore the singleplayer part of COD games, writing reviews only about the multiplayer and complaining that they're full of cheaters. I know that's annoying; I've tried to play a few matches online as well and of course my match had 2 aimbot users, however I still appreciate the work Sledgehammer did to make another good Call of Duty like the first ones and the Modern Warfare series. I hope this review is somehow useful to someone, have a nice day and enjoy the game."

												Bored of overly complicated games with boring and unrewarding tactics, complicated gameplay, and the feeling of not being rewarded enough? If yes, this game is perfect for you! otherwise no, don't even dare to touch this game because it is very simple to play and anyone looking for coordinated teamplay is going to be dissapointed. Literally you can easily get a 10 killstreak with a melee weapon in just one building because no one informs each other of the location of other people. But this is not a bad thing because it makes the game into a fun arcade shooter. It is nowhere as good as the older cod games but if you are looking for a modern, chill game then you should get this. This is only the review of the multiplayer but the zombies mode is fun to play and it has some fun puzzles. Also the campaing is entertaining and basically like a michael bay movie (the story is mediocre). I'd give it a 7.5/10"

I really loved this game overall, the nazi zombies are also excellent. i would appreciate just some more hours of playing but i understand, we cant have it all.last message to the community, stop hacking you are annoying. this game is like one of the best ive played and im really looking to play the multiplayer side as well (you might be thinking""oh you gonna change your review after playing MPLayer'' but no i wont :)"

												One of the first COD games other than BO3 in the past couple years that I have really enjoyed. It overall feels good and my biggest complaint is that sometimes the lobbies I get into have really, really bad hit detection. A few hackers here and there, but typically they are aimbotters/autoheadshot so it is very frustrating but doesn't make the match unplayable until the end when you can leave. Other than that, fun game and one of the better CoDs we have seen in a while!"

												The story is cool, I like the scenery of the place and how is different from the others. The zombies mode is also fun but the map just doesn't have much to offer. I like how there is secret characters you can unlock but it sucks since you need 4 players to complete some parts of the challenge.Not much weapons the game to choose from.  The multiplayer is fun, very fast paced, some of the maps suck, but at least they look good. You are a sponge in the game lot's of hitmarkers, and there is a problem with the party system where you or your friends can't join like 90% of the time so I'm still waiting for that to be patched. The multiplayer got boring very fast and I think that's gonna kill the player base."

												What a disappointment this game is - I am a sucker for COD games and have owned and played all of their titles prior to this.I don't know that I can put my finger on what's wrong with it - it feels wooden, the maps are very small, the scenery is non destructible, and in essence it feels like a game from 10 years ago. I also have Battlefield 1 and there is simply no comparison between the two. Battlefield 1 although it's been out for over a year knocks the socks of this. Frankly the games of Verdun and Tannenburg, produced by a much smaller studio give you more satisfaction than this.The weapon sounds are not at all realistic - I have fired some of them in real life and the game guns bear no comparison with their real life counterparts.Overall I have wasted my money on this game and have now deleted it from my list.If you want a small map, non realistic shooter that at times feels like a rail shooter, then by all means get this - however if you are after something with long term playability and superb maps and atmosphere then avoid this like the plague.Not recommended at all."

They are the types of weebs who wine and ♥♥♥♥♥ every time a new call of duty or battlefield title comes out. Those reviews will get buried eventually. The game may have a few bugs, but if you take a look at the recent updates, they are working on fixing the issues. Oh, for anyone saying this game is not historically accurate, I think you should honestly think about the stupidity you spew out of your mouth. This is a ♥♥♥♥ing video game, not a documentary, get over it. Anyways, if you actually want to get this game, just ask yourself one question: ""Do I want to spend countless hours shooting people in close to mid range combat while feeling like I'm in WWII?""If not, then move on, and if you are looking for realism, go play a different game, this is call of duty for gods sakes."

												Personally i think this is a good game. the campain is fun, i like that there is no auto hp regen. and when playing on the harder difficulties it actually gets really fun. yes some things are not 100% accurate but you dont buy a cod game for its realism.The multiplayer is fun and really easy to get into. my main issu with the mp is that i feel like everyone can tank bullets.The War gamemode is by far the best. you can get so many kills in just one half of the war games. and people actually do play the objective wich i like.The zombies is by far one of the best ones in my oppinion. the zombies just look damn good and it is really fun to play. the Ester Egg feels nice to complete and i like that it has a guided one and a hardcore one you could say. But yes you can say it all goes to personal opinions aswell. But personally i really like tha game. i have sunk some time into it. And i know for sure i will play it a lot more.i have not gotten any problems with the game. i always have over 120 fps and it feels smooth. and my pc does not really have the newest you can say. But this can be diffrent from pc to pc aswell."

												TLDR: Good Single player (a bit short) Multiplayer untested but heard bad things about cheat protection not implemented well.I ONLY bought this for the single player campaign  and even then it was only because of the WW2 theme.With the graphics Maxed out @1440p and no over sampling the game and especially the cutscenes look amaxing.The main game so far is great, missions are a bit short but have re-play value.Graphic Cutscenes are exceptional, as are the details on the in game characters and locationsMain gripes I have are;1) The bullets act a bit like pellets with multiple hits required to take down enemies (unless you heart or head shoot them), but this varies per gun, so not really a biggie.2)Your Allies in the game either do nothing or the enemy AI ignores them and it end up feeling like you have to take on the whole German nation yourself.Worst gripe I have is the QTE's.  WHY have them? they turn what I presume was meant to be an immervise experience into a drudgefest if you get it wrong as the required pressed keysand the mouse movements change every time.Thankfully they are not everywhere, but, would rather have an option to turn them off.I cannot speak about the Multiplayer as I have not and probably never will play it"

												There’re a lot of people bashing this game and being overly critical on things about this game that are found in other great shooters simply because it’s cod. The social hub is awesome for starters, definitely a nice change to the multiplayer. The new war game mode is awesome and is a campaign style objective based mode. The games overall optimization is awesome even the 1050Ti can get up and boogie . Of course my 1070 paired with a 6700k runs this game with FPS over 100-130. I highly recommend this game.

												The campaign for this game feels short, but there is a little more variety when it comes to some sequences in the levels, (i.e. nazi infiltration using a choice mechanic, saving a little girl from behind enemy lines.), and the new squad features they added into the gameplay felt nice and seemless, like they should've been there all along. Although there are still quick time events. Lots and LOTS of quick time events. So be careful of that. Anyway, the characters I felt were well portrayed, and dialouge was believable. But I feel like there should've been more moments for your character and other members of your squad to bond, as you tend to spend time talking to some more than others. Sound-wise, there were sometimes when the dialouge did cut out at the very end of a sentence, so I wouldn't get the last word a character would say sometimes, but there were minimal bugs and glitches other than that, and almost no lag. And by almost, I mean it was still there, but not often at all. I also REALLY enjoyed the setpieces in this game, they felt a lot grander than the ones in Infinite Warfare. ESPECIALLY the train, that one will definetley stick around with me for awhile. Some gripes I did have with the campaign were the fact that nazi's and reich soliders were using guns such as the PP-SH? A russian sub-machine gun? I don't know what kind of research sledgehammer did for this campaign, but I would love to check whatever sources they got their information from on the subject of THAT. On the subject of the swastika not really being portrayed that well in the game by the publishers, I felt that, while a serious historical innaccuracy, it did not affect the gameplay, so I didn't mind it much. But it definitley brings up a ""war-torn"" discussion (at this point) of censorship in video games, and that's a topic I don't really feel like talking about. Another gripe I had about this game was that the main characters internal conflict wasn't meshed out really well. Sure it popped up here and there, but by the end of the game, your supposed to have this moment where your past meets your present in the epilouge, and while I felt that sure, it was very weak, and I felt it could've been implemented better. I did have another major gripe with this campaign until I sat and thought about it for a moment. There was really no central antagonistic character other than some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in your squad. No central villain to defeat like there have been in previous cod games. After the weak attempt infinity ward made in last years game to make Jon Snow's villain the next Kevin Spacey (even though he had MAYBE fifteen minutes of screen time). So I was really looking forward to there being some kind of evil nazi general for us to face off against throughout the campaign and ultimatley defeat victoriously at the end. And there wasn't really one. Until I realized that the whole nazi regime was the main villain. They were all bad guys, some badder than others, but we were all fighting the same war and the same enemy, there were no standouts. There were no Makarovs, no Shepards, no Raul Menedez's, no Kevin Spacey's for that matter, but I felt like that was the point. Because the Nazi's was this big, huge force, this big blob of hatred that we just had to cut down one soldier at a time. All of them were the same, and I think that really speaks to the spirit of what the war was about. That, or there just really weren't any historically signifcant nazi characters they felt during this time period. But to each his own. The multiplayer is same old, same old for the most part. The only thing is, the maps are smaller (expect in war, but even then they feel a little too cramped), there aren't that many guns (for historical reasons, though, this makes sense), and there are still a LOT of aim-botters. It has its flaws, most definetley, but it can still be some fun. Also, lootboxes. I don't know if they're ""pay to win"" yet, but that is a major flaw that will probably unfortunatley never be fixed. I don't have much to say about zombies because for I tried for half an hour and couldn't get a solid match with three other people in it. From what I did play though, with usually only one other person, its a much more grounded in realtiy, gritty, harsher and more terrifying experience. Not for the faint of heart. In conclusion, s'aight."

												I bought this game having stopped playing Cod largely due to the direction the games were taking, however I am surprised with this game in several ways.  First the annoying stuff, the game is overpriced as hell but that's usual for Cod at this point, of course I could spend hours talking about historical accuracy problems with the game, for example Russian Ppsh's on Normandy (although some German units did equip captured Ppsh's none of those units were on the Western Front) however when I bought this game I knew I was in for a cartoon simulator for WW2 not a historical game or realistic game.  In this reguard the game is effective it is essentially a normal Cod game with a theme of WW2 in the background, sue them for bad marketing but I knew it was a Cod game so I expected some over the top marketing.  Essentially treat this game as if it's a Cod Ghosts or Black Ops game where the only guns are from the WW2 era and the maps are only European themed, don't buy this game expecting anything more then that and you might be surprised how much fun you can have."

												I've been a long time fan of Call of Duty and the WWII era.  Some of my greatest gaming moments in Call of Duty are from the hours I'd play in CoD1 and United  Offensive (the expansion pack), CoD2, even CoD3 and World at War (a definite favorite of mine). It's been a long time dream of mine for them to come  back to this WWII setting and it's exciting to see that they have done so with the powerful modern technology at hand these days. I just completed the SP campaign so here are my thoughts.The game itself started off a bit rocky for my tastes. I wasn't too impressed with a lot of the artistic licensing they took for this. I can't say  I was totally shocked since I wasn't expecting anything less than hollywood-levels of ""realism"" and ""authenticity"" since this IS a Call of Duty game after all. I feel like a lot of the reviews from people are mainly just out of spite because of how run of the mill CoD has become and although that's some what fair, it doesn't totally serve this game justice. German soldiers lacked any real variety that it felt like I was mowing down a sea of grey at any given moment. They also fit some sort of game archetype: You had anyone in longcoats with purely rifles,  anyone with caps purely with the SMGs, a crazy shotgun variant with shells draped over their shoulders like vietnam, a soldier with foliage in his helmet toting an MG either by the hip or emplaced. Each variant I spoke of stuck solely to this role. It was extremely gamey and honestly felt childish. It's World War II. It was advertised as  authentic and gritty and I expected a little more down to earth reality in this game because of the way they built it up. Strange weapon additions in this game that really made no sense. PPSH's in large quantities on the Western Front? D-Day? give me  a break. SVT40's instead of G43's? Why? The G43 would have been more tolerable in this game regardless of where it would be seen but it's nonexistent all together (probably going to come from a DLC pack or  something I'm sure). Uniforms of the Germans are a simplified Grey 90 percent of the time that it felt like they were toy soldiers (good guys are green, bad guys are grey). Another childish rendition. They are also extremely bright and appear to almost glow that you can't miss them. They stick out even in dark buildings so i'm sure  that was a video game addition they did for easier gameplay. The Campaign is short. As you can see it took just under 6 hours to complete, it's  about 10-12 chapters long. About average for CoD these days sadly. What happens then is that you're getting a very  streamlined timeline of events from the invasion of Europe to the Rhine. I found each level  getting progressively more interesting as the game went on and you'll have moments that throw you into a tank or the pilot seat of a fighter plane to mix it up a bit. What happens is that you kinda get a bare minimum sense of grand scale. However, each exciting experience is shortlived since the timeline continues to progress and you only get snap shot moments of living history before you're forced to move onto the next hollywood battle. This problem probably derives from trying to encompass so much all at once. Maybe they should have focused on a longer campaign and start adding some more filler to help the progression feel less jarring. Some of the best moments come from working with the French Resistance. Definitely missed potential! Either way, each mission is pretty fun and exciting despite being so short.Sound work was a bit disappointing. Coming from playing BF1 where every weapon sounded real and felt powerful and loaded with real PUNCH, CoD is  about fast paced, high speed low drag  type of gameplay. I would think getting grounded in WWII would mean taking a step back from that approach since CoD4-Infinite Warfare but what did I really expect? Weapons just don't sound believable to their real life counterpart. Though I do like the Garand and K98. Maybe someone will mod the MG42 to sound like the terrifying 'buzzsaw' it really was. Acceptable sound work I guess but I hoped it'd be louder in general. The characters are  actually interesting given the amount of time you have with them (it's short of course). They were all well acted, well animated and this all meant they were believably human. Sure, they all fit their own character archetypes: Guy with glasses is smart and went to college, there's the 'veteran', the wise cracking rabble-rouser who happens to also be Jewish, the Grizzled Sergeant who accepts  nothing less than death, the stoic Lieutenant and of course then there's the main character, Daniels. The all around good guy/hero.  Some of the story as it unfolded seemed to take some beats from the movie Platoon even. The short time you get  to spend playing this game and interacting with these characters actually let me care somewhat for them compared to other CoD titles honestly. Though, due to how short it all was, some of the dramatic moments weren't as powerful as they could have been. Graphically speaking, the game is phenomenal. As I initially said, I was waiting for the day to see WWII captured in modern glory. This game doesn't disappoint in that regard. D-Day was visually impressive and quite the experience on its own. the Battle of the Bulge has to be  my favorite for just how awesome it looked. Probably the one moment I know for sure that sucked me into the immersion of it all. Soldiers will lose limbs from explosions, become bloodied when shot and  you'll probably get a terrifying sense of beauty in it all if you take a moment to admire the graphic works when you fight through the countryside, urban cities, muddy forests, frozen tree lines etc.As a whole, Call of Duty WWII is a welcome reprieve from the modern and  future eras. Don't go in thinking that for some reason Call of Duty is going to drop it's modus operandi and suddenly become an all immersing, sim shooter set  in World War II. Expect the usual Hollywood levels of 'in the  thick of  it' and how there's  enough artistic licensing to say 'yes this is definitely world war II and they might have or could have used/looked like that'.  I think a little more attention to detail would have saved a lot of peeves from this game but it's a competent shooter. I didn't experience crashes or errors. I  didn't have glitches that ruined my experience. It was a straight forward experience and I was having fun as I played. If only one day they'll decide to make a justifiable campaign in length and storytelling, maybe then we'll get the WWII game we've always wanted. Until then, get ready to experience a fast paced, hollywood drama set  in World War II. At  least Call of Duty can still dazzle in spectacle, right?I recommend giving this game a shot. Maybe not at 60 bucks if you only want dip into the Campaign for 6  hours. It's definitely not as bad as some of these people claim it to be and you should know Call of Duty by now so you can't be totally blindsided in expectations. That'll be on you if you are."

												The multiplayer is generally good but it could use more of everything.But the campaign...is a war crime in itself. Not what's in the game, THE GAME. Within the first 4 missions there are 4-5 ""finding sniper and sniping scenes"" and plus it runs horribly. I have multiplayer graphics on full and I run 60fps but I have everything on low for campaign and run 20 with lag spikes.

												This game was good for a little while but then it small things began to bother me, then everything started to bother me. There was much hype following and post game but for its price I feel like there are way better game and buying a retro cod would be more worth your money than this crap. It lacks detail that is the standard expectation for tripple a titles now and days and feels really slacked on. COD had a good reputation but it just feels like they aren't trying anymore with their games. Good thing  I didn't get the season pass because at its price it isn't worth it. Theres few poorly made maps like 11 maps in total which is unacceptable these days as far as content and a decent zombies thats immersive but only good for about 5 hours then its boring. I miss when there was detail, acradey, fun filled moments BO had and MW. Those games if you released them today would be on par with other games, maybe even better. Someone needs to buy COD fire everyone and start out new or beg the people that made this frachise great back."

												I really dont know yet. Apart from some lame QTE's (we really should be spared frome those in this day an age) the game itself feels ok. The sound is ok, I guess. Its hard to tell sometimes cos of the incredible stupid decission to make the ingame music non optional. My ears is constantly being assaulted by some pompous score of drums and brass orcestra. Please stop it already, please. From my perspective, the sound could be more ritch, if that make any sense. It feels a bit flat. Its like listening to a recording, Im not there, so to speak. Tech wise I have had no problems at all. I understand many have had some tech probs but I am not one of them. I have had no problems remapping the keys to my likings, and im an old guy so i still use the arrows keys to move, so cudos for that. I will give a BIG minus for having HITMARKERS! In a singleplayer game!?. Thats a big no no for me. And speaking of dumb executive decission; Not beeing able to adjust things like mouse speed or remapping keys ingame, jeez. I have to quit the game, remap or adjust whatever, then start again. A minor thing perhaps, but still... Action. Well, absolutly nothing new here. I will remind you, iv only played the first hour so things may change. What i can tell you though, is that the landing at Normandy was a bit on the underwelming side. A lot of screaming about moving forward, some really puny explosion around you and a lot of mg fire. The thing is, I never felt in danger. Just run over here, run over there and i will be fine. I can tell you, there is absolutly no Saving Private Ryan beach landing feel here at all. The battle of the farmhouse and artillery gun is equally underwelming. Its over in, what? 2-3 minutes? If that. The counterattack is just as lame. Wy did the germans just stop at that wall? I dont get it. Oh! now I know wy. It so you could reload that MG42, thats wy.What iv seen so far, there is nothing that backs up the claim that this game will revitalize the Call of Duty brand. Its not a bad game, as far as i can tell. It just seems like its not a perticular good game either. Its more like; meh. Been there, done that. To quote a more famous man than myselfe; Ar you not entertained? Well, NO."

												Typical Call of Duty control freaks who think they are film directors, when all they can do is make stereotypical trash. Every single hammy cut scene we are forced to sit through, covering every single stereotype of World War 2. It is painful to watch. The gameplay on the other hand, aside from the serious control issues Sledgehammer Games is renowned for; the gameplay is excellent. It's just such a shame they can't let go of there pathetic desires to be a film director. Sure they can do cinematics, but the story, and the characters are attrocious. Pierson should be the Leutenant, Turner should be the Sergeant, but they went for a stupid role reversal. which completely fails. It's the officer that kills men, and the Sergeants that try to stop them. If it wasn't for the gameplay, it'd be a completely fail. As for multiplayer, servers are crap, always down. Do I recommend this? NO."

												I played tons of COD 1 and 2. I stopped playing when they switched to modern warfare so I was very excited to see the return to World War II. I'm missing a lot of the things that used to make this game great though. First of all the weapons need to be unlocked.Which means you are spending a large time playing against people with a lot better gear. Secondly there is almost no variety in the multiplayer maps. They are all about the same size and games only go up to 12 people. There used to be a lot of different sized maps which also gave you the opportunity to snipe. Almost everyone is playing woth machinegun now due to the short-distance combat. Only rarely do you see someone using a sniper or rifle which made the first COD games so great. In general 75% of the times you get killed online is because someone sideraped you and you only have .5 seconds before they spray kills you. And worst of all, you pay 60 euro's for a game and still there is the hassle with season passes and new content. If you are someone looking for the same as what you loved in COD 1 and 2, don't buy this game."

The multiplayer is fun, very fast paced, some of the maps suck, but at least they look good. You are a sponge in the game lot's of hitmarkers, and there is a problem with the party system where you or your friends can't join like 90% of the time so I'm still waiting for that to be patched.

												What a disappointment this game is - I am a sucker for COD games and have owned and played all of their titles prior to this.I don't know that I can put my finger on what's wrong with it - it feels wooden, the maps are very small, the scenery is non destructible, and in essence it feels like a game from 10 years ago. I also have Battlefield 1 and there is simply no comparison between the two. Battlefield 1 although it's been out for over a year knocks the socks of this. Frankly the games of Verdun and Tannenburg, produced by a much smaller studio give you more satisfaction than this.The weapon sounds are not at all realistic - I have fired some of them in real life and the game guns bear no comparison with their real life counterparts.Overall I have wasted my money on this game and have now deleted it from my list.If you want a small map, non realistic shooter that at times feels like a rail shooter, then by all means get this - however if you are after something with long term playability and superb maps and atmosphere then avoid this like the plague.Not recommended at all."

												Before I begin this review I just want to preface that I am mostly going to be focusing on gameplay rather than historical accuracy as that has been talked about to death at this point. Also, I have not beat the campaign so I will not give my opinion on it so far, even though it seems decent so far.-Pros * Gunplay feels solid, and kills are satisfying   * Graphics are nice with not much low res textures ( if at all ) * Optimization seems good, Never have I ran below 60 fps ( Running GTX 1060 6GB )  * Multiplayer progression and rewards feel much better in this COD, especially with the new HQ * Zombies is back with new perks, storyline, and abilities that feel fresh * Each Multiplayer play style is now broken up into perks that have their own unique abilities that make playstyles more unique-Cons * Innevitable DLC that will divide the community on PC * Snipers tend to feel like a must pick on some maps * Multiplayer connection has some issues with rubberbanding and latency * Price point of 60 dollars is a bit much ------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall I do feel that this game is fun and definatley worth your time if you are considering playing call of duty again. However, 60 dollars is a bit steep and if that is too costly for you then I would recomend waiting for a sale as this is not a ground breaking game that should cost an investment from your wallet."

												It's just simply not a good game. Everything about it just is extremely mediocre, the only enjoyable part is the opening D-Day sequence in the campaign and zombies is ok. If this game wasn't a WW2 reskin but kept the exact same gameplay feel no one would care. It's nice to see old weapons and the classic sounds of them *PING* again. But beyond that there's nothing special here. The campaign generally falls apart after the D-Day sequence for two reasons. One, Normandy beach is so iconic it's hard to make it unenjoyable. And two, the lack of regenerating health totally breaks the game and it's clear no playtesting went into it. During a dozen sequences you'll be seperated from your medic and since enemies are hitscan with instant reaction time you'll end up dying over and over. But once your medic DOES end up by your side you'll be swimming in medkits and have no problem. But the gameplay still does consist of pop out of cover, shoot enemies, go back into cover and push 6 to heal with a medkit, and repeat. So fundamentally there's no difference in how the game plays beyond being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cheap when you're seperated from your squad.I hope Treyarch does a WWII game, though I doubt they'll follow this up with another of the same time period. I can only maybe reccomend this on a 50% off but by that point I imagine the next CoD will have come out."

												Wow where to start. most of the negative comments are true so no reason to repeat them. Super unbalanced weapons, pistols seem stonger and more accurate than many of the weapons in HC. The game seems riddled with hackers. No ability for people to vote hackers out of a game in progress. The supply drops are glitchy randomly vanish after much hard work earning them.

												THIS REVIEW IS ALMOST COMPLETELY MULTIPLAYER AND ZOMBIES RELATED!!! TIME PLAYED IS ONLY COUNTING THE TIME IN SINGLEPLAYER!!I originally enjoyed this game when it was first released... but I've finally opened my eyes to the fact that it feels just like every other boots on the ground COD, nothing special... The gameplay id fun for about 5 - 10 minutes before you realise that you've experienced all the game has to offer on the Multiplayer front, all of the gamemodes  are the same as they always have been, just with a War gamemode, which I can argue is the best part of the Multiplayer... But even this can get repettetive. There is also hackers in the game already and that is unacceptable for a mainstream AAA game. Also Loot Boxes Galore... mostly cosmetics at this point with a few Weapons WHICH can be unlocked by completing 50 matches for ONE... Not a great way of handling that... As I said earlier on... I first played this game actually enjoying it... but soon found out that there wasn't many differences between this one and some of the older ones... (Go back and play World at War, there is hackers but there is also better servers and mod support for Zombies).I have only played the singleplayer for about 6 minutes to set up controls and graphics settings, but I've played the multiplayer for about 11 hours so I've got enough time under my belt to make a decent review. (Didn't actually play the Campaign as I saw reviews saying it wasn't what was expected and wasn't as authentic as Sledgehammer Games said it would be... Never been interested in a COD Campaign since Black Ops 2...)If you're looking for a historical FPS that is actually authentic, go for Day of Imfamy or Battlefield 1. Both of these games are worth it and don't lock weapons behind loot boxes (Weapon skins are in BF1 though)...Dont waste your money like I did..."

												Let me make it clear that I've only played through the first mission. That's all I needed to be confident that this game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ My primary complaint is a garbage story with contrived relationships that completely♥♥♥♥♥♥on basic story telling principals. The mechanics of the game are poorly thought out and even more poorly executed. To put it simple, it's clunky and the AI makes Homer Simpson look like Captain America. They are ineffective in combat and stood next to a sequenced explosion scene without taking cover or damage. I've played RTS games with bot allies at 95% handicap and they were more useful than the allies in this game.If the contrived quick time sequence was deplorable, what immediately follows is sequence of stunningly bad writing and gameplay execution. Even on their hardest difficulty I was breezing through the mission. The fact that I ripped through a mission on Veteran difficulty is probably why they don't have achievements for beating missions on Veteran difficulty; it wouldn't be an accomplishment. I want my money back. If you want a good COD WWII game, go pick up COD II Big Red One."

												Alright its cod time again this time its back to the basic ww2 style gameplay! or is it? well the single player was fun but short. the multiplayer is bad just bad. its not balanced at all. smg's still rule the school having little to no movement penalty and the airborne class even gets the added benefit of increasing there speed and a added silencer. while the mountain classes (sniper class) gets no radar pickup but no silencer but access to sniper rifles. the infrantry get a bayonet charge with the added bayonet attached to their rifle. really its kinda buggy depending on latency.  then there is armored class which brings a heavy smg to the party that slows your movement to a crawl and makes you easy prey to the airborne class. while they get the added benefit of a bipod it doesn't automatically detache and keeps you from moving. while its a great idea you practically have to camp to get good use out of the class. finally there is Expeditionary class which packs a shotgun which is devistating in close combat its like a pea shooter at anymore than 10 feet or so. they get the 2 added bonus's they can pack a lethal and a tactical gernade into combat. the other bonus is fire rounds for there shotgun only 4 per respawn not even a full reload for the most basic pump action shotgun but i must say its pretty when shot.basically this is just a reskin of there stock cod games. i can not tell you how boring it is to play multiplayer. everyone plays airborne or carries a smg its so pointless to play any other weapon. smg's just grant all positives and no negatives. quick movement more range than the Expeditionary shotguns. they can run circles around both snipers and machinegunners. this will be my last cod purchase till they balance the weapons and the division."

												Typical Call of Duty control freaks who think they are film directors, when all they can do is make stereotypical trash. Every single hammy cut scene we are forced to sit through, covering every single stereotype of World War 2. It is painful to watch. The gameplay on the other hand, aside from the serious control issues Sledgehammer Games is renowned for; the gameplay is excellent. It's just such a shame they can't let go of there pathetic desires to be a film director. Sure they can do cinematics, but the story, and the characters are attrocious. Pierson should be the Leutenant, Turner should be the Sergeant, but they went for a stupid role reversal. which completely fails. It's the officer that kills men, and the Sergeants that try to stop them. If it wasn't for the gameplay, it'd be a completely fail. As for multiplayer, servers are crap, always down.

I honestly don't even have time to notice where it has gone missing. For the most part, it's there, but im sure for the WWII purist, they can spot it.That said, i love the campaign.

Steam has intrduce to the market a defective product and should be held accountable in a court of law. Class Action Law Suit.  It is a buisnees no other than anyone and protects its software with lawsuits for any copy right invingements. Steam however does not protect the user why ? Profit , if they were to advertise to the consumer that they had a deffective product , it would result in a loss of profit, and that the bottom line.So I asking everone who has bought the game only to be physically/mentally injured by the hackers who only want you to ""Want to Rage Quit"" join in this and force Steam to refund our money , remove the game , and give the public awritten staement of they YEARS of failing to control their product. there product teaches our childer its ok to CHEAT to win.Stam/Valve is corrupting our youth with un-moral, and ethical products."

												The game is Okay.. nothing great. You can tell that they were trying to make all the SJWs happy so they put Female soldiers into the game and didnt use swastikas.. But those are just little things.The campaign.. I really like how they added a health bar back into the game.. but the campaign is pretty much just a movie  that you play a little.. they really hold your hand through out the game.Zombies.. Its pretty fun if you've liked zombies.. but the map is kinda small.. which means you can unlock every door in a short amount of time... They also added objectives which are pretty fun and are a challenge..  I just wish the map was bigger or there was another map you could play... and I wish they added the ray gun or some other power weapons beside the tesla gun**UPDATE** This zombies is super easy compared to the older ones.. its super hard to lose.. and once you beat the boss your pretty much done and just have to die if you dont want to keep going.Multiplayer.. Really dissapointed with the multiplayer.. there are barely any maps.. not alot of guns.. and it seems like people take a long time to connect to games.. it always takes a few minutes for the teams to fill up.. **UPDATE** After playing a little more.. it feels like ALL weapons that you have are just like Pea shooters compared to what everyone else has.. it takes so long to get a kill.. and while everyone else kills you in a few shots.. it doesnt seem balanced at all.. and the online community seems really toxicOverall I would recommend the game if you like quick run and gun games..This will probably be the last cod I buy unless they get their stuff together and get rid of this garbage supply drop and actually add content"

												Even though there are tiny negative things that need to be worked on, this game is amazing and has great potentials.However... ""SOMEHOW"", I was absolutely convinced that the moment this game will be released, hundreds of negative reviews will hammer down...Because these days people are constantly b*tching about every single game and always trying to focus on the small negative details to the point that it became really a trend of whining. And now it's really hard to find an online multiplayer game without tons of bad reviews which is harming the game's player base. And eventually, it will lead to less motivation from the developer's side to fix things, since the game will feel dead anyway.You have to grow up and understand that you can't always have everything perfect especially in massive online games, so maybe you just need to fix your way of thinking and focus on having fun instead of aiming at digging as many cons as you can to look like Mr. Angry Rebel.

												Let's start this off with the fact it is almost 2 months after release.Nothing is being done about Blatant cheaters, reports are not being reviewed, the report system does not work, I have played the last week in my favorite game modes. Everyday I came across the same bundle of Cheaters using Aimbot, Wallhacks, and they blatantly admit to it through chat they get 8 kills in a ""play of the game"" cam. Nothing is stopping them, and they know it. I would love to list all the cheaters I have played against but im not about to start a witchhunt.I honestly expected more from a AAA publisher and developer team, especially since they have been doing this type of genre/game for years. Up until the winter siege update PC users had no access to emblem creation, we are still waiting on ""coming soon"" for paintjobs, why is it every developer and publisher lately AAA or not, think its okay to release full priced uncompleted games. I currently experience an occassional ""Sticky Keys"" sort of bug in game where my character will simply slide around as if my keys are stuck when they are not, and it just goes away on its own. I had not purchased a Call Of Duty game since MW3 as I disliked the trend I was witnessing. Now I see why I haven't been buying Call of Duty Games, because they are just being pumped out for sales not actual enjoyable gameplay.TLDR;Game has unchecked Cheaters/hackers, still content that is unaccessible, lootboxes are a thing, still very buggy ~2months into release, Lazy AAA developers and publisher, solutions exist, Do N O T recommend, subject to change if developers and their publisher decide to fix their game sooner than later."

Then i think this new update came and i started to have really bad fps drops constantly. They are like 5-25fps for 2-5seconds and I literaly had no problem playing with 8gb ram before and even if i set the game at medium-high im still getting these fps drops.

												The story is cool, I like the scenery of the place and how is different from the others. The zombies mode is also fun but the map just doesn't have much to offer. I like how there is secret characters you can unlock but it sucks since you need 4 players to complete some parts of the challenge.Not much weapons the game to choose from.  The multiplayer is fun, very fast paced, some of the maps suck, but at least they look good. You are a sponge in the game lot's of hitmarkers, and there is a problem with the party system where you or your friends can't join like 90% of the time so I'm still waiting for that to be patched. The multiplayer got boring very fast and I think that's gonna kill the player base."

												What a disappointment this game is - I am a sucker for COD games and have owned and played all of their titles prior to this.I don't know that I can put my finger on what's wrong with it - it feels wooden, the maps are very small, the scenery is non destructible, and in essence it feels like a game from 10 years ago. I also have Battlefield 1 and there is simply no comparison between the two. Battlefield 1 although it's been out for over a year knocks the socks of this. Frankly the games of Verdun and Tannenburg, produced by a much smaller studio give you more satisfaction than this.The weapon sounds are not at all realistic - I have fired some of them in real life and the game guns bear no comparison with their real life counterparts.Overall I have wasted my money on this game and have now deleted it from my list.If you want a small map, non realistic shooter that at times feels like a rail shooter, then by all means get this - however if you are after something with long term playability and superb maps and atmosphere then avoid this like the plague.Not recommended at all."

												This game was good for a little while but then it small things began to bother me, then everything started to bother me. There was much hype following and post game but for its price I feel like there are way better game and buying a retro cod would be more worth your money than this crap. It lacks detail that is the standard expectation for tripple a titles now and days and feels really slacked on. COD had a good reputation but it just feels like they aren't trying anymore with their games. Good thing  I didn't get the season pass because at its price it isn't worth it. Theres few poorly made maps like 11 maps in total which is unacceptable these days as far as content and a decent zombies thats immersive but only good for about 5 hours then its boring. I miss when there was detail, acradey, fun filled moments BO had and MW. Those games if you released them today would be on par with other games, maybe even better. Someone needs to buy COD fire everyone and start out new or beg the people that made this frachise great back."

												Game no longer has a competitive feel , it's lost its way and now caters for the casual jump in gamer , it used to be a game where everyone was equal , no advantages over anyone .The gameplay was skilful , you could jump in but it took you a while to master the movement plus challenging recoil .. Now in the latest instalment guns have no recoil , movement is slightly dumbed down gun attachments ruin any kind of balance and look awful in game , killstreaks destroy the game , perks ruin the balance .. game looks pretty but other than the multiplayer gameplay is terrible Single player I was hopeful for but everything is a cutscenes and the game should have memorable scenes ... desperate attacks and feelings of actually being there and trying to help keep ""ai"" alive ... not this game however .. poorly scripted .. sounds too bassy ...However it's nice to jump on for 30 minutes when you're bored .. is it worth paying hundred pound for ?

Talking about harh losses, when I heard this game would go back to the roots I expected a very good campaign (which we don't have; it barely fills a day of gaming) and long range maps as the classic MP_pavlov from cod I not just modern warfare type maps with WO II weapons!In short no love lost on this game, not from me but also clearly not from the makers...."

												Where COD:WW2 unsuspectingly shines is it's campaign. Far more touching and impactful than it has any right to be. If you're a fan of something like Band of Brothers, there is really something here for you. There are a few stealth sections that really stand out, balanced out by a few vehicle sections with some atrocious controls and plainly bad combat. Quite a variety on display in general, anchored by incredible cinematics and noteworthy performances from the cast. The multiplayer is more of what you'd expect. Countless encounters with cheaters, or at least those who are so outrageously good that the experience is an exercise in frustration. When it does work however, it's frantic. The leveling system is straight forward and the new Resistance class filled a much needed void for players who like to be quick and sneaky. Overall, you should know what to expect here."

												I really dont know yet. Apart from some lame QTE's (we really should be spared frome those in this day an age) the game itself feels ok. The sound is ok, I guess. Its hard to tell sometimes cos of the incredible stupid decission to make the ingame music non optional. My ears is constantly being assaulted by some pompous score of drums and brass orcestra. Please stop it already, please. From my perspective, the sound could be more ritch, if that make any sense. It feels a bit flat. Its like listening to a recording, Im not there, so to speak. Tech wise I have had no problems at all. I understand many have had some tech probs but I am not one of them. I have had no problems remapping the keys to my likings, and im an old guy so i still use the arrows keys to move, so cudos for that. I will give a BIG minus for having HITMARKERS! In a singleplayer game!?. Thats a big no no for me. And speaking of dumb executive decission; Not beeing able to adjust things like mouse speed or remapping keys ingame, jeez. I have to quit the game, remap or adjust whatever, then start again. A minor thing perhaps, but still... Action. Well, absolutly nothing new here. I will remind you, iv only played the first hour so things may change. What i can tell you though, is that the landing at Normandy was a bit on the underwelming side. A lot of screaming about moving forward, some really puny explosion around you and a lot of mg fire. The thing is, I never felt in danger. Just run over here, run over there and i will be fine. I can tell you, there is absolutly no Saving Private Ryan beach landing feel here at all. The battle of the farmhouse and artillery gun is equally underwelming. Its over in, what? 2-3 minutes? If that. The counterattack is just as lame. Wy did the germans just stop at that wall? I dont get it. Oh! now I know wy. It so you could reload that MG42, thats wy.What iv seen so far, there is nothing that backs up the claim that this game will revitalize the Call of Duty brand. Its not a bad game, as far as i can tell. It just seems like its not a perticular good game either. Its more like; meh. Been there, done that. To quote a more famous man than myselfe; Ar you not entertained? Well, NO."

												After 50 hours of multiplayer and 10 hours of the singleplayer campaign i've came out with this review. Ill start with the campaing.The campaign: The campaign is mediocre not really good but not bad. Basically its run somewhere cutscene and repeating. The squad members are cool but when nazis shoot at you, you're squad mates don't cover you, they are there only for the supplies. One level i really enjoyed (small spolier) was the France one. The game is basically modern Cod or should i say Scripts of duty. And some parts of the game are so scripted its kinda funny. The mementos (Basically some things you can collect during the game) aren't even worth pointing out cause they're not important to the story and really minor, i didn't bothered to collect them during my time. The game is only rushing to the objective and the Germans retreat even though they had the advantage. The main villian of the story is not really intimidating and the main protagonist is pretty good and along the journey you feel the feels that he has. As i said the campaign is mediocre but i've really enjoyed the campaing. Mainly the France mission, that was pretty amazing for me.The multiplayer: Basically Cod multiplayer. What can i say. Maps are small and the gameplay is fast, but thats a good thing for some players. I've bought this game to have fun and it delivers it. Some say they got bored of the multiplayer pretty fast but this isn't for me. i'm rank 41 in time of writting this review and still satisfies me. As you might have guessed the player base is full of toxic players calling you ""Noob"" for using the shotgun or ""Noob team"" when they lose even ""Hacker"" when someone is a better player than him. Yes they are hackers but i've seen only one during my time. The gamemodes are nothing new you got the standart gamemodes like Team deathmatch, capture the flag, free for all, demolition and so on. The war mode is apparently rippof of some gamemode in battlefield 1 but i'm too lazy to look up what it is and i don't play Battlefield, but none the less still fun gamemode. The division you'd figure out but personally mine's favourite is the airbone. You have the normal mode or the hardcore modes, also ranked play. During some times the game includes special events like winter seige that just ended (Basically a christmas/winter event).Nazi zombies: The zombies mode is pretty fun you will fight hordes of nazi zombies and have to complete objectives to reach the end. Its a horde mode that obviously will get more difficult and you go on. You might wanna look at youtube for some of it. The story of it is that an Austrian engineer Marie Fischer is looking for her brother in some town where nazis dug up some artifacts and she hires four people: Jefferson Pots, Drostan Hynd and Olivia Durant. Mine personal favourite is Drostan because he's scottish and i love Scottis people and their accent and he's voiced by David Tennant the guy who played Doctor who. You can play alone or some random people that want to complete the map or some idiots that sit in a corner killing zombies and don't group up, thats why i prefer going alone. I haven't completed the standart map The final reich. It is scary for the first time but when you play it more and more you know what is going to happen.The game has problems mainly in the multiplayer servers but if activision didn't partner with Sledgehammer studios the game would be much worse. In my opinion i think that Sledgehammer will make the game alive for a few years.

												I really do not understand all the hate on this game. In my opinion, this is one of the best COD's that has come out in recent years. The campaign, while quite short, is very enjoyable, and I like most of the characters. I can agree that ""Red"" is very dull, but the energetic personality of Zussman, and the competition between Pierson and Turner pick up what Red brings down. One of the main points that I see on these negative reviews is the lack of historical accuracy in these games. I have to disagree with anyone who says this is the reason the game is below average. Call of Duty has never been exactly historically accurate. There is always a slight twist to make the game more entertaining. And, if you're one of the people that is getting caught up over the fact that the Nazi armbands were left out, or the Nazi's are using Russian guns, then I have to say, were you looking for a Call of Duty game, or a World War 2 simulator? Because, if you're answer is the latter, you have come to the wrong game. Call of Duty is a video game franchise meant to entertain it's audience. It has never been, and will never be, a completely accurate war simulator. I will agree that there are a few bugs and problems with the campaign, like the tank mission. However, if you take a look at the big picture, this campaign was not a disappointment. It was meant to entertain, and it did just that.The multiplayer in this game has by far been the best part. I have always envied the days that I used to spend grinding COD MW2 and Black Ops 1 multiplayers. The grind for guns and the intense game play from these games has been recreated perfectly with COD WW2. The new maps for this multiplayer have been surprisingly good. I was a bit skeptical at first as to what kinds of competitive maps could be added into a WW2 COD, but after playing all of the maps, I am very satisfied. There is a fine balance between short, mid, and long range warfare, which enables people of all play styles to prosper. There are the occasional frustrations, like unreliable servers and the occasional cheater, but these are all problems that a new game has to deal with, and I expect these problems will be handled soon. The Nazi Zombie game mode is very enjoyable, and it's extremely fun to play with a couple of friends. There is not much to complain about here.Finally, I would like to address all the people instantly giving negative reviews because they cannot run the game, or they crash after playing for a few minutes. From the get-go, this game was said to require a beefy computer. People with computers that are below the recommended or even minimum requirements for the game should not buy it. They should instead upgrade their computer or buy the game for console. You cannot blame the game for the lag problems it brings when it specifically warns you about them before it is even released.In conclusion, I think that Call of Duty WW2 is a very good game, and with some minor improvements, can become one of the best COD's of recent years. As of now, I give this game an 8/10."

												What to say that people already havent? well simple its just a bad Call of Duty. The hitboxs are playing cards turned sideways, the weapons take 6 to 10 bullets to kill someone unless you are using a sniper which takes 1 to 3 shots, the ""servers"" are laggy and prone to dropping, your more likely to get spawn killed then actually move, the security system in the game is worse then Counter Strike, the list goes on and on.the only ""redeeming"" feature is that your progress isnt tied to how many loot boxes you get, though certain weapon skin give bonus XP, so thats a plus right guys? Honestly save your money and go buy Battlefront 2, at least that game isn't broken its just has too much loot boxes"

												-=Best Call of Duty in years=-I barely played the last few, for a lot of reasons, such as the inability to unbind the jetpack dash garbage, unmemorable weapons and sounds and poor level design.  This one is a breath of fresh air! -=PROS=--Sounds are ACE, get some nice 7.1 and go to town-Level design, mantling, smooth edges for maps is pretty well done-New system, as much as I enjoyed Pick10 Create A Class, their new approach is pretty good with divisions-Player Prestige doesn't reset weapon progress (I think BO2 & 3 did that) so you can prestige and work on weapons again without losing all progress!-HEADQUARTERS!  I sounds gimmicky but it really does add a nice level to the game.  You can go to the firing range to test attachments, practice with all the scorestreaks for free, 1v1 pit combat with spectators, and interact with other players and show off your gear.  Very cool feature that is much better than it sounded.  (Think Destiny Tower, instead of just a blank lobby waiting screen)-Getting thrown into a match in progress and losing will not negatively effect your statsx|CONS|x-Interface needs help, menus aren't easy to find (must be in this submenu then hit a hotkey to even find this whole menu, ect..)-I'd LOVE if we could FFA with friends and still earn progress, I realize it's an anti-boosting measure, but people will stat pad no matter what, let us kill our friends!-WAR maps seem poorly designed with sometimes down to literally ONE chokepoint-Lots of PC features not present, small Quality of Life like holding backspace when typing, hitting esc and bringing up the menu when the match finishes, skipping end-of-round trophy stage, lots of stuff just feels clunky with menus and interaction, but when you're in a match, it's got everything you'd expect.-Splitscreen is local only, can't let friends come over and frag with me online, which nobody does anymore, but if you're going to advertise local co-op and splitscreen, let us play online like the good ol' days. Current issues:  Servers crashing, end of match about 60% of the time I get ""disconnected from server"" and it boots me from my party and into another match without them.Questions?

												The game is Okay.. nothing great. You can tell that they were trying to make all the SJWs happy so they put Female soldiers into the game and didnt use swastikas.. But those are just little things.The campaign.. I really like how they added a health bar back into the game.. but the campaign is pretty much just a movie  that you play a little.. they really hold your hand through out the game.Zombies.. Its pretty fun if you've liked zombies.. but the map is kinda small.. which means you can unlock every door in a short amount of time... They also added objectives which are pretty fun and are a challenge..  I just wish the map was bigger or there was another map you could play... and I wish they added the ray gun or some other power weapons beside the tesla gun**UPDATE** This zombies is super easy compared to the older ones.. its super hard to lose.. and once you beat the boss your pretty much done and just have to die if you dont want to keep going.Multiplayer.. Really dissapointed with the multiplayer.. there are barely any maps.. not alot of guns.. and it seems like people take a long time to connect to games.. it always takes a few minutes for the teams to fill up.. **UPDATE** After playing a little more.. it feels like ALL weapons that you have are just like Pea shooters compared to what everyone else has.. it takes so long to get a kill.. and while everyone else kills you in a few shots.. it doesnt seem balanced at all.. and the online community seems really toxicOverall I would recommend the game if you like quick run and gun games..This will probably be the last cod I buy unless they get their stuff together and get rid of this garbage supply drop and actually add content"

												I don't understand why local co-op is advertised here when its not even possible. That is very misleading unless it's going to be placed in the game further on which I highly doubt. Also the story mode auto save feature is complete garbage. This is my third attempt at completing the story since my saved data seems to be gone every single time I try to play the campaign. I now have to dedicate a couple hours on the weekend to play the game straight through with no breaks since my data goes missing everytime I try to get back to the campaign at a later date. But this game doesn't sell for the story mode and possibly for some others like me who look forward to games with some local co-op, especially since it's advertised and a feature that was in previous games. The multiplayer is great with the exception of some divisions being superior than the others. Mountain class with my first week experience in multiplayer, people were quick scoping me like they been playing this game for months. Sniping in the game in my opinion, should not be easy to the point that an entire lobby was doing it. I felt like I was playing a custom game of quick scopes only. If all you care about in this game is multiplayer and zombies go right ahead and purchase this game. But if you care about ww2 story mode and the actual history of the event. This game is not for you and good luck with your campaign saved data. I read some other comments and it seems I'm not the only one with this issue."

												When I played the beta day 1, the multiplayer wasn't bad, 2nd day beta was flooded with hackers and was broken.Release day the game was actually running smooth as butter, no hackers as of yet and it's been a couple days, multiplayer is another cod reskinned yet the HQ mode was actually kinda cool. Now for zombies i do enjoy it, it adds more element of horror which i like especially if u are a killing floor fan. Campaign for what ive done so far which is 2 chapters i enjoyed a lot. Longer version still summarizedCampaign:As most COD campaigns they are action based with nice cinematic shorts.  This one is no different.  I will admit it's been some time since I have played a cod campaign and have gotten attached to the main character and this one did it for me.  The drama, action, and gameplay I am enjoying quite a bit. I am not expecting a Super Triple AAA action game but for the little bit this is, it's honestly not that bad. Registry for hits is perfect, i pop an enemy in the head, they die one shot. The slow parts are yes slow, but transition into action quickly and give u a frantic pace that makes u feel you are in the story. (i play with surround  headphones) I don't compare it while playing, i literaly just play for what it is and enjoy it. I don't care to nit pick the historical facts I am just playing it. Zombies: Prev zombie modes I didn't get too involved with because I felt there was too much to learn and find and easter eggs i didn't care too much for. For this years installment, I am enjoying it more because it takes out the ""lets border the windows"" aspect and leaves u vulnerable to the horde of zeds coming forth your way. The variation is alright, but i noticed the more in depth i get, the more variation comes with it. I actually felt the ""classes"" in Zombies was pretty neat each with special powers to help your team out which I like because I felt like it had that very small influence of a RPG. The traps are neat, the setting is definantly there for me. Multiplayer:Well what can I say? It is COD with a boots on the ground approach like the previous installments MW MW2 BO and BO2 with the World War 2 skin. The maps aren't that bad i mean if u like to just run around and shoot but got bored with the old maps, this will be refreshing in a sense that it has new maps, the tesselation is pretty good, lighting isn't bad, and so far I have not encountered cheaters yet. (key word YET) The HQ mode is actually cool, gives you more to do with dailies, challenges, and to meet other players to commend them or just hang out. The collection mode is neat yet like holy crap with the amount of cred u need to complete each set for 1 skin but can be rewarding to players that spend a lot of time in game. The movement is nice, the registry so far is on par, and the sound effects I really like yet the explosions all sound close to the same in each COD game at least to me. I do enjoy the Multiplayer on a casual aspect and like the play of the game kill cam as apposed to the last kill being showcased. All in all, I feel that the game has changed a crap ton since Beta and was actually rooting for the game when I was playing it on launch day. I just hope the countermeasures for cheaters will keep on par and understand there are cheaters in every game, u can't catch all, but at least give a crap about it and try to keep the game from being destroyed. The game overall as a whole, is not that bad, I wish you could seperate the 3 modes in different launchers as apposed to having zombies and multi tied, having to close the game down to switch modes is irritating but not a game breaker. Keep in mind I play all styles of FPS games and have an open mind to it. This is my opinion and not biased in any way. Anywho, i hope this helps a little i do rate this game a 7/10 because it's still the same COD, but with a couple new approaches yet still keeps you wanting ""something else"""

												-=Best Call of Duty in years=-I barely played the last few, for a lot of reasons, such as the inability to unbind the jetpack dash garbage, unmemorable weapons and sounds and poor level design.  This one is a breath of fresh air! -=PROS=--Sounds are ACE, get some nice 7.1 and go to town-Level design, mantling, smooth edges for maps is pretty well done-New system, as much as I enjoyed Pick10 Create A Class, their new approach is pretty good with divisions-Player Prestige doesn't reset weapon progress (I think BO2 & 3 did that) so you can prestige and work on weapons again without losing all progress!-HEADQUARTERS!  I sounds gimmicky but it really does add a nice level to the game.  You can go to the firing range to test attachments, practice with all the scorestreaks for free, 1v1 pit combat with spectators, and interact with other players and show off your gear.  Very cool feature that is much better than it sounded.  (Think Destiny Tower, instead of just a blank lobby waiting screen)-Getting thrown into a match in progress and losing will not negatively effect your statsx|CONS|x-Interface needs help, menus aren't easy to find (must be in this submenu then hit a hotkey to even find this whole menu, ect..)-I'd LOVE if we could FFA with friends and still earn progress, I realize it's an anti-boosting measure, but people will stat pad no matter what, let us kill our friends!-WAR maps seem poorly designed with sometimes down to literally ONE chokepoint-Lots of PC features not present, small Quality of Life like holding backspace when typing, hitting esc and bringing up the menu when the match finishes, skipping end-of-round trophy stage, lots of stuff just feels clunky with menus and interaction, but when you're in a match, it's got everything you'd expect.-Splitscreen is local only, can't let friends come over and frag with me online, which nobody does anymore, but if you're going to advertise local co-op and splitscreen, let us play online like the good ol' days. Current issues:  Servers crashing, end of match about 60% of the time I get ""disconnected from server"" and it boots me from my party and into another match without them.Questions?

												Was great at first. SP was fun for a bit, MP is okay, and nostalgia feeling, but as a whole, this feels like a ""Port"" to PC becasue there are just too many bugs and experienced multiple crashes. I have updated all drivers, settings, and un/reinstall the game twice with on-par and above system. The game is just too buggy to play unless theres a patch soon cause not having to even start the campign from the title screen is just sad, and this is coming from a long-time Call of Duty fan."

												Pretty good game.Let's start with the campaign,it was good but it was not what i expected, i thought it would be something like saving private Ryan but it wasn't so it a 7/10 for the campaign.They could have made it much better.Now,Multiplayer, imo it's pretty fun,maps are cool guns are awesome and the kill streaks don't dissapoint you.If you are an old call of duty fun you will enjoy this game.About supply drops,eh they are ok.Overall,i enjoy this game and there is nothing really wrong with it,expect if you have a problem that there aren't swastikas on multiplayer and having the option to play a female character,if you understand that multiplayer is about having fun then this game's perfect for you."

 A Great Return  First of all, I know it says that I only have 2.1 hours on the game. That's because it's not counting in the 100 hours I have in the online multiplayer mode as it's a separate .exe, which is also what I'm reviewing.  This Call of Duty title is not only a fantastic return to what the franchise used to be, but it simultaneously manages to bring a lot of new content and mechanics to the table WWII brings a bunch of new content to the table with the biggest difference being how you create you classes and customize your soldier. With over 30 weapons in the game I can ensure a great variety in gameplay. Not to mention that they are constantly adding new DLC weapons into the game for  free . Every single gun and melee weapon is obtainable through Major Howard's Orders. They are usually as simple as completing 35 - 50 games. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare  introduced Supply Drops. They rewarded players with better guns which lead to unfair gameplay. WWII solves this issue by making all Supply Drop rewards cosmetic only. It should be notet though that  Epic  and  Heroic  gun variants do grant 10% and 15% XP boosts. Although this only affects the players progress thoughout the game and does not affect gameplay.There are 9 standard maps in WWII, with an additional 3 maps in the new War game mode. Fans of the franchise (including myself) are of course heavily dissapointed with this number.Originally posted by S.E. Doster: Call of Duty: WWII's nine maps aren't nearly enough! As previous COD games normally launch with more standard maps, you can see why people are dissapointed with this. However, the maps are not bad. There's usually one or two maps in a COD game that everyone dislikes, like Modern Warfare 2's Estate map. This game has all good maps with great visual and structural differences.Keep in mind that even though all maps are good, there's not amazing map. They're all just... good.Needless to say, this is a must own Call of Duty title, especially if you are an OG fan."

												Even though there are tiny negative things that need to be worked on, this game is amazing and has great potentials.However... ""SOMEHOW"", I was absolutely convinced that the moment this game will be released, hundreds of negative reviews will hammer down...Because these days people are constantly b*tching about every single game and always trying to focus on the small negative details to the point that it became really a trend of whining. And now it's really hard to find an online multiplayer game without tons of bad reviews which is harming the game's player base. And eventually, it will lead to less motivation from the developer's side to fix things, since the game will feel dead anyway.You have to grow up and understand that you can't always have everything perfect especially in massive online games, so maybe you just need to fix your way of thinking and focus on having fun instead of aiming at digging as many cons as you can to look like Mr. Angry Rebel.

												Right no BS Review, If you dont like Call of Duty in general, This game won't change your mind.Its still a Call of Duty game.If you liked the original Call of Duty games you will enjoy it and if your a Call of Duty fan just buy it, you wont be let down.Optimisation-Isnt that bad although isnt where it should be but if you have a half decent rig don't worry you'll run it. Campaign- Amazing story, Really emotional moments through the whole story. Missions are very well paced(as most cod games) Level Design is on point, Looks amazing and many different ways to do the objective. Multiplayer- Needs a few balancing with guns and some map spawns but overall its what you want in a Boots on the ground Call of Duty.  With the new addition 'War' it changes up the usual cod formula, You can attack/defend The beaches of Normandy or fight in a snowy forest in Belguim during The Battle of the Bulge. Zombies-Much better then their first try at zombies( Exo Zombies) and much better then last years(IW Zombies) This year it takes it self more serious, Like Treyarch zombies but with a horror twist. If you are a noob at zombies it can be casual as it helps you do the easter egg but also if you are a hardcore zombies player like myself there is a good challenge. It comes with two maps, one being a small farmhouse, The other being the main map set in Miitleberg 'The Final Reich'. Its a very fun map and really comes close to being almost a Treyarch map as in terms if style and gameplay.So if you have never liked Cod this game isn't for you, but if you used to like it and/or still like them, Then pick it up."

If you're that person, please drink bleach.Positives:Really good use of sound. Good tension - especially the SOE mission.The health pack system means you have to be really careful of your positioning, or you die.A couple of minor things (not enough to ruin it for me) - The usual first-week issues with multiplayer.  Sometimes have to switch game modes to get a game, no big deal.Sniper get on hit kills on people that their cross-hairs aren't even over when you see it played back.  The hitboxes need reducing.The Thunderbolt mission - the controls for the plane are terrible, and it kept flipping out of the mission area.I didn't enjoy the driving sections on the missions.  Too easy on the hardest difficulty to clip a rock and fail the mission.It would be nicer if the enemies didn't drop everything to focus fire on the player, over squad mates who're open."

												The multiplayer is AMAZING! I consider this the best Call of Duty on PC! Just purchased the Season Pass today too because I look forward to spending many hours on this years Call of Duty..It's very refreshing being able to have a ""boots on the ground"" CoD again (in a World War 2 setting/theme). My favorite part of the game is the character customization and the lobby/camp that allows alot of players to all talk amongst each other and open crates earned from daily missions. It has an amazing social community and I pray that the community stays loyal and strong as the future content is released! Overall, I highly reccomend this Call of Duty to anyone who loves shooters, WW2 themed games, social interaction with the community, repetition, and replayability! ((My main hours will be tracked via the multiplayer WW2 client...not the singleplayer client)) I hope everyone else enjoys the game as much as I am too. See you on the battlefield!"

												The multiplayer is AMAZING! I consider this the best Call of Duty on PC! Just purchased the Season Pass today too because I look forward to spending many hours on this years Call of Duty..It's very refreshing being able to have a ""boots on the ground"" CoD again (in a World War 2 setting/theme). My favorite part of the game is the character customization and the lobby/camp that allows alot of players to all talk amongst each other and open crates earned from daily missions. It has an amazing social community and I pray that the community stays loyal and strong as the future content is released! Overall, I highly reccomend this Call of Duty to anyone who loves shooters, WW2 themed games, social interaction with the community, repetition, and replayability! ((My main hours will be tracked via the multiplayer WW2 client...not the singleplayer client)) I hope everyone else enjoys the game as much as I am too. See you on the battlefield!"

COD WWII: A great game slowly being killed by it's devs.I can't speak for the campaign as I don't touch the single-player side of the game. But the MP and Zombies is great. They have one of the best Call of Duty titles in a long while (Probably since BO2) but the poor dev team behind this is not delivering on their promises to the PC community and combined with poor balance updates and a rampant cheater problem it will slowly kill the game.I haven't seen too many cheaters in my games, Maybe 3-4 in the 60+ hours I've played but others are complaining about this saying that they are seeing a cheater every 2-3 games and that is a problem. Yes we have the cheater subreddit and the BanHammer Twitter account to report them (And yes it works, I reported someone and they was banned in 24 hours) but this doesn't solve everything. So many cheaters get to get away with it because someone may not know how to report someone or you may not have proof (Which you need if you are going to use the Reddit/Twitter reporting) We need the proper anti-cheat that was promised to us before the game was out.Also patches regarding weapon balance is very slow, The Kar-98k still remains unchanged and is the go-to sniper for everyone. No need to use anything else when this gun does it all. Also weapons like the FG-42 and the BAR was heavily nerfed to the point that they are almost unusable which is not fun at all.It's a shame because this game gets a lot of things right, From fun and exciting gameplay to the fun War gamemode to ranked play and a fair and well balanced Supply Drop system. Other things like the HQ, Daily missions, Armory Credits to buy your favourite skins directly (Still no option to buy Heroics yet SHG pls) It all makes a very fun and enjoyable game but with a few massive and glaring problems that is enough to turn some people away and make people stop playing. You have the chance to make this game special and make one of the best COD's for the last half a decade SHG please don't ♥♥♥♥ this up.PS. Oh I am giving this a positive review because I am mainly a 3rd gamemode/zombies player and the zombies in this game is really good. I tend to play my zombies solo so many of the problems listed above do not affect me. Sure there are problems about zombies like not getting supply drops after hitting Master Prestige, no Zombie missions like in the MP or the leaderboards just not working/updating but this is easy enough to live with for me."

												Jumping into this game, I was looking for something to help pass the time.  I have ben a COD fan for years, for both the story and multiplayer.Starting with the story, it is like eating boiled potatoes with no salt.  It is something to do and will hold you over, but not very exciting.  That is not to say that there are not any great moments, just not those moments that the series has given us before.  Also, the characters are bland and I did not care for them much.  Though the cutscenes were great, I did not care if anyone lived or died.The multiplayer, of course, is what we all come for.  This year, you will be hard pressed to find a match that did not stutter or lose connection too.  The remedy is usually a wired connection,  which I have, but does not seem to work.  Going through forums, this seems to be a common problem.   Though it has gotten better since release, it makes playing the game a chore.The game looks like Call of Duty, however, everything hasthis weird, muddy look.  I do not know if it is the game or my machine, since I can clock the game on high withour dipping below 60 FPS.  Not too bad, but definitly noticable and can make you look at the game sideways. There are some good moments, but I cannot recommend this game.  Wish I could get a refund, but I put too many hours in."

												It's a great idea. However, this wasn't executed well.Once these bugs are fixed, I'll change the review.PROS-Plenty of gamemodes.-Headquarters. Basically, a Destiny walk-around.-Joining a game is quick and easy.-Easy to rank-up.CONS (Lot of em.)-Campaign won't play without stuttering. It's way too graphic demanding.-Stuttering and lag in MP every 5 seconds. (FIXED)-Scorestreaks are way too hard to earn. Maybe it's just me.-Mortar strikes on the USS Texas are very laggy. (I THINK FIXED)-Toggle action. Don't get me started. Too many incendiary rounds. THERE'S 4 OF 'EM! Also, it's the Brecci of WW2. (THEY BUFFED THE TOGGLE ACTION ???)-Lee Enfield. Again, too much aim assist/damage/accuracy. Needs a nerf.-More may be added soon.I hope that Sledgehammer Games can fix the cons. I really love the game, but there's too many bugs, and I can't even play the campaign."

Here we've got support threads telling us to port forward, make changes to our routers to acommodate activision... ""Instert GIF, WHAT YEAR IS IT!?"".

												Oh how I waited for this game. Oh how I wanted to love this game. Having been another, there's so many of us it seems, player of the original CoD, CoD2 et al I'd been looking foward to going back. Back to the 'boots on the ground,' to the muddy foxholes and the constant pinging of Garand rifles firing their last round. Days, weeks even just lost in single player before even trying the MP experience.Unfortunately, a lot has changed in the gaming world since I last bought a CoD title ( I dodged most of the futuristic stuff as middle age spread precludes me from slipping on a jet pack these days,) and so it seems I've been spoiled with choices in the meantime, games with space to roam around a more open world, to decide how best to use the tools I have to make the attack I need to and games with the all important choice to cut short yet another cut scene....of which WWII has many. Great for the intitial story, pretty enough to look at but its just annoying on your second or third playthrough.   At this point I should point out I know, its CoD, of course it was always going to be a long corridor of death, flame, flying lead and cheesy dialogue (anyone thinking of buying this will no doubt have already come across the ""long way from Texas"" quote) ....but I did think that some of the corridors would appear a little less linear by now. Add to this the incredibly annoying number of times you had to fumble around with the QTE system. Mash 'F,' hold the middle button, wobble the mouse toward a circle and then press...wait, was that 'F' again, or 'wheel-up,' or perhaps 'G,' no, not 'G' that was just to frag myself out of sheer frustration. There are some new additions that I personally like, the 'buddy' system for health packs, ammo and the like is a nice idea - it's just too often your buddies aren't around or you've triggered another cut-scene so you can't grab much needed health or grenades until it shuffles slowly on like one of the wars actual remaining veterans. The thing is they've earned the right to be ageing and slow moving, a glitzy, big budget AAA with a linear corridor full of whizz bangs shouldn't be so, and when it is it seems even slower because of that linear, push, push, push sensation found in most of the game.  The stealthy roaming section is a welcome change of pace but once completed its back to the same old thing, which obviously includes the obligatory driving sequences. I personally loathe driving sequences in games that simply can't hope to make the driving experience fun or remotely like driving a car because of the WASD & mouse set-up...the same can be said for aircraft flying sequences in all honesty but that was my feeling years ago with the first two games in all fairness. Which, is pretty much my problem with CoD: WW2. Essentially, its pretty much exactly the same game as fifteen years ago only with a feeling of slightly less depth. Which should be great news, only fifteen years of not really effectively changing much that should be updated whilst, it seems, changing so much that should have been left well alone provides a bit of a hollow feeling. I haven't completely wasted my money, it is enough fun, but I do feel I should have waited, played a free weekend, watched some game play and decided if it was really all they trumpeted. It's pretty, the cut scenes are gorgeous which is just as well as you're in them for so much of the time...unless of course you hate the 'film grain' look, it is very Insta in that way. I'm hoping my lust for something slightly wider in scope and ambition may come in the form of a new Brothers In Arms, perhaps if this really is on the horizon they can marry narrative, explosions, fun and a degree of open worldliness all with a control system that is simple, logical and can be remapped.I won't bore you with MP talk as I've banged on enough about SP, suffice to say its similar to most previous titles: Killstreaks, weapon upgrades and so on. Although War mode is definitely a good addition, I just wish you had more than three stages to fight.All in all, despite a few nice additions the whole thing doesn't amount to much we haven't seen before so its a very slow Evolution rather than any kind of Revolution. I'm recommending it based purely on the fact that if you like any CoD you'll probably like at least something about this.A final note, some seem to have technical issues surrounding this game - I'm lucky and have encountered none so far."

												If this is the ""Quailty"" game making that big triple A compaines think is worth 60 USD then we may have to boycott them a little while longer.There are many historical inaccuracies and this is where i have to say that after this point in my review, THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.First and formost, the tanks that the germans are parading though a bombed out village for no one to see are also tanks that were not used until at least a year later in the war. Also a lot of the uniforms are missing some of their Swastikas and just are not built right. Next are the germans weapons, who appearently started building Russian weapons. I found it odd to find germans carring PPSH submachine guns and SVT-40s. They also had some weapons that i never even heard of so i can't really say much about those.Now lets talk about the sound track... and the one song it has for the whole campaign. It starts out with an opening sequence thats about a minute long and then the next 15 seconds is the same trumpet and violin just looped together. Mind you, its hard to tell it's a loop because the loop is seemless but still a loop which is kinda sad, considering that a 20 dollar game has a better sound track than this 60 dollar one.On top of all of that, even some of the campaign missions don't make a whole lot of sense and it really does start feeling like your the one person who is capible of winning World War 2 and if you were to die everyone else would just fail to push through all the Nazis. The cut scenes are not skippable and the character depth is about as deep as that puddle in your backyard (small puddle).So in conclusion, this game is not worth the asking price of 60 bucks, even factoring in Zombies and the Multiplayer. I say save your money and wait for this game to go on sale for 30 bucks then get it. If we're lucky, it'll go on sale for the Steam winter sale."

												tl;dr version, detailed PRO and CON below: After approx 10 hrs of SP and 30 hrs MP: Both are far away from very good, but they're still not bad as the majority of the reviews claim. Yes, the game has flaws, a lot small but no real big ones. People keep forgetting that this is still Call of Duty which hasnt changed much, so dont expect too much. Still, it's enjoyable and (barely) worth the money.I know I'll get a lot of negative feedback for this. I felt like writing this review anyway because I cant understand the majority of unjustified bad reviews. I also played the beta which was flawed, but still wasnt as bad as claimed. Also I gotta state that Im not the typical Call of Duty player due to the mostly dull and repetitive gameplay, even though I own some of the newer games because of Humble Bundle Monthly. I really loved the first two WW2 games, but also MW1/MW2 back in the days but got really bored with all those ""modern/future"" scenarios so I completely skipped these and waited for a proper WW2 themed game to come.SingleplayerPro-Nice, classic and mostly realistic***, no ""American-One-Man-Army"" story like the previous games-Well staged incidents and struggles-You got to play famous battles such as D-Day, Hürtgen Forest, and Bridge at Remagen-No health regeneration, squad-system for health, ammo and more, but not really needed on regular difficulty-Tankdriving, plane and stealth missions included***People especially complain about russian weapons which can be found on german soldiers on D-Day: This is far away from unrealistic. Upon invading the russians in 1941, the Wehrmacht has captured large parts of soviet weaponry (especially the PPSch-41 which was also modified to work with german ammunition) and after the eastern front was falling apart and armies had to retreat, some divisions were re-aligned to defend the french beaches. Even voluntary division from the ottoman empire, northern africa and eastern europe were present.Con-A lot of wasted potential. I mean come on: let us play as russians, as the french resistance, maybe even as the germans, italians, japanese. some covert ops or night mission or naval mission would've been nice. More famous battles or incidents: How can you not make a mission like when germany invades russia for the first time? Or The japanese attack on Pearl Habour. What about Sabotaging the secret weapons program in northern europe (and Peenemünde, Germany) ?!-Very short (as in every CoD: ~8 hrs) and only 10+ missions, also way too easy on regular-Basically no emotional attachment to the protagonist and its boring backstory-(German version: Censorship. No swastikas thanks to our silly laws. At least the MP is the same for everyone and violence was kept in both SP and MP)Multiplayer Pro-Usual Call of Duty gameplay and movement-War mode! 3 Unique objective based maps which are really fun-Good balanced weapons, no real allrounder (maybe except for the STG44 and BAR)-Good balanced perks-Prestige for your whole WW2 account as well for your Division/Class (unlocks unique weapon) and ALSO for every single gun (unlocks clan tags and kill counter)-A Headquarter where you can accept daily/weekly missions and challenges, duel other players in a 1on1, play ball, open loot chests (or watch others doing so), a shooting range, a scorestreak test area, alter your weapons at the gunsmith, unlock prestige and more-Loot chests can be easily earned, they only contain skins and other visual changes with wont make the game Pay-2-Win-Salty kids (they're funny as hell)Con-No real innovation. nothing much has changed, feels like a reskin of previous MW/BO games-Quickscoping/Noscoping in WW2 ?!-Pretty small weapon selection; ~28 weapons overall-Only around 9 maps, so you basically play the same 5 maps all the time in TDM-Map Carentan is Season Pass locked. SERIOUSLY WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU, ACTIVISION?!-Horrible spawns. Rarely you will immediately get killed-No emblem creator on PC yet (8th November 2017)-Disconnects from the server right after the game, you'll get the EXP and everything, but the win/loss wont count.-Sometimes the servers are horrible trash and it's impossible to play properly-Cheaters. Not many of them right now, but they're there and even promote their paid hacks in their names and VoIP. I dont get why the developers still rely on VAC. Just implement a proper anti-cheat like EAC or BattlEye which actually detect even the majority of the private hacks-Mortar strike, artillery etc. cause annoying screen shakes (even though it's realistic)-Forced SJW things like 5 pride flags as calling cards, female soldiers, blacks, asians, and so on-(Microtransactions are coming soon)-Salty kids (they're annoying as hell)OverallPro-Very good performance. I basically never get below 200-144 fps, no clue on what kind of potato people try to play the game. update your drivers or get a computer that isnt from 2010-Havent played zombie mode that much by now, but I guess it's fun as always-keys fully remappable and there is also a lefty mode, which I do like very muchCon-Graphics even on highest settings look average and dated-Sometimes Crashes in SP/MP, like 10 times in 40hrs of total gameplay-Menu controls are really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you can easily tell that these are due to the game being a console port"

												I put a quiet a bit of time into the Beta, and now im just now starting to play the multiplayer, I havnt touched much of the campaign, but it seems pretty solid.

Single Player: About 6-8 hours long depending on difficulty. It offers an OK linear single player mode which gives life to WW2. It's been a long time since Activision touched WW2, and their return to the era is done pretty well. You start off with D-Day in a story mode centered around the First Infantry Division. The D-Day map is pretty well done, and design wise is historically accurate. No sorry, no saving private ryan pillboxes here with germans being burnt out by flamethrowers from the beach. The map stays true to history having the player attack the vierville draw. You begin by falling out of a boat and rushing up the beach to the shingle all while under fire. I don't think that the beach is the correct length at low tide but whatever. After reaching the shingle, you blow a hole in it with a bangalore, and proceed through trench lines connected to widerstandsnest 72 (WN 72), and then up the main draw. So far so good. Correct placement of WN 72, and from where I was on the beach, WN 71 was in the correct spot too and featured the correct bunker systems and mortars. Moving up the draw you run into the anti tank wall that was destroyed, another authentic detail. Once in the bluff trench systems you manuevere through clearing bunkers and mortar pits. The pits also follow the current trend of authenticity showcasing the germans makeshift directions and landmarks carved into the circular tolbruk mortar bunkers.The big gripe I see mentioned so often is ""soviet weapons on D-Day is inacurrate"". Actually, it is accurate. The defenders were made up of thr 352nd Infantry Division, and the 439th Ost-Battalion. The Ost-Battalion was made up of eastern nationalities including those from the Soviet Union captured as POW's and forced to fight. In addition, there were also foreign legion type troops made up of eastern nationalities too. They used weaponry from the eastern front becasue germans would not waste thier weapons on penal groups and those they viewed lower than themselves (aka the ost battalion). This is why in a lot of film and in historical records you see ""germans"" surrendering and saying they aren't german. It's likely because they were ost-battalion.So thats kind of where the SP tapers off. Halfway through the D-Day mission you're dragging your friend while enemies roll out of cover like a 90's arcade shooter. It's just not very good gameplay wise. Much of the rest of the campaign is alright, but still suffers from that ""hero"" mentality where you as the main character have a more important role, you go off and save a soldier, disobey orders, and get dramatic with your senior nco's. All which is done for dramatic cinema effect, and makes it less realistic.All in all SP 5/10MultiplayerMP plays slower than recent cod games. It's really preference here, but I like it. I stopped buying into COD when they went the future route. I ignored the remastered cod4 too. In ww2 there are five divisions to choose from. Each of these divisons has about 4 perks that unlock as you level it up individually from your overall level. For instance the airborne divison has a supressor that unlocks and sprinting longer among some other perks.Weapons are unlocked via tokens whenever you wish as long as you have the level for them. Attachments for these guns are unlocked through completing different feats and are not bought with tokens. You can also add camos and change reticles like any other cod. Something new to ww2 is gun variants which have small bonuses like increases xp for the gun, or just better sights overall. Then you have ""training"" which are basically perks that give you a couple bonuses like hipfiring while sprinting (not as good as you think it is) or sprinting longer and reloading faster etc.The game modes are identical to most other cods, regular tdm, dom, ctf, s&d.. with some new ones like gridiron (ball in middle of the map you pick it up and score in opponents goal. People can shoot you.) Or War. War is pretty new and showcases some attack and defend objective gameplay. There are only 3 maps for War that are unique to war. One of which you attack a position, build a bridge, and escort a tank. Another is a D-Day representation which is insanely fun. Attackers start in boats, defenders in bunkers. It plays out just as you would expect. Rushing up the beach blowing a hole in the shingle, taking bunkers, taking a communication bunker, and destroying artillery guns. There are extra AI on the attackers side that don't do anything but provide some cover for the attackers. The defenders get about 5 mg42's spraying down, so you need some AI to make it harder to gun down players. The last war map is not even worth mentioning because its garbage. basically escort 3 tanks, escort them again.. ah yeah im bored already.As far as the other maps go, it feels like there aren't many. There are 9 maps for people who didn't buy the season pass, and 10 if you did. Of the 9 maps, 3 of them are poorly designed in my opinion. Gustav Cannon, Uss Texas, and aachen. Gustav cannon is primarily a large open map with lots of clutter around the edges, USS texas is a 3 lane map thats small, and Aachen is another 3 lane map that rreally plays into the lanes more than anything.All in all the MP is good. I haven't played a reaction based shooter in a long time so it's refreshing to play.Solid 8/10 MP, probably one of the top 3 cod mp's thus far.So I'd definitely say buy this game for the MP because it's good and a much needed departure from the stupid rocket jumping and BS from past cods. You're still going to run into quickscoping and snipers, ""cheap play"" and meta's. Thats just how cod is. I've never not played one that didn't have these things."

												First of all before I get into this review don't trust any reviews that people have played less than 10 combine hours. Those are just troll reviews that despise the franchise. I have 7 hours in campaign and 5 hours on multiplayer 12 combine hours. (At the time of me writing this.)Online: Full of try hards. Not going to lie about online it's hard. I have been played C.O.D. since MW2. I find it has the most challenging multi player of them all. Almost everyone will be better than you and sometimes it will take a lot of bullets to kill 1 person and you are going to yell and rage. But you have to realize it Call of Duty, who doesn't rage? Single Player: Amazing! Great, I ran my graphics on medium just fine on my 16gb's of Ram, and 750ti. People that say they have trouble running it are not the britest. Anyways the cutscenes were laggy and stutery, I got 30 fps in cut scenes. Campaign has a very interesting story and the characters are rememberable. Zombies: F*ucking great! Best zombies in the recent Call of Duty games execpt for Black Ops 1. I'm pretty sure everyone can say that was the best game for zombies! I love the opening cut scene into the zombies when you first launch it up. I can't speak for  others but it was really errie. Please Note: It's Call of Duty ITS NOT GONNA BE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE!

												I must say, just like everyone else I was very hesitant to buy this game. The last CoD game I bought was Modern Warfare 3, the others Bo2 and 3 I got gifted. CoD lost its character.however when I started playing this game, it was like I was playing modern warfare for the first time.The guns feel good, everything is balanced.Now yes, there are performance issues, I have a GTX680 and play everything on low, however it runs and still looks good. i am not really about graphics though.Zombies is great, if you know what youre doing you can get pretty far and have a lot of fun. just make sure you have some friends to play with.Multiplayer is also great. The leveling system is great, headquarters brings a fresh experience to the game. The maps aren't really good though. Many small corridors and pre-determined choke points in the map. But it feels like old-fashioned CoD, so I ain't got no complaining to do.It's just not a game to play like CS:GO, it's not competitive or something to really get into.This is more a game to play here and there, otherwise it will get boring pretty quickly.My tip, if you think you can play this game for 60 hours+, then its worth it."

												First of all before I get into this review don't trust any reviews that people have played less than 10 combine hours. Those are just troll reviews that despise the franchise. I have 7 hours in campaign and 5 hours on multiplayer 12 combine hours. (At the time of me writing this.)Online: Full of try hards. Not going to lie about online it's hard. I have been played C.O.D. since MW2. I find it has the most challenging multi player of them all. Almost everyone will be better than you and sometimes it will take a lot of bullets to kill 1 person and you are going to yell and rage. But you have to realize it Call of Duty, who doesn't rage? Single Player: Amazing! Great, I ran my graphics on medium just fine on my 16gb's of Ram, and 750ti. People that say they have trouble running it are not the britest. Anyways the cutscenes were laggy and stutery, I got 30 fps in cut scenes. Campaign has a very interesting story and the characters are rememberable. Zombies: F*ucking great! Best zombies in the recent Call of Duty games execpt for Black Ops 1. I'm pretty sure everyone can say that was the best game for zombies! I love the opening cut scene into the zombies when you first launch it up. I can't speak for  others but it was really errie. Please Note: It's Call of Duty ITS NOT GONNA BE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE! It's a video game people want to play them not learn from them. If you want to learn history well then pay more attention is history class. So please stop complaining about historical accuracy.

Single Player: About 6-8 hours long depending on difficulty. It offers an OK linear single player mode which gives life to WW2. It's been a long time since Activision touched WW2, and their return to the era is done pretty well. You start off with D-Day in a story mode centered around the First Infantry Division. The D-Day map is pretty well done, and design wise is historically accurate. No sorry, no saving private ryan pillboxes here with germans being burnt out by flamethrowers from the beach. The map stays true to history having the player attack the vierville draw. You begin by falling out of a boat and rushing up the beach to the shingle all while under fire. I don't think that the beach is the correct length at low tide but whatever. After reaching the shingle, you blow a hole in it with a bangalore, and proceed through trench lines connected to widerstandsnest 72 (WN 72), and then up the main draw. So far so good. Correct placement of WN 72, and from where I was on the beach, WN 71 was in the correct spot too and featured the correct bunker systems and mortars. Moving up the draw you run into the anti tank wall that was destroyed, another authentic detail. Once in the bluff trench systems you manuevere through clearing bunkers and mortar pits. The pits also follow the current trend of authenticity showcasing the germans makeshift directions and landmarks carved into the circular tolbruk mortar bunkers.The big gripe I see mentioned so often is ""soviet weapons on D-Day is inacurrate"". Actually, it is accurate. The defenders were made up of thr 352nd Infantry Division, and the 439th Ost-Battalion. The Ost-Battalion was made up of eastern nationalities including those from the Soviet Union captured as POW's and forced to fight. In addition, there were also foreign legion type troops made up of eastern nationalities too. They used weaponry from the eastern front becasue germans would not waste thier weapons on penal groups and those they viewed lower than themselves (aka the ost battalion). This is why in a lot of film and in historical records you see ""germans"" surrendering and saying they aren't german. It's likely because they were ost-battalion.So thats kind of where the SP tapers off. Halfway through the D-Day mission you're dragging your friend while enemies roll out of cover like a 90's arcade shooter. It's just not very good gameplay wise. Much of the rest of the campaign is alright, but still suffers from that ""hero"" mentality where you as the main character have a more important role, you go off and save a soldier, disobey orders, and get dramatic with your senior nco's. All which is done for dramatic cinema effect, and makes it less realistic.All in all SP 5/10MultiplayerMP plays slower than recent cod games. It's really preference here, but I like it. I stopped buying into COD when they went the future route. I ignored the remastered cod4 too. In ww2 there are five divisions to choose from. Each of these divisons has about 4 perks that unlock as you level it up individually from your overall level. For instance the airborne divison has a supressor that unlocks and sprinting longer among some other perks.Weapons are unlocked via tokens whenever you wish as long as you have the level for them. Attachments for these guns are unlocked through completing different feats and are not bought with tokens. You can also add camos and change reticles like any other cod. Something new to ww2 is gun variants which have small bonuses like increases xp for the gun, or just better sights overall. Then you have ""training"" which are basically perks that give you a couple bonuses like hipfiring while sprinting (not as good as you think it is) or sprinting longer and reloading faster etc.The game modes are identical to most other cods, regular tdm, dom, ctf, s&d.. with some new ones like gridiron (ball in middle of the map you pick it up and score in opponents goal. People can shoot you.) Or War. War is pretty new and showcases some attack and defend objective gameplay. There are only 3 maps for War that are unique to war. One of which you attack a position, build a bridge, and escort a tank. Another is a D-Day representation which is insanely fun. Attackers start in boats, defenders in bunkers. It plays out just as you would expect. Rushing up the beach blowing a hole in the shingle, taking bunkers, taking a communication bunker, and destroying artillery guns. There are extra AI on the attackers side that don't do anything but provide some cover for the attackers. The defenders get about 5 mg42's spraying down, so you need some AI to make it harder to gun down players. The last war map is not even worth mentioning because its garbage. basically escort 3 tanks, escort them again.. ah yeah im bored already.As far as the other maps go, it feels like there aren't many. There are 9 maps for people who didn't buy the season pass, and 10 if you did. Of the 9 maps, 3 of them are poorly designed in my opinion. Gustav Cannon, Uss Texas, and aachen. Gustav cannon is primarily a large open map with lots of clutter around the edges, USS texas is a 3 lane map thats small, and Aachen is another 3 lane map that rreally plays into the lanes more than anything.All in all the MP is good. I haven't played a reaction based shooter in a long time so it's refreshing to play.Solid 8/10 MP, probably one of the top 3 cod mp's thus far.So I'd definitely say buy this game for the MP because it's good and a much needed departure from the stupid rocket jumping and BS from past cods. You're still going to run into quickscoping and snipers, ""cheap play"" and meta's. Thats just how cod is. I've never not played one that didn't have these things."

												I thought this game was going to be going back to the roots of the original but nope, it's bascially a extremely historically inaccurate version of what we have come to know already. Historically inaccruate to include ppsh-41 used by germans and incendiary rounds in shotguns. MP is trash with quick scoping and incendiary rounds in shotguns. Don't bother."

												Got a taste of multiplayer and the first campaign mission, had a lot of fun in both.  Runs very well on high settings with a 1070 & 7700.  The multiplayer headquarters area is really cool, it adds a lot of depth and it's a cool little social area.  Lots of new features in contrast to previous CoD titles.  This is my first CoD experience on PC, I came into this expecting disappotment, but I'm liking it a lot."

												NOTE: I only play the multiplayer of CoD games, so that is all this review will be focusing on. The five minutes of liisted playtime is from me idling on the single player's main menu so I could post this review, because time spent in multiplayer doesn't count. Thanks Steam!I'll keep it short. CoD WW2 is a painfully mediocre game. I only picked this title up after swearing off CoD for the past 3 years (due to the SciFi/hero shooter garbage they tried to cram into those games) because it promised to be a return to the series' roots.If you judge it only on that, then the developers kept their promise and it should be a good game. Right? Well, it also has the worst maps that I can think of for a CoD game. On top of this, it only has NINE maps as well, THREE of which can only be played in the ""War"" game mode. The sniper rifles are also the most overpowered they have been I can recall in recent memory, with extremely fast scope-in times and very generous OHK areas.The netcode is also spotty at times, as often I would get put into a match with all ""green"" connections (because SHG can't trust us to know our own exact ping, apparently) but there will be players who are easily a second or two ahead of the action and score tons of easy kills.What's good about the game? Well, it is a boots-on-the-ground CoD and it seems to be well optimized (FYI, I am running a four-year old i5 and a 970 GTX) for the most part. Would I recommend this game overall? Probably not, unless you are a die hard CoD fan. There just isn't enough to entice the average gamer and keep them coming back, unless they are a hardcore fraghead who doesn't mind playing the same six TDM maps over and over.OVERALL SCORE: 6 / 10"

												I will start off by saying that I have yet to jump into Multiplayer and I know that part of the game is the where most people will spend their time. but the campaign, although mildly captivating, is steadilly irritating.  I am not some MLG pro, or an FPS elitest, but I can say that it is pretty lame that even on the lowest difficulty it takes multiple headshots at close range to kill an enemy.  Even the 1911 at point blank has failed me many times.  The controls are on the higher side of mediocre.  Keyboard/Mouse config is meh... not super intuitive for a PC FPS.  Using a controller doesnt seem to make much difference either, I have found myself eating dirt, in game, while trying to melee the enemy.  This has happened more times than not.  I find that when I decide to stop playing the game it is because I am irritated, instead of feeling like I accomplished something and enjoyed my time in game.  To be fair, this is an early review and all of this may change when I put more time into it and explore the other features of the game.- As of now this is how I rate Call of Duty: WWII -Graphics: 8/10Audio: 8.5/10Gameplay: 6.5/10 (subject to change after multiplayer is factored in)"

												I couldn't help but notice all the negative reviews. I had to put my two cents in. To summarize, the game is awesome. I mean, in it's own way. Well not even it's own, because when they advertised ""back to its roots"" they meant it. The game play is VERY similar to what I remember of the old Call of Duty. When I say old, I don't mean Black OPs or Modern Warfare. I mean Big Red One and even earlier. It's what started the franchise. This may explain the negativity. Lots of the current generation gamers don't like the simplicity. They seem to want all the complexity of newer games with all the bells and whistles. This game is straight forward and that's what I played as a kid. Games that had endless enemies coming out of no where and constantly exploiting health packs and cover.

												Final Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpx3eescQwU&feature=youtu.beWorld War II is the first game in the franchise to feature a WW2 setting in nearly 10 years, and it’s a return to form for a franchise that has been strongly scrutinized this console generation. The game’s story is brilliantly done, with great performances, good writing, excellent battle sequences, some unique gameplay designs, and a polished experience overall. The game’s zombie and multiplayer modes also deliver excellent experiences that feel more grounded than the past couple of games, something that long-time fans will greatly appreciate. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -First Impressions:https://youtu.be/ltrq7LqdXZk"

												(Don't buy this game on steam)So I pre-ordered this game and got it a few weeks ago. I don't usually play cod but since it's world war 2 related, I figured I would give it a shot, heheh, get it, give it a shot....sorry for the very corny joke. I think that releasing this game when almost half the features aren't even added to the game is really unreasonable. Sledgehammer also didn't even bother to check if there was still any bugs in the game. I have played some of this game and I think that it is decent, but almost all the time, my game crashes. I don't exactly know why, but I would like to point it out so they can change that in further updates. Everything is also stale and feels completely unfinished. They also need to nerf explosive damage, because it is WAY to op. Every second I see grenades flying all over the place, and there's no way you can escape a grenade in this game, as they explode way too fast even when you don't cook the grenade. I also want to mention that zombies in this game is WAY too easy. Most of the time I'm stuck in a match for so long that I get super tired. Also, I ranked up 2 or 3 times in one match but then the server host left the game, which apparently caused the whole match to end, not even giving me the xp that I earned that round. There are so many reasons why this game isn't worth 59.99. I really should have waited, or probably not have bought the game, but let's just wait and see if we can get a good update."

												Not sure why this game is getting negative reviews for performance issues. Game runs smoothly for me on high to ultra settings. i am pretty sure most people dont have the newest drivers installed for their GPU's. either that or the specs they are listing for their pc specs are lies.  i have a gtx 1070 sc and a ryzen 1700x  OC@4.0ghz.  like i mentioned before i get 100+ fps on high to ultra settings. being a veteran cod player and played all the titles up till advanced warfare. i must say i was a bit skeptical of this game when i played the open beta on ps4, xbox, and pc. game was choppy and not much options. but again it was beta so it was expected. after now playing campaign and multiplayer on the actuall game i must say that i truely enjoy what i have experienced so far. definitely exceeded my expectations. Servers are a bit laggy on multiplayer but im sure that will be resolved. one thing that stood out that i really like what they did was the whole headquarters thing. definitely adds more to the whole multiplayer experience.i have not tried zombies yet but will soon. i will update review when i do. friends of mine told me that the zombies is really fun. well see. i purchased the digital deluxe addition of this game, however, i do recommend buying the basic addition of this game for $60."

												Call of Duty: Big Red One (for the good game for the 1st Infantry Division)If you wanted a game that would rekindle some sort of old nostalgic good feeling you had growing up playing Call of Duty, let it be known that this game will not do anything of the sort. The campaign is terrible, no such historical accuracy (since when in the Western front did Germans have Soviet weapons?), no such accurate military organization (a platoon is a group of five to six guys apparently), terrible vehicle controls (tank and fighters were terribly mapped), and to top it off the game is laughably for children and have no real substance.What do you get when you put Josh Duhamel (the Airforce Colonel from Transformers) into an antihero role, mix in some cliche brotherly bonding, add some failure to adhere to any military organization, a dash of Germans armed with Soviet rifles and SMGs, and top it off with a big manure of terrible vehicle controls? You get Call of Duty World War II (the failed WWII first person shooter). Also the music tried very hard to copy the same feelings from Michael Giacchino's work from the Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Franchise, but did not balance the terrible game play at all.Go play Call of Duty 1 and 2, United Offensive, or Call of Duty: World and War for the real WWII titles. Hell go play Medal of Honor: Allied Assault on Origin, since they are avaible for cheap on that platform. Or go buy EA's Battlefront 2"

												Final Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpx3eescQwU&feature=youtu.beWorld War II is the first game in the franchise to feature a WW2 setting in nearly 10 years, and it’s a return to form for a franchise that has been strongly scrutinized this console generation. The game’s story is brilliantly done, with great performances, good writing, excellent battle sequences, some unique gameplay designs, and a polished experience overall. The game’s zombie and multiplayer modes also deliver excellent experiences that feel more grounded than the past couple of games, something that long-time fans will greatly appreciate. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -First Impressions:https://youtu.be/ltrq7LqdXZk"

												To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂"

												In terms of a recent CoD game, this one is a step in the right direction. Its got a decent story, zombies is fantastic, and the multiplayer is pretty standard. So all in all that would make this a positive review right? Yes, it would if i didnt have to spend 5-10 minutes on a loading screen. on top of that, half the time it never loads at all and i have to close the game. this franchise is one of the highest grossing titles every year.

												I purchased the new COD even when I read all the bad about it.  It plays okay, but I do get some lag and stuttering every now and then.  What disappointed me was the in accuracy of uniforms and weapons.  What done it for me was that there were PPSH-41s on DDay.  I was curious and some say that it could have happened, but from what I've read there are a lot of in accuracies.  Especially the guy with the Thompson with the drum magazine.  Maybe they had them there, maybe not.  I'm no expert.  I was really excited when I first saw this game hoping it would take me back to the first Call of Duty.  I would really like to see another Call of Duty set in WW2 or Vietnam.  Just take time to research and make it right."

												Aside from the historically inaccurate multiplayer, and the inability to connect to the COD WW2 servers some days, I would say it is a solid 70% rating. Sledgehammer, clearly did not test their product out, and conduct rehearsals to release this product if they are having server issues. They could have upped their score by paying attention to history, and testing out their release. Also, not to mention, the random crashes now and then are absolutely awesome.

												(Don't buy this game on steam)So I pre-ordered this game and got it a few weeks ago. I don't usually play cod but since it's world war 2 related, I figured I would give it a shot, heheh, get it, give it a shot....sorry for the very corny joke. I think that releasing this game when almost half the features aren't even added to the game is really unreasonable. Sledgehammer also didn't even bother to check if there was still any bugs in the game. I have played some of this game and I think that it is decent, but almost all the time, my game crashes. I don't exactly know why, but I would like to point it out so they can change that in further updates. Everything is also stale and feels completely unfinished. They also need to nerf explosive damage, because it is WAY to op. Every second I see grenades flying all over the place, and there's no way you can escape a grenade in this game, as they explode way too fast even when you don't cook the grenade. I also want to mention that zombies in this game is WAY too easy. Most of the time I'm stuck in a match for so long that I get super tired. Also, I ranked up 2 or 3 times in one match but then the server host left the game, which apparently caused the whole match to end, not even giving me the xp that I earned that round. There are so many reasons why this game isn't worth 59.99. I really should have waited, or probably not have bought the game, but let's just wait and see if we can get a good update."

												Call of Duty: WWII is a breath of fresh air for me while still having the core elements of a CoD game. It doesn't do anything especially new, but it feels so good to not have people running on walls, bouncing around the map or jumping over buildings, it reminds me so much of WaW without being the same. I don't think I've had this much fun in a CoD multiplayer since MW2. I think it's worth a buy, but if you expect to not find people complaining, trash talking, camping, quickscoping or using the meta (PPSH, Incindiary rounds and STG) you clearly haven't played a Call of Duty game.In conclusion, good game, good feel, same CoD.I'd give it 7.5 Heil Hitlers out of 10"

												So far 10/10 Campaign, everything I wanted. If you're a fan of war-porn or band of brothers, give the campaign a shot, best campaign since MW2. Sledgehammer have also decided to show the PC some love with continued (and necessary) updates, which previous titles have just flat out neglected. So kudos to sledge.Edit: Woah, that Liberation of France mission was pretty incroyable. Superb amounts of fun.People don't know how to use computers, don't let the negative reviews fool you. There's more that goes into an optimised build than just throwing money at a GPU and CPU. The review section doesnt exist for people to air their unoptimised builds to the public and cry without actually going into any detail about their build.Will update after a continued multiplayer experience."

												The single player campaign is surprisingly ok. It's no World At War but you can tell they're at least trying this time. With every single piece of western media about the American POV wrapped into a high octane ""story"", it's not exactly going to stick with you why it's happening, but it sure will look pretty. Everybody is a walking cliche, but the gunplay is tight and they do try ""some"" new things narrative wise. Multiplayer is fairly standard COD for better or worse. With an added Destiny styled HUB zone. In my first 5 minutes there, I overheard a player offering to suck off players that let him watch him open their crates. So yeah that kind of says it all about the other players in multiplayer."

												Glad to see COD return to the WW2 era. This installment won't change the minds of people who have loathed cod for years. But for the people like me who still had faith in the series even through the bad times I'd recommend it. Campaign is pretty good, MP is what it's always been but way better than futuristic♥♥♥♥♥♥ and zombies is zombies(which means pretty damn fun). I personally haven't had an issue with cheaters/server issues but some have so take that how you will.  If I had to compare it to another game it'd be Black Ops 2, not astounding but still pretty solid. But it definitely seems fantastic compared to that trash infinite warfare."

												Ignore the negative wave of comments, definitely doing that in purpose to make it look bad.Campaign is great, they made us feel like it's going to be all SJW♥♥♥♥♥♥and altered history, but it's not at all. They made a pure, brutal WW2 experience. I can easily say it's the best campaign story since MW2. Gives you mixed emotions about the characters. There are Swastikas everywhere. There is brutality and gore everywhere. I don't understand how people say it's ""SJW"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, there are 2 main female characters in the game and they are from the French Resistance, which is normal since French Resistance had female fighters. That's my 2 cents about the campaign. Still yet to play the Multiplayer though.As for performance, i played the entirety of the campaign above 120+ FPS on all maxed, everything to the fullest.My Specs:i7 7700kGTX107016GB 2133Mhz RamI'm %90 sure the negative reviews are just spams from people who hate Call of Duty no matter what."

												Everybody is rating this down for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reasons. The graphics are better than promised, the gameplay and map structure is top of the line, and in game audio/music gives me chills the whole time. Only on the fourth mission, update this later. Update-Finished the game.Not going to lie, I teared up in multiple parts of the game. Absolutely had my attention the entire time. Not ever was there a second I was distracted.(unless you count mild momento hunting)Overall, I give the game a solid 8.5/10 and here's why.There wasnt many things I could dislike about the game, other than these things.1. Russian weapons are scattered everywhere, which is weird. I know the Germans used Polands arsenal after capitulating them, but they are very abundant throughout the game. (could be that the devs wanted to add them in so the Russian fan-boys would be happy)2. Snow graphics on soldier uniforms was probably about the only graphical thing I disliked. It looked pretty blurry but, I was able to get used to it. 3. Difficulty system might need some work, the difference between them is pretty drastic. In the Recruit difficulty the Germans hardly ever land a shot at you and look like storm troopers. Hardened (which is what I played the beginning on) I was getting shot through walls and in places I wasn't even seen by the enemy. 4. It was just a little too short, was hoping for an 8 hour campaign. But im not mad, it was a great campaign. Overall, like I said. Graphics,music,sound quality, and gameplay made this game one of the best COD's I will probably ever play. P.S. Battlefield is crap compared to this in my opinion and I played countless hours in it.Also forgot to add- the airplane mission, was ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. I didn't know what was happening because my plane was spiraling out on its own. Maybe this was an out manevuering mechanic of some sort."

												As a pre-note if anyone sees this, I wanted to give this COD a thorough review, because I think it does deserve a shot, and shouldn't be written off as another blunder... This is a good call of duty in my opinion. Is it a good WW2 simulator? No. Is it historically accurate 100%? No. But that's not a bad thing. It's just not what Call of Duty is.-First off, I feel as if the campaign is one of the better ones in a few years. Yes, it has your typical Call of Duty fare (some QTE's, slow-mo kills, crazy set pieces straight from a Michael Bay set, and plenty of NPC's to kill), but isn't that what Call of Duty is known for? There's a reason it's consistently one of the top selling games of the year. If you do not like this, then don't buy the game. Simple. However, COD's campaign sees some welcome changes such as there is now a health bar that doesn't naturally heal back if you take cover. I can tell you, I have died more often in this campaign than in all previous campaigns combined, and that's a good thing. Another addition is that you can enlist the help of A.I. squad mates who provide certain bonuses that are set on timers (get thrown a health pack, call in a motar strike, outline enemies, etc.) As always, the gameplay runs fluid and the shooting is fun as usual. The story is good too. While it may be cheesy at times, it works into the Call of Duty formula well. And to those who ♥♥♥♥♥ about the ""historic"" inaccuracies, I am a big history buff, and I didn't feel pulled out of the experience at any time. One last thing to mention, is that this game looks ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful, especially in the campaign. Let's put it this way... I couldn't tell the difference between cinematics and actual gameplay.   Campaign 9/10-Multiplayer. Now this is COD's bread and butter. And personally I've been waiting almost 4 years for true boots on the ground (Screw Ghosts), and I personally feel like WW2 delivers. The gunplay is as smooth as ever, but I do feel like the time to kill isn't as low as previous entries, which is a refreshing change. I wasn't able to gun down 4 people with a single clip of the bar; I had to reload after just 20 bullets. Everything has been toned down a bit this time around, including movement speed, aiming down sights (sniper), and reloading, which makes COD WW2, for me, more tactical. I actually felt I had to think about when I reloaded and where. However, a few weapons do seem to fall into the designated-weapon trap, and as always this is disapointing. I also found the selection of maps a let-down as well. I did not expect the maps we saw in the beta, be half the offered maps. One last thing, for me personally that mattered, was that the bots seemed harder. I appreciated this, because I enjoy playing offline, but I also enjoy having a challenge. And previously it always seemed like there was no sweet spot for challenge with the bots (they were either crazy impossible or I was going deathless in a  match). Multiplayer 7.5/10-Zombies. This one is short. I was a bit disapointed with the zombies mode to be frank. Good things. The zombies are actually kind of menacing now, and there's more of a ""progressive story"" element than before. What is disapointing is that at it's core, it's a lot more of the same. Bullet squisy zombies. Point system. Wave based. Considering how much hype there was around this ""new"" zombies experience, I wish they had been a little for innovative with this. Zombies 6/10Overall, like I said above, I think  this is a good call of duty. A great one in fact. Is it game of the year quality? No, probably not. But it's core gameplay mechanics are great and it's a fun way to eat hours into the afternoon."

												I don't know why everybody in this community has to be so toxic.  Yes, there are some historical flaws, but if you want to play a game that is perfectly accurate in everything it does then good luck finding it.  Also, I see an awful lot of people who haven't even played for an hour and are giving it bad reviews. I mean this is ridiculous.  Name a game that came out on launch day and was absolutely perfect with no flaws or glitches.  It is a good game and they are finally going back to their roots.

This years Multiplayer is like none we have seen before, The new headquarders feature was confusing at first, but I atcually am starting to like it now. I also like the war gamemode, it reminds me of battlefield with its bigger map an matches lasting 30mins to an hour. My only problem was, they didn't add some of my favorite wepons like the mosin negantand the Browning M1919. I also like the zombies pretty well, my favorite feature is being able to drop points so your team mates and get them, This is smething I wanted in Zombies since 2009.

												I'm going to break this down into a few different parts. There will be some very minor spoilers here talking about what kinds of enemies you're facing and how the levels are set up. I'm going to respond to some of the thumbs down verdicts here and air out my biggest grievances with the game. You'll see a lot of complaints about historical inaccuracies and the DLC. First off, the season pass has always been the same price and it always gives the same content. You know what you're getting. Second, if you're complaining about inaccuracy in a cod game you're objectively ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. One of the top reviews here complains about the length of the beach at Normandy. Congratulations, you just called Cod not realistic enough as if it were at all in the first place. As for the swastika crap, it's only in multiplayer. If you're playing this game's multiplayer for a realistic experience, you're in the wrong area. Don't listen to these people, they're idiots. If you think I'm pro political correctness, look at my profile.As for my complaints, it's mainly about bugs and poor level design. This new Cod has a new health system in single player where you need to resupply it with med kits, which are easy enough to get and manage. The problem is if you die and don't have enough health before you do, it can bone you. One of the checkpoints continuously spawned me into enemy machine gun fire, which removed nearly all my health instantly. That's dumb. Another bug has to do with the weapons the game provides you. You can pick up LMGs from foxholes and carry them with you. The problem is after you enter a mini-cutscene these disappear. One level it took away my LMG and replaced it with a rocket launcher. And I already had a bazooka. So, I had to play the next half of the level with two rocket launchers. This prevented me from completing ""hero"" actions which are awesome. Hero actions are mini events where you can help and ally in trouble whether that's pulling injured soldiers to safety, helping them fight off Germans, etc. You can see the problem when I only have a bazooka while someone I am trying to help is fighting a German. Can't complete the event. Most of this I can look past except one thing: vehicle controls. This is where the worst spoilers are, but it isn't that bad just skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. The jeep/truck ones are fine. However, there is a tank and a fighter plane level. The controls in both felt clunky and really infuriated me. However, the fighter level at some sort of auto-lock on where you can follow a plane and shoot at it if you hold down the aim button. The tank one, not so much. It's probably the worst level of any game I have played ever. The premise is you're in a tank and you can't destroy other tanks from the front. So, you need to flank them. Easy enough. However, they decide to stick with realism this time around and make it, so the tank's turret turns at a mile per hour. It's frustrating to get a flank and not be able to kill them because it takes a year to line up your shot. Bad level in an otherwise enjoyable game.There were two other hero events that came up that sucked. One was a guy who was down in front of a sniper's nest who you had to take care of. His fire rate was insane, and I couldn't pull him to safety with full health. The other was a guy halfway across the map while all the paths were blocked off by 20+ enemies. And a tank. There were a couple of other bugs like a soldier I did damage to still killed me because it was part of a mini cutscene, but I can overlook that. As for the multiplayer, it's great. They introduced a bunch of new systems like collections which allow you to get new versions of your weapons. You basically collect random stuff from supply drops and they build up over time. The one complaint I have about it is the Jekyll Hyde persona the game has with its framerate. With nothing else running, I can get 70-100+ FPS on a map, play the same map again on the same game mode, and get 40. It's dumb and it needs to get fixed. The settings I'm playing on by the way are 1280x768 (something like that) with nearly everything on low. This is on a 4790k and a GTX 770 with 16GB of RAM, very lightly used I put it together a few months ago. I'm not playing on some potato here.Things this game does well: I love the story. I think it ends a bit too cleanly in the end, but it's really well done. I thought the characters were split about 50/50. Half were some of the best flushed-out and well-developed characters I had ever seen, and the other half were characters that I was supposed to care about but new nothing of. One of my favorite characters was Sergeant Foley from MW2. The game introduces a character about halfway through that is almost exactly like him and I love it. You can make a compelling argument the devs did it for PC reasons especially the way he's introduced, but he's awesome nonetheless.They introduced a few new mechanics too that I really enjoy. Besides the health bar and hero events, they overhauled the stealth system. It appears in previous Cods you had no option to stealth a level all the way through and you could go back to stealth after you pass a certain part of the level if they catch you. Other times if you get caught you have the restart the level. In this game you can creep all the way through and if you get caught, everyone knows where you are. You can finish the level loud if you choose too. There's one section of forced stealth but that's it and it's for a good reason (play the game and find out). Even though it's only done once there's a level that requires you to cover a teammate. Basically, shooting at a bunker causes it to stop firing at your teammates and you order them to move up as you're covering them. I wish they do this with future Cods. That level with the tank I talked about earlier? You must destroy it by placing bombs on it while fighting off enemies. These are cool RPG-like elements they added to a generally linear-style game and it's fantastic. There's also a level where you need to memorize response and give them back to people which is cool.Verdict: If you like Cod or think it's a hit/miss you'll most likely enjoy it. The people complaining about the game are mostly idiots. The game has some glaring issues especially in MP with the framerate and some of the bugs in the story, but both are fantastic and worth $60. Worst case, pick this up when it goes on sale it will be worth it."

Hero actions are mini events where you can help and ally in trouble whether that's pulling injured soldiers to safety, helping them fight off Germans, etc. You can see the problem when I only have a bazooka while someone I am trying to help is fighting a German. Can't complete the event. Most of this I can look past except one thing: vehicle controls. This is where the worst spoilers are, but it isn't that bad just skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. The jeep/truck ones are fine. However, there is a tank and a fighter plane level. The controls in both felt clunky and really infuriated me. However, the fighter level at some sort of auto-lock on where you can follow a plane and shoot at it if you hold down the aim button. The tank one, not so much. It's probably the worst level of any game I have played ever. The premise is you're in a tank and you can't destroy other tanks from the front. So, you need to flank them. Easy enough. However, they decide to stick with realism this time around and make it, so the tank's turret turns at a mile per hour. It's frustrating to get a flank and not be able to kill them because it takes a year to line up your shot. Bad level in an otherwise enjoyable game.There were two other hero events that came up that sucked. One was a guy who was down in front of a sniper's nest who you had to take care of. His fire rate was insane, and I couldn't pull him to safety with full health. The other was a guy halfway across the map while all the paths were blocked off by 20+ enemies. And a tank. There were a couple of other bugs like a soldier I did damage to still killed me because it was part of a mini cutscene, but I can overlook that. As for the multiplayer, it's great. They introduced a bunch of new systems like collections which allow you to get new versions of your weapons. You basically collect random stuff from supply drops and they build up over time. The one complaint I have about it is the Jekyll Hyde persona the game has with its framerate. With nothing else running, I can get 70-100+ FPS on a map, play the same map again on the same game mode, and get 40. It's dumb and it needs to get fixed. The settings I'm playing on by the way are 1280x768 (something like that) with nearly everything on low. This is on a 4790k and a GTX 770 with 16GB of RAM, very lightly used I put it together a few months ago. I'm not playing on some potato here.Things this game does well: I love the story. I think it ends a bit too cleanly in the end, but it's really well done. I thought the characters were split about 50/50. Half were some of the best flushed-out and well-developed characters I had ever seen, and the other half were characters that I was supposed to care about but new nothing of. One of my favorite characters was Sergeant Foley from MW2. The game introduces a character about halfway through that is almost exactly like him and I love it. You can make a compelling argument the devs did it for PC reasons especially the way he's introduced, but he's awesome nonetheless.They introduced a few new mechanics too that I really enjoy. Besides the health bar and hero events, they overhauled the stealth system. It appears in previous Cods you had no option to stealth a level all the way through and you could go back to stealth after you pass a certain part of the level if they catch you. Other times if you get caught you have the restart the level. In this game you can creep all the way through and if you get caught, everyone knows where you are. You can finish the level loud if you choose too. There's one section of forced stealth but that's it and it's for a good reason (play the game and find out). Even though it's only done once there's a level that requires you to cover a teammate. Basically, shooting at a bunker causes it to stop firing at your teammates and you order them to move up as you're covering them. I wish they do this with future Cods. That level with the tank I talked about earlier? You must destroy it by placing bombs on it while fighting off enemies. These are cool RPG-like elements they added to a generally linear-style game and it's fantastic. There's also a level where you need to memorize response and give them back to people which is cool.Verdict: If you like Cod or think it's a hit/miss you'll most likely enjoy it. The people complaining about the game are mostly idiots. The game has some glaring issues especially in MP with the framerate and some of the bugs in the story, but both are fantastic and worth $60. Worst case, pick this up when it goes on sale it will be worth it."

												Overall a good campaign, even if you get swarmed by Germans with shotguns firing incendiary shells which were definitely standard issue at the time ;)Edit; Your AI allies are completely incapable of shooting anything and seem to let Germans run right up to you, making the hardest difficulty all fun and games."

												It's... Okay. It's fine. It's not a baaaad game, but there are a lot of issues with it. (1.7 hours in campaign + 63 hours multiplayer)Personally, I think the reason I liked Sledgehammer so much was Advanced Warfare. It was nice to have a developer no one knew come out of the blue and change up the COD formula by completely revamping the movement system. It made what was once a stale series for many feel fresh again. It was the reason a lot of my friends ended up getting back in to COD. It was also a big reason a lot of people stopped. A lot of people didn't like the movement system. A lot of console players in particular thought it was too hard to keep track of people. So Treyarch refined the dash-movement system by changing it in to a soft jet jump and adding wall runs. This, combined with the boost slides, made Black Ops 3 in to an incredibly deep game in movement and in combat. It was what kept me glued to the game for years. Infinite Warfare changed the movement a little bit, but mostly kept things the same. Infinite Warfare had issues with the loot drop system and weapon/scorestreak variants but as a game it was still a blast. Then comes WWII. I had really high hopes for this game. And after years of jet jumping around, I was completely on board with the idea of a boots-on-ground COD to mix up the game for a while, maybe make things feel fresh again. And after 65~ hours of WWII I can confidently say I miss the advanced movement. I forgot how much I hated running out of stamina. I forgot how slow COD used to be. At first, I was in the honeymoon phase with this game. All of the changes felt refreshing, and a return to the series' roots. But the more I messed around with it, the more I grew tired of the changes. My frustration levels were much higher with this game than they ever were in BO3 or IW. I went from feeling like a free running beast to a dirty soldier with asthma. The divisions are a cute concept but they greatly limit the level of class customization options available in previous titles. At first I was on board with the idea of reducing the level of perks in the game and pairing them up with useful complimentary perks to reduce the number of OP perk loadouts. But for me it just ended up making customization feel limited and stale. This one completely boils down to preference but I really don't like the weapon selection in this game. For the most part they're classic WWII weapons, but after playing BO3 and IW where every gun feels completely unique, this just doesn't feel fun. I look at the weapon selection list and there isn't a single gun that jumps out at me. It's a shame when even the M1 Garand doesn't feel satisfying. Y'know, arguably the most iconic weapon of WWII. None of the weapon sounds are very ""meaty"" either. None of them are bad, but none of them pack much of a punch. And the bugs. Oh lord the bugs. I have never played a COD in my life that launched in such a broken state. Parties being broken up upon finishing a game, dropping connection at the end of a match and losing all of your XP, Heroic weapon skins resetting the weapon slot after every game, laugh-out-loud potg slow mo, failing to deliver cases, being stuck in lobby limbo with a ""1"" above your head, FOV resets, full screen resets, the ""Welcome to HQ"" bug, and the list goes on. It feels like this game launched way too early and it blows my mind they screwed it up this badly. I'm sure it's easier said than done to fix all of these bugs, but a game with this many problems deserves a delay. It would have been better for everybody. At the end of the day I personally can't recommend this game. Between the stale customization, gunplay and insane level of bugs you're better off spending your time and money playing a better game. This was the game I thought I wanted, but quickly found out some things are better left in the past. If you hated the advanced movement of BO3 and love WWII weapons, this may be a solid game for you. But for me? I guess here's to 3 years of Black Ops 3."

It's call of duty, it plays like call of duty, it has a good campaign, and multiplayer has been fun without people flying through the air left and right like the last couple of games. Sure, fine, the weapons aren't named properly. Who cares? Past games have had guns with different names as well. I haven't had the lag issues or spawn camping issues others have. I am 10 hours in and it has me interested still into trying out all the weapons. I'd recommend giving it a chance."

												People have been very critical of this game for it's historical inaccuracies, especially in Multiplayer. I think this judgement is a little unfair. I don't see the Multiplayer in this game as trying to realistically portray ww2. The game reminds me of the sort of glorified exaggeration of war like you would see in an 80's action film. It's just a base setting, and made to be fun, not accurate. The Multiplayer is satisfying and solid. The gunplay reminds me of the first Black-Ops which was my first and last COD experience until now. With the weapons, the semi-auto rifles feel awkward to use when up against fully automatic weapons and sniper rifles. There aren't enough maps with Medium or Long ranges, with sufficient cover to make the Semi-Autos properly effective, because they're either outclassed by SMGs in close quarters, and Snipers in long ranges in open fields. But this can be improved with different maps down the line. Out of the modes, TDM is always a good standard, but War is a little weird. The maps feel a bit too small and congested. Gridiron and Capture the Flag are also awesomely fun (if you can find a server in your region, I'm in Australia.)Note: I've had problems with loading times in Matchmaking ques and the COD service crashing, leading to an Error popup and the Main Menu. This is very frustrating and annoying, but I take it as the growing pains of a very popular game with a stong online-side. If you don't want to deal with problem, I'd wait until for a few weeks to a month.The extras like the HQ, Orders, Challenges and the HQ mini games and visual customization make all the difference to feeling like you're a part of something bigger and that your character can progress.I've played the first level of the Singleplayer, and it doesn't seem like anything special. As an old fan of Brothers in Arms, it pales in comparison. Don't buy the game for it.The Zombies mode in this iteration of COD is going for a more spooky, horror like setting unlike the silliness of previous COD: Zombie games. I've only tried the small, house map by myself and so far it looks solid. Hoping to find three people to play the larger, more extensive map with."

												First I want to address the flaws people have pointed out about this game. Many people have complained about bad optimization, and simply not being able to run the game, though the entirety of my friends, and myself, are able to run this game perfectly fine. People complaining either need to upgrade their computers, or update their drivers-problem solved. The next issue is historical accuraccy. The only thing historically inaccruate about this game is the Nazis in the beginning who tote SVTs and PPShs. YES, i will admit this is histroically inaccruate, but aside from this one detail, is there really anything else hugely inaccurate about the game? Now before you answer that question, most of the inaccuraccies you've heard about are in Multiplayer mode, where historical accuraccy is not supposed to be taken into consideration. SHG(Sledge Hammer Games) wanted multiplayer to be a fun environment for everyone, and to achieve this, they had to sacrfice historical accruaccy. That is why in the game CODWW2, you are able to play as a black women if you want, but only in multiplayer mode, not in campaign. Basically what im saying is stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing about historical inaccuracies, cuz campaign doesn't have any(aside from nazis with ppsh and svt), multiplayer has historical inaccuracies, but only for good reason.The rest of my review is going to simply state how i feel about the game as a whole.      Campaign is just hands down amazing. Very loud action-packed, and although they don't do the best at developing the characters, I still felt bad when they killed some of them off.      Zombies is also extremely fun. This time around, its a truely scary experience, which is something I've never felt from a COD game. They have also set up their zombies mode to have a very good story that I look forward to playing through once the new zombies maps drop. Lastly, they've made zombies more objective based, as you always have something you're doing in order to achieve a great goal (beat the easter egg).     Multiplayer is ok so far, sometimes it can be really fun and sometimes it can suck. It almost feels like if you are not winning, then you are not having fun at all. My ratings:Campaign: 10/10Zombies: 9/10Multiplayer 6/10Overall:  5/6"

												System Specs: i7 4790kGTX 97016GB RAMWindows 10Run on all high with 80-100fps-----------------------I beat the campaign in a little over 4 hours. I have sunk an additional 3 hours into multiplayer so far. As for the campaign I thought they did a great job on getting a realistic feel of being a soldier in WW2. I enjoyed the way that they slow the story down at parts and have you simply walking around lively bases and camps doing a simple everyday task of moving ammo someplace or getting someone a meal. It really lets you immerse and look around at all the different sights and feels. Many will think the story itself is cliche and of course it is at times. Overall the story really grabbed me and I developed feelings for most of the characters. That alone makes me believe that this story was a good one. As for the multiplayer I'm just happy that we get another boots on the ground CoD. Nothing extravagant is going to change with the multiplayer. It feels and plays just like you remember it from any other run and gun CoD. I will say that I'm very very pleased with the new Headquarters area they added. It's just another thing that you're able to immerse youself in and it runs beautifully. I recommend looking into the Headquarters area if you don't know what I'm talking about. About an hour of my multiplayer time has gone into Nazi Zombies. Zombies at first will take you by surprise, It's not like it was back in World at War. However, It's not bad. It's very unique and fresh and I had a great time running around and seeing all the new things they added such as power ups and different zombie types. Not to mention the amazing in depth secrets you get to explore and find in any new Nazi Zombies map. In conclusion, I would say that if you're a fan of the WW2 theme and boots on the ground CoD in general I think you will enjoy this. If you are scrolling through the miles of negative reviews and somehow stop to read all of what I'm saying... for one thank you I'm flattered, but seriously go into this CoD with an open mind and take it for what it is. I think many people lack the ability to do so. It's really unfortunate. I hope I can help anyone out. Thanks for reading."

												Wow. A campaign that actually has interesting characters and makes you feel something for them. A big step up for COD. But the formula for COD is still one that is been thrashed over the years and is still very familiar. I could have respected a little more realism at times. The ridiculously fast car chases felt so out of place in a WW2 setting IMO. Low res textures in places were off-putting. Complete lack of mouth movement on characters during conversations looked just weird. And when they did work it looked like they were mumbling. Other than that this game ran perfect with no issues. Just not worth the big price tag for someone like myself who has no interest in the multiplayer or zombies. I have to say though, that it lookes like they put a lot more effort into the recent COD games than this one as far as nice looking graphics go. It felt like a step backwards if only by a small margin.All in all... One of my favorite campaign stories since Modern Warfare."

												It's a good game. The story for campaign is engaging and interesting, and multiplayer (despite having a bit of a hurdle when first joining, cause of unlocking weapons and such) is perfectly fine, and I personally, have had zero issues with connectivity to servers. (in either single OR multiplayer)In regards to the story itself:If you're looking for a historic account of WWII then go watch a documentary. This is a game, and it does what it set out to do well, imo, but it is not a direct representation of what WWII or even the time period were actually like. It's a snapshot from a few days in the life of a single soldier. If you get this expecting it to be an exact retelling of WWII, from the speech patterns of the people right down to the EXACT way guns interact with the environment and enemies (regardless of how those things would effect the game's actual balance) then you are plainly, and simply doing it wrong and expecting too much."

												-By far very fun multiplayer and zombies experience, singleplayer is very good but a bit short as they could make more missions just to have even more fun in it.-20.000-45.000 people at a day on multiplayer is a showcase that this cod has some potential.In my total 50+hrs on multiplayer i have seen 0 hackers. Yeah they exsist but it is my luck or just small amount of hackers. Good thing is that you get supply drops for free, you play the game and complete orders taken from the headquarters and so you can get armory points,XP boosts for guns,divisions or level and rare or common supply drops which is great, you can also get them from random 'jackpot' at the end of the match from 0 up to 3 player can get a supply drop. Server connections..you were been waiting for this right? So lets say that 70% of the player has issues with connection. Thats bad but there is a lot of players at servers especially at the release date so that means the game is popular, ofcourse they will fix this thing but I just dont have any issues except low fps and lags on some bigger maps because i have potato PC.. So 8/10 for multiplayer, they can make it better with future updates so lets hope.-Zombies. Hell yeah, very good zombies in this game. The main easter egg has 'tutorial' - it says what you need to do so you just follow steps and you will be fine with it, by main easter egg with a boss there are other secrets on the final reich zombies map as building 4 different tesla guns. In my opinion treyarch's zombies are better because I got used to them in 3 black ops games, we all loved the maps, the points system,the perks and surviving 100+ rounds ofc. Here you barely can survive 50+ rounds because hell my lord zombie 'little' bosses are so strong at later rounds and you just dont have any wonder weapons except underpowered tesla gun at later rounds. There are blitz machines instead of perks, jolts instead of points and shovel instead of a melee knife :). So after 10+ hrs into zombies i think they are good but not better than treyarch zombies, overall 8/10.-Singleplayer is a bit short as I said but the characters around you feel like your real buddies and there is no health regeneration. 9/10 for singleplayer, the only bad thing is length.Hope you enjoyed my review thanks for reading and if you buy WW2, have fun in it!"

												Refund requested. The request reads as follows, I thin it serves as a good review as well. ""This game is completely and utterly broken. I have spent a considerable amount of time on it, yes, but most of it was a struggle between constant lag, framerate drops on my high-end PC, getting disconnected from lobbies after wins and forfeiting the credit towards held Orders, and now the nail in the coffin - a game-breaking glitch that has left my game in a state of unplayability. The game recognizes my account as a new player, and as such I am forced to complete an uncompleteable introduction to headquarters, which also prevents me from picking up orders or contracts and completing them. This, along with the laundry list of other issues, warrants a complete refund in my opinion- especially in the climate we find ourselves in as gamers, where developers feed us half-baked games for full price. $64.00 isn't cheap by any stretch, and as an adult who works hard for his money, I genuinely feel that I have been scammed into buying a broken game by Activision. I am utterly disappointed with my experience thus far. I have made attempts to contact both Activision and Sledgehammer games, and neither of their customer support lines are operational at this time (it says so on their websites, have a look.) I assume they anticipate the negative feedback and wish to spare themselves of the embarassment and guilt that they so deserve.This is $64.00 that I could put towards my rent payment for the month, but it is otherwise tied up in the form of a game that will not allow me to enjoy the full experience promised to us gamers. I may purchase the title again at a later date, when the game is fixed and I can enjoy it without ACTUALLY experiencing a war between myself and the horrible issues it has.Thank you for understanding my plight,Darth Platypus"""

The weapons are maybe a bit to balanced because almost no gun do real damage except for gun you have to camp for like LMG's.

												-By far very fun multiplayer and zombies experience, singleplayer is very good but a bit short as they could make more missions just to have even more fun in it.-20.000-45.000 people at a day on multiplayer is a showcase that this cod has some potential.In my total 50+hrs on multiplayer i have seen 0 hackers. Yeah they exsist but it is my luck or just small amount of hackers. Good thing is that you get supply drops for free, you play the game and complete orders taken from the headquarters and so you can get armory points,XP boosts for guns,divisions or level and rare or common supply drops which is great, you can also get them from random 'jackpot' at the end of the match from 0 up to 3 player can get a supply drop. Server connections..you were been waiting for this right? So lets say that 70% of the player has issues with connection. Thats bad but there is a lot of players at servers especially at the release date so that means the game is popular, ofcourse they will fix this thing but I just dont have any issues except low fps and lags on some bigger maps because i have potato PC.. So 8/10 for multiplayer, they can make it better with future updates so lets hope.-Zombies. Hell yeah, very good zombies in this game. The main easter egg has 'tutorial' - it says what you need to do so you just follow steps and you will be fine with it, by main easter egg with a boss there are other secrets on the final reich zombies map as building 4 different tesla guns. In my opinion treyarch's zombies are better because I got used to them in 3 black ops games, we all loved the maps, the points system,the perks and surviving 100+ rounds ofc. Here you barely can survive 50+ rounds because hell my lord zombie 'little' bosses are so strong at later rounds and you just dont have any wonder weapons except underpowered tesla gun at later rounds. There are blitz machines instead of perks, jolts instead of points and shovel instead of a melee knife :). So after 10+ hrs into zombies i think they are good but not better than treyarch zombies, overall 8/10.-Singleplayer is a bit short as I said but the characters around you feel like your real buddies and there is no health regeneration. 9/10 for singleplayer, the only bad thing is length.Hope you enjoyed my review thanks for reading and if you buy WW2, have fun in it!"

												Refund requested. The request reads as follows, I thin it serves as a good review as well. ""This game is completely and utterly broken. I have spent a considerable amount of time on it, yes, but most of it was a struggle between constant lag, framerate drops on my high-end PC, getting disconnected from lobbies after wins and forfeiting the credit towards held Orders, and now the nail in the coffin - a game-breaking glitch that has left my game in a state of unplayability. The game recognizes my account as a new player, and as such I am forced to complete an uncompleteable introduction to headquarters, which also prevents me from picking up orders or contracts and completing them. This, along with the laundry list of other issues, warrants a complete refund in my opinion- especially in the climate we find ourselves in as gamers, where developers feed us half-baked games for full price. $64.00 isn't cheap by any stretch, and as an adult who works hard for his money, I genuinely feel that I have been scammed into buying a broken game by Activision. I am utterly disappointed with my experience thus far. I have made attempts to contact both Activision and Sledgehammer games, and neither of their customer support lines are operational at this time (it says so on their websites, have a look.) I assume they anticipate the negative feedback and wish to spare themselves of the embarassment and guilt that they so deserve.This is $64.00 that I could put towards my rent payment for the month, but it is otherwise tied up in the form of a game that will not allow me to enjoy the full experience promised to us gamers. I may purchase the title again at a later date, when the game is fixed and I can enjoy it without ACTUALLY experiencing a war between myself and the horrible issues it has.Thank you for understanding my plight,Darth Platypus"""

												It's a good game. The story for campaign is engaging and interesting, and multiplayer (despite having a bit of a hurdle when first joining, cause of unlocking weapons and such) is perfectly fine, and I personally, have had zero issues with connectivity to servers. (in either single OR multiplayer)In regards to the story itself:If you're looking for a historic account of WWII then go watch a documentary. This is a game, and it does what it set out to do well, imo, but it is not a direct representation of what WWII or even the time period were actually like. It's a snapshot from a few days in the life of a single soldier. If you get this expecting it to be an exact retelling of WWII, from the speech patterns of the people right down to the EXACT way guns interact with the environment and enemies (regardless of how those things would effect the game's actual balance) then you are plainly, and simply doing it wrong and expecting too much."

												I took the plunge and bought this game. I don't regret it. I only regret buying the MW series but those games have their own feedback. What can I say about WW2? It's back to boots of the ground, baby! Let's get the MP out of the way first. Multiplayer - same as always. Quick reflex gameplay. The new additions of the War mode is welcoming but it requires a large number of players to make it more enjoyable. This is what Battlefield 1 is for. Nonetheless, war mode is engaging. Nazi Zombies - Same as always. Now campaign. I wish it was longer and the plot extended. Also more factions would be nice like the classic COD, 1, 2 and 3. Maybe a later COD game would feature this. The plot is very good but some of the character developments are undermined and not enough story about them and the feud between the team leader and subordinates is just too cliche. It's fine but more elaborated would be nice. The campaign has a lot of resemblance to other war games. The first mission is straight out of Medal of Honor Allied Assault/Frontline. I do like COD2 Normandy mission better than this WW2's version. The secret infiltration mission (one of the best missions I played) is also ripped from MOH Frontline. Not an issue and these missions do have their own take instead of a complete cut and paste. It also resembles the obvious Band of Brother and Brothers in Arms. It also does resemble COD2: Big Red One and COD3 in terms of having a squad and mission locales. The dogfight is a nice addition but wish there was more of it. The later missions were similar to COD UO, which is nice like Battle of the Bulge. There are some missions not featured in other COD World War Two games which is nice. The campaign is just too short, the classic COD 1, 2, and 3 were longer. The Squad Abilities is just unnecessary. I didn't like the constant availability of med kits from teammates because it makes the game too easy. Though, that teammate of yours is not always around because of plot and is good, you have to find medkits around the field. I do like the return to health bar! I love some of the new small features like dragging teammates when they're down. This is something similar to Bros Mode in Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway but it was completely removed from that game. It could have made BIAHH more immersive. Also your teammates sometimes get into trouble with the enemies is very natural and less scripted and it's nice to help them out. It makes it more immersive experience. Speaking of immersive, the graphics is phenomenal. Best graphics I have seen but there are stuttering issues. I still prefer the squad dynamics and story of COD2 Big Red One and COD3 but this game isn't so bad. It is missing out quite a bit overall, reminds me of the new Star Wars Battlefront 1. Overall, I think it's a good package and to be honest, I bought this game for SP and it did not disappoint. Sure it could be better but it's nice reboot to the whole MW and BO series. I give this game 8/10. Is it worth $80? No but that's the price tag these days for triple A games."

												Feels very unoptimized.. Not worth $60 in its current state. I'd wait till it's all hopefully ironed out then it'll be a pretty good game.**NOTE HOURS SHOWN ARE ONLY SINGLE PLAYER HOURS!! I'VE PLAYED FAR MORE ON MULTIPLAYER AND ZOMBIES!**EDIT!: Now after a few days passed and a few fixes went out I'll update my review. Cons:  x/10 how annoying/ how niceHave had a few crashes / server issues.. not horrible though 6/10Settings graphics settings changing on their own and different settings between gametypes 3/10Hit reg/weapon+map balancing 6/10 bad but not as bad as I feel some people make it seemMaps (amount) 7/10 Not enough maps.. pretty ticked they had dlc maps since day one when war only has 3 maps total..Pros:Single player is FANTASTIC! Solid 9/10 Really enjoying it so far. Best of all the cod's I've played(Quick note I didn't finish the story mode, so this is just on how much fun I had/ how well done I feel they did, not length of time played)Zombies 8/10 Man they really captured how I want zombies to feel, Not personally a fan of the classes and all the extra stuff they added but not counting that as a negitive. The problem with zombies is already listed above as a con, if your host disconnects (from server issues) the whole lobby drops and you lose the hour(s) of gameplay. Not a great single player zombie map, but still fun!!Mutliplayer.. Honestly I'm not sure how to rate this, I find it enjoyable.. but the above cons really but a damper on the experience.If they could fix JUST hit reg and server issues, I'd give the mutliplayer 6.5-7/10. I really don't think it's anything special, War is a lot of fun.. but there are other games out there that do it better.. *cough battlefield*~~~All in all I think this is a pretty good game, I CANNOT see 60/100 usd being worth it, but that's up for you to decide! If you can handle the issues grab it because it's fun and I intend to keep playing, just bummed at the price tag.~~~"

												As someone who has been pretty harsh on COD games (such as infinite warfare) I think this game is the step in the right direction. Pros:-set in wwII-Slower paced gameplay-realistic gunplay and rankup-War Gamemode. My favorite new feature which I play 85% of the time-zombies is enjoyable as usual-campaign is a decent length - campaign overall is solid- for a cod game, guns and setpeices are accurateCons:- censorship in multiplayer (swastika)- women are playable characters -the interface can be confusing-cliches in the single player (you disobeyed orders, talking about your girl before a battle,etc.)-Frequent fps drops (I have a GTX 970, i5 7600k, 16 gigs of RAM)- some weapon classes aren't very fun or useful (support class in the beggining and expeditionary) Overall, cod is getting better. If there is any fixes they can make now, please fix the frequent for drops. Other than that let's hope for the best."

												Despite its short campaign, it delivers a satisfying story with out of this world graphics and beautiful enviroment. Not the most historically accurate WW2 game but there are many historic moments that is nailed like the invasion of Omaha Beach and the battle of Berlin. The campaign focuses a lot on the horrors of war as well as the jewish genocide. Cons is of course also a thing. There's some minor sound stuttering which gets really fricking annoying. MULTIPLAYER:The multiplayer is the most fun multiplayer since 2012's Black Ops 2. It's finally boots on the ground and without all of the exo boost poop (I won't lie, some of the exo stuff was actually fun). The hub is a really welcome addition to the multiplayer, which is a cool new way to wait inbetween matches. The fact that you can watch other people open lootboxes is awesome and kinda silly. But of course the biggest con is the connection and the weapon balance."

Oh and the hitboxes are a total fail.In typical CoD style the weapons, that in real life are absolute beasts, are now useless tampon throwers.Try the zoom with a sniper rifle, you'll laugh at how super crappy it zooms and just the appearance sucks. One more time; AUDIO AUDIO AUDIO AUDIO. No impact sounds when you get hit, you just die. No bullets whizzing past you when you get shot at. Footsteps are a total mess.I could go on but I wont because I really hoped this would be epic.

												Note: I'm going to talk about my experience with CoD then go on to my feelings about the game. Yes, they are shortened and lack a lot of substance but I don't care. The same with my spelling. A TL:DR version at the bottomI don't buy CoD every year, but I bought it this year because they were going back to WWII, they were changing the perks, they were changing the class system, they were making a new game they said was revolutionary. This game could have been great, this game could have been good. The developers at Treyarch, Infinity Ward, and Sledgehammer are great and can make great games, but this game is a disappointment. The campaign is every WWII movie's best moments compilation. The characters are underdeveloped and cliche. The story has a twist but the twist comes too late and is done poorly. There are many missed opportunities in the campaign too. For example there is a mission where you meet an african-american soldier, your squadmate distrusts him at first because it's 1944 (It was the battle of the bulge), but later says he is sorry for being a racist. This could have been done much better. The campaign is very linear. This is shown through gameplay. In one mission there is a turret where in many games you could kill the gunner, but in CoD WWII, if you shoot a rocket at the gunner the rocket will suddently change direction and fly upwards. I understand the missions and objectives being linear, but allow us to complete the objectives or missions the way we want to. The game also leaves behind it's realistic roots and goes for the more bombastic approach. You see bodies fly from burning landing craft in the begining of the first mission and later in the same mission one-shot germans with a 1911 while dragging a fallen comrade through the dirt. Also, this is a personal thing, but the characters are stupid. A german knocks you down and then your buddy distracts him, but you, the one with the 1911, sit and watch. Also your buddy could've just shot the guy because it is revealed that he has a gun too. The campaign was sloppy for a single-player experience, but mediocre for a CoD campaign. The multiplayer is where I feel somewhat ok with the things they have done. It is a multiplayer FPS, not a BBC documetary, you can have some black people or even women in your game. I also understand the removal of Nazi imagery. As I said it is a game, and Activision is a company. The game is fine, the gameplay isn't as tight as I hoped but it will do. The addition of war is welcomed but it needs more players, I would love to see a 9vs9 war mode. The place where the multiplayer goes wrong, is the headquarters. The headquarters is ripped straight from the equally disappointing and mediocre game, Destiny. In the headquarters, you get rewarded if you watch others open supply drops. The supply drops are good for supply drops. They allow you to get some of the things you want and are only cosmetic. The part where they go wrong is the fact that the only innovation in this game is coming from supply drops. This is only innovation because now you can watch others open thier ""amazing"" pistol grips and calling cards. The zombies is fine I have no complaints about it. Treyarch still does zombies best.Overall  the game is mediocre and shines a lot on the state of CoD. The fact they can take out the only innovation in the CoD games for years (Exo movement) and leave the space empty and sell millions more copies confuses me. I would not buy this game if you are looking at anything that is unique, or innovative. I bought this game on a whim and it is an example of something I did on a whim and regreted. I play it when I don't want to think, but if you need one of those games pick up Abzu. If you want to buy this for the story, there is nothing there,  if you want to buy this for the changes, there aren't any, if you want to buy this game because you think this is anything more than average, it isn't. The game is just a signal that CoD won't change because the switch to exo-movement and back has showed them that innovating isn't needed to sell. The developers at these studios could make some great games, I would love another BO2 or World at War, or another Modern Warfare, or even another Call of Duty 2. This game marks the death of CoD in my eyes, but I hope this series can recover and be at the head of gaming for the innovation and quality it used to have. This game is a 6/10 imo.TL:DR- the game is eh. buy it if you want it, but if you want it for a good campaign, improvements, or zombies, then spend your money on a different game.Buckle your seatbelt"

												All the people that are saying its a bad game because its ""historically inacurrate"", please watch a documentary on national geoghrapic if you want to learn history from a game.In my opinion this game is one of the best COD's in a long time. Games are made to entertain people. Not to teach people about a war unless told otherwise. If you want realism, they should have made the campaign 5 hours long. This would include 4 and a half ours of you sitting on a boat, and the last 30 minutes will be you dying with a big ""GAME OVER"" screen infront of you because the chance of you surviving an actual World war would be almost 0.Im not saying that this game is flawless. im just saying dont expect a Call of Duty game to be ""Based on true events"" when they never even claimed that this was the case. If you want realism play something like arma. If you want destruction play battlefield, if you want to learn history buy a book or watch a documentary.Pro's:-Old school run and gun call of duty style without the over the top technologie-You can kill Nazi's-Nice graphics-Good story in my opinion, 8 hours of playtime if you arent exploring.-Killing Nazi's is a thing-Nice new touch of the med kits instead of bleeding out of your eyes and magically healing again-Even my mom enjoyed it. She has been F**ked at least 20 times per match according to my teammates.-Great job on the details in the game. 10/10 when it comes to models.-Headquarters was a good idea, fun way to mess with friends in a 1v1Con's-Why zussman-WHAT ARE THOSE when it comes to tank mechanics-Servers are unstable, have been kicked offline3 times in the last 20 minutes-Lack of maps, Its like selling a cheeseburger without a bun or RAW SAUSE, no Ketchup ( 1 zombie and around 6 multiplayer )-The Dutch army uniform doesnt come with Clogs as standard.-Killing Hitler isnt a thing unfortunatly.The Pro's outweigh the con's in my opinion.

												What a HUGE POS!! I was greatly looking forward to getting back to what COD was all about. I was very excited to be playing WWII again. With the advances in technology for the graphics and sounds. This game is about the worst COD EVER. I tried getting past the opening campaign on D-Day. They graphics are horrible and the  sounds the guns make is just absolutely horrible. It sounds the MP-44 make is like fire crackers going off. Also, not one gun sounds they way it actually should! It is funny to see the PPSH ( a RUSSIAN ) Sub machine gun on the Normandy beach. Morons, this was found on the EASTERN FRONT. This was not on the D-Day landings. Not to mention, no THOMPSON??????????????? HELLO MORONS, do you even know what you are doing anymore????? I refuse to go any further with this huge pos game and I WANT  MY MONEY BACK. Once again COD is a COLOSSAL FAILURE!!! The developers have no clue what they are doing anymore. The last GOOD WWII game was WORLD AT WAR, where they actually got everything right. The sounds of the guns, they way they looked in detail and the sounds of the grenads!!! I have no intention of playing multiplayer or zombis which I greatly look forward to.I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!"

												THIS IS A MULTIPLAYER REVIEWI HAVE PLAYED OVER 30 HOURS, I AM SECOND PRESTIGETo put it best, this game is just sad! We are one week in and the devs have stopped supporting the pc version. This is a good port of the game but several factors take away from that, and lead to a negative review. One, the hit detection is soooo bad. Two, there are a couple of good maps, but most of them are trash. Three, sniping on PC is incredibly over powered. In most situations, if you have good aim, a sniper is better than every other gun in the game. Four, spawns are not even close to being correct. Five, the new divisions system just takes away from customization that can make or break a game like cod. Instead of being able to customize the game to your liking, you have to fit a role when you use a division. Six, the servers as a whole are just pathetic. After every game, you either get booted to the main menu or just disconnected from your party. Seven, console is getting patches and double xp before we do (this is just unfair to the pc cummunity, we play the same game, we should recieve the same perks). Even though we dont get double xp when console does, rest assured, WE WILL GET PAID SUPPLY DROPS ON THE SAME TIMELINE. Call of Duty and Activision are just a massive joke nowadays, and tbh I played myself with this purchase. Eights, and finally, there are lots of small bugs in the game that are just careless mistakes. For example, to get reticles for a reflex sight on the STG-44 you have to get kills aiming down sights with the 4x optic. Mistakes like these show that the devs were just sloppy. It is clear to me after playing this game for a week, that this game is not a three year product. This feels like it was thrown together at the last minute to avoid another jetpack release. We are a week in and there hasnt been a patch to fix a single one of these issues. The devs said that they want to support the PC community, and after one week its easy to tell that was just a blatant lie. To the people that are still going to be playing this game in a month, enjoy spending hella cash on pay to win guns. As I said in the beginning, this game is just sad!"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. It looks fantastic, but it's a reskin. It's any other CoD game from the past five, six years. The first mission on D-Day is so melodramatic it's almost unbearable. And the damage from the guns is pitiful. If I hit you in the chest with two rounds of .30-06 ammunition, you are dead, period. And I should not have to empty a full mag of .45 ACP from a Tommy Gun to kill someone. Maybe I'm too used to playing Siege or Wildlands, but for all their vaunted historical accuracy, the game is garbage."

												Note: I'm going to talk about my experience with CoD then go on to my feelings about the game. Yes, they are shortened and lack a lot of substance but I don't care. The same with my spelling. A TL:DR version at the bottomI don't buy CoD every year, but I bought it this year because they were going back to WWII, they were changing the perks, they were changing the class system, they were making a new game they said was revolutionary. This game could have been great, this game could have been good. The developers at Treyarch, Infinity Ward, and Sledgehammer are great and can make great games, but this game is a disappointment. The campaign is every WWII movie's best moments compilation. The characters are underdeveloped and cliche. The story has a twist but the twist comes too late and is done poorly. There are many missed opportunities in the campaign too. For example there is a mission where you meet an african-american soldier, your squadmate distrusts him at first because it's 1944 (It was the battle of the bulge), but later says he is sorry for being a racist. This could have been done much better. The campaign is very linear. This is shown through gameplay. In one mission there is a turret where in many games you could kill the gunner, but in CoD WWII, if you shoot a rocket at the gunner the rocket will suddently change direction and fly upwards. I understand the missions and objectives being linear, but allow us to complete the objectives or missions the way we want to. The game also leaves behind it's realistic roots and goes for the more bombastic approach. You see bodies fly from burning landing craft in the begining of the first mission and later in the same mission one-shot germans with a 1911 while dragging a fallen comrade through the dirt. Also, this is a personal thing, but the characters are stupid. A german knocks you down and then your buddy distracts him, but you, the one with the 1911, sit and watch. Also your buddy could've just shot the guy because it is revealed that he has a gun too. The campaign was sloppy for a single-player experience, but mediocre for a CoD campaign. The multiplayer is where I feel somewhat ok with the things they have done. It is a multiplayer FPS, not a BBC documetary, you can have some black people or even women in your game. I also understand the removal of Nazi imagery. As I said it is a game, and Activision is a company. The game is fine, the gameplay isn't as tight as I hoped but it will do. The addition of war is welcomed but it needs more players, I would love to see a 9vs9 war mode. The place where the multiplayer goes wrong, is the headquarters. The headquarters is ripped straight from the equally disappointing and mediocre game, Destiny. In the headquarters, you get rewarded if you watch others open supply drops. The supply drops are good for supply drops. They allow you to get some of the things you want and are only cosmetic. The part where they go wrong is the fact that the only innovation in this game is coming from supply drops. This is only innovation because now you can watch others open thier ""amazing"" pistol grips and calling cards. The zombies is fine I have no complaints about it. Treyarch still does zombies best.Overall  the game is mediocre and shines a lot on the state of CoD. The fact they can take out the only innovation in the CoD games for years (Exo movement) and leave the space empty and sell millions more copies confuses me. I would not buy this game if you are looking at anything that is unique, or innovative. I bought this game on a whim and it is an example of something I did on a whim and regreted. I play it when I don't want to think, but if you need one of those games pick up Abzu. If you want to buy this for the story, there is nothing there,  if you want to buy this for the changes, there aren't any, if you want to buy this game because you think this is anything more than average, it isn't. The game is just a signal that CoD won't change because the switch to exo-movement and back has showed them that innovating isn't needed to sell. The developers at these studios could make some great games, I would love another BO2 or World at War, or another Modern Warfare, or even another Call of Duty 2. This game marks the death of CoD in my eyes, but I hope this series can recover and be at the head of gaming for the innovation and quality it used to have. This game is a 6/10 imo.TL:DR- the game is eh. buy it if you want it, but if you want it for a good campaign, improvements, or zombies, then spend your money on a different game.Buckle your seatbelt"

												All the people that are saying its a bad game because its ""historically inacurrate"", please watch a documentary on national geoghrapic if you want to learn history from a game.In my opinion this game is one of the best COD's in a long time. Games are made to entertain people. Not to teach people about a war unless told otherwise. If you want realism, they should have made the campaign 5 hours long. This would include 4 and a half ours of you sitting on a boat, and the last 30 minutes will be you dying with a big ""GAME OVER"" screen infront of you because the chance of you surviving an actual World war would be almost 0.Im not saying that this game is flawless. im just saying dont expect a Call of Duty game to be ""Based on true events"" when they never even claimed that this was the case. If you want realism play something like arma. If you want destruction play battlefield, if you want to learn history buy a book or watch a documentary.Pro's:-Old school run and gun call of duty style without the over the top technologie-You can kill Nazi's-Nice graphics-Good story in my opinion, 8 hours of playtime if you arent exploring.-Killing Nazi's is a thing-Nice new touch of the med kits instead of bleeding out of your eyes and magically healing again-Even my mom enjoyed it. She has been F**ked at least 20 times per match according to my teammates.-Great job on the details in the game. 10/10 when it comes to models.-Headquarters was a good idea, fun way to mess with friends in a 1v1Con's-Why zussman-WHAT ARE THOSE when it comes to tank mechanics-Servers are unstable, have been kicked offline3 times in the last 20 minutes-Lack of maps, Its like selling a cheeseburger without a bun or RAW SAUSE, no Ketchup ( 1 zombie and around 6 multiplayer )-The Dutch army uniform doesnt come with Clogs as standard.-Killing Hitler isnt a thing unfortunatly.The Pro's outweigh the con's in my opinion. I would rate this a 7,5/10"

At the end of the day, the game is a blast to play if you are just looking to have fun.

												I would give this game a solid 8/10. The campaign is incredibly fun and feels very immeesive. The multiplayer is just absolutely amazing. For once, it feels as if call of duty actually put some effort into the multiplayer. Every gun is different and every map is so well designed. The only complaint I have about the multiplayer is the performance optimization on the map gusstav cannon, but overall I enjoy the map. The main reason I gave this review an 8/10 is the zombies. I just did not enjoy the zombies at all. Yah it was quite ""spooky"", but I didn't like how it gave you all of the missions to complete. This just took the fun of zombies out of it. Like what happened to just surviving and having fun why does it have to have a bad story. Overall, I absolutely love this game and just the multiplayer is worth the 60 dollars it is."

Campaign is just plain awful random QTE buttons you never know what button it is going to be its like a lucky dip and the enemies seem have health pools as large as a boss fight empty loads of bullets into them before they die.New health mechanic is awful soon as you pop out every single enemy on the map shoots you with pinpoint precision leaving you to use medpacks more than you should have to.As for multiplayer i have been playing a lot of WAR mode and the mounted gun emplacements kill it for me and some of the maps are just plain awful to play on they seem to be tipped in one sides favour the only decent map is the snowy one with the three tanks."

												I preorderes this game and this will be the last time I preorder a game. Good game in some views but not fully done at release. The developers these days think ""let's develop an alpha and get the money from early adopters"", then they finish the game. COD  has soooo many bugs, due to console friendly development, where lies the main mistake number 1. The game feels like ""bugged mp gaming"" in early 2000s.- Crashed server at game release - MP performance problems on server 2 weeks after release- Crap menue due to console port (worst menu I have seen so far in a FPS)-Aborting mreference menues when host of a party switch gamemode or enters HQ (it's 2017 not 2010)- No team balancing- Questionable anti cheat protection- Game crashes when you report someone - they never tested this?- Several game crashes without any reason / error msg- Party member fly out of party randomly- Rounds are so ridicolous short: TDM: 75 Points? Promotion loading screen, winner loading screen, lobby loading screen, and if there is no bug that kicks you out of lobby: map loading screen. Conquest: 100 points, half time, loading screen, 100 points, Promotion loading screen, winner loading screen, lobby loading screen, and if there is no bug that kicks you out of lobby - wtf??(40h mp played so far)"

You can't even aim by nearby friendlies without having to withdraw your gun, this has gotten me killed so many times it's so annoying. The enemies take at least 6 or 5 shots to the chest to die, while you take 2 and you almost get vaporized by the germans. The campaign is historically incorrect as hell. It's like if SNL and Drunk History got together and tried to explain WW2. I didn't expect them to get so many things wrong and I don't care they did get some stuff wrong, but every mission and gun and vehicle is so ♥♥♥♥ing WRONG.

												If you’re not new to steam (or the earth for that matter) then you know that the group think can be pretty bad. That seems to be the case for this game. Everyone loves to hate on Call of Duty, and sometimes it is deservedly so. Not in this case. It is clear that they really thought about PC this year. Just look at the in game graphic adjustments! It’s akin to Wildlands where it gives you a preview of what setting does what and how it will look when you adjust it. The servers are iffy as of launch day, but that is unfortunately to be expected. Not saying it’s right or forgivable, but it’s reality. However, I have played 5 games online no problem and they have been buttery smooth. Great frame rate and all around feels good. It’s certainly not going back to United Offensive, but this feels like how CoD used to be. Fun, boots on the ground, fast paced action. Nazi zombies and campaign are both excellent from what I’ve seen as well. Zombies is actually scary. I recommend this game if you like CoD! Don’t be fooled by the group think circle jerk."

												The game is just bloody fantastic. Sure, some areas could use some improvement, but I have yet to see a game where there were no such areas. Summary is, the game is easily worth it's cost. Great look, well optimized and overall a blast to play. I would rate it a 8.5/10Pros;~Very well optimized. I get 130-110fps on 1440p maxed settings. My friend with a GTX 960 gets 60fps maxed on 1080p.~The game looks AMAZING!~Feels like you are playing a movie. The entire campaign I felt almost as if I were in Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan.~The guns are modeled excelently and sound/feel historically accurate~Multiplayer is fun, and the only microtransactions are for cosmetics, but you can easily earn the crates as well!~Probably one of the BEST Call of Duty PC ports in a long time.~Zombies are fun! Gory as can be and actually somewhat scary at times, like it should be.~Map design in MP, Campaign and Zombies are all excellent~Multiplayer Divisions act like subclasses and add more depth to the multiplayer, with perks exclusive to each oneCons;~Kinda buggy here and there, less with the gameplay and more so with the UI and loading bugs~Servers didn't work right at launch (But name one game who's servers worked perfectly at launch anyways, not an issue)~Some of the weapons could have had some more balancing done to them. Shotguns with dragonsbreath can be a little OP at range~More complicated than previous titles. The HQ thing is cool, but confusing at first. Felt like they could have left it out. Seems like they were going for a Destiny/Tower kind of thing which let's be honest, has no place in Call of Duty.Misc; Saw people complaining about these...~Women in the game. Really though, who cares. It's only in multiplayer and it is somewhat accurate as the French Resistance did have quite a few female members. Campaign is kept accurate, and that's what matters~Gay Pride flag banner in MP options. Once again, not important to the game, who cares.~Had to unpack the game even with preload. Kinda how it works people. If you don't like it so much, get an SSD. It took me less than 10 mins to unpack both."

												Campaign: This is a true breath of fresh air for the Call of Duty series. Most would agree that the developers have taken their first step into a greater future of games.A great story with an amazing end, a few glitches here and there in both zombies and Multiplayer yet still worth the money. This has been the best story after Modern Warfare 2, the game really deserves a better rating.Multiplayer:The Multiplayer section is great fun and has a moderte speed to it, the guns are amazing along with the sound affects. The killstreaks are similar to that of older games and aren't over the top like Ghosts or Advanced Warfare.Zombies:So far it seems as the game devs have chosen to appeal to both the Treyarch Zombies fans and just casual zombie players. The game lays out what to do for the main quest and tells the player more or less where to go however, for the Treyarch Zombies fans the game devs have added a second ending to the first map of the mode. To unlock this ending the player will need to hunt for secrets around the map like they did in the old Treyarch Zombies Maps. This is what zombie players are looking forward to in the future.Warning:This game does consist of a lot of bugs currently but it's not game changing, the glitches and bugs are simply just frustrating most of the time. The Zombies map doesn't have much replayablity as once you complete the main Easter Egg and the secret ending which is not too hard, The map doesn't offer much else that we currently know of. There are challenges in which are set for the player to unlock new characters but this doesn't change the game or add anything new.     This game is still great and I can't wait to see what the next map of zombies holds."

												Oh boy.. where to start.This game was majorly overhyped. Sure the graphics are good, but that is really about it.The single player campain is just Run, Shoot, Cut Scene, Repeat. You can get through the entire campain in about 4-6 hours. The guns are horrible when attempting to kill somebody, example.. a Pistol to the face takes about 2-3 shots to actually do anything (Seems legit?)Multiplayer... If you don't have a good computer, while you shouldn't even consider clicking it. A GTX 970, and GTX 1060 both had hard times running this awful game. Obviously the 1060 did better then the 970, but still was terrible performance. The gun balance is TERRIBLE, and the maps? Yeah good luck running 20 feet. You spawn, run a few feet, and you already see enemys. The map size is beyond pathetic, considering the map's we have seen in previous call of duty's."

Almost 0 tatics; just the same old run around and shoot until you die crap. First 2 servers had obvious esp/aim hacks as people sprayed headshots through smoke or the obvious snap to body crap.  Aim and running feels loppy as best; and it defiently has some auto-aim built into game. More console hangover probably.   Running at 144hz/144fps; it still feels slow to react and sluggish.Overall; great for kiddies on xbox or ps4; more then obvious its not made for PC."

												Just to be clear, I only play zombies so this review is NOT about the Campaign or Multiplayer!I was a bit scared they were going to change zombies all over again when they said they're gonna add horror game elements like for example jumpscares. But I must say they did a really... really... really good job, the map is a great map to begin with not too big and not too small. The new armor/juggernog is also a really cool new feature was a bit sceptic when I hear the completely removed Jug but after all they made it a really cool system. I like the ''special zombies'' they added (The Charger, Bomber and Flamethrower) They're not too OP and pretty easy to deal with if you know how to avoid them and shoot them at the right moment and right place on the body. I also like how they did the new special loadouts with the mods. The main casual easter egg is also a nice way to explore the map and it's pretty easy to figure out what to do (Also because they just tell you) They also show you where to do it, so if it's says enable the power it shows you where the power is, it would have been more fun if you needed to search that yourself.All the perks are in the map so you can choose which one you would like to get, so it's not the only 4 classic perks machines. I had great time playing it with my friends and many more hours of playing with them will follow!After all a great game, if you're buying this because of zombies, you won't regret it!!"

												I waited until the first patch dropped to write this review. The patch fixed some no excuse bug in game which sadly has become normal for an AAA title at launch. There are still issues with hackers occasionally, and dedicated server seems to be unstable as I'm writing this.Overall, it feels like advanced warfare without the exo and the crazy weapons, which is what I expected. Each of the 3 studios have their own style on things like map and scorestreak design, and I personally think Treyarch is the best one.Game is fun overall. Not better than BO3 in my opinion but way better than IW. I didn't run into much performance issue, despite what people keep saying that they don't care about PC community, It actually ran better than BO3 and I can get higher fps at similar settings. I think they put more effort into this PC version than what they did to Black Ops 3.  The things I don't like about sledgehammer CoDs is mainly the map design. There are simply way too many routes in most maps, which really makes you feel like you have no control since the odds of you being shot in the back is increased significantly compare to BO3. There are alreay enough people that think CoD has no skill, and this game feels even more like an arcade style. Scorestreaks are also weak, which is the same for advanced warfare."

												TL;DR: Don't even think about buying this game. It's absolute garbage, almost worthy of a Battlefield knockoff, but costs the same with roughly 1/3 of the gameplay available.I've been playing CoD since I was 7. I'm now 23. I played the original CoD, Big Red One, CoD2, CoD3, MWF, MW2, Black ops, etc. etc. I stopped playing after MW3/Black ops 2. The multiplayer experience was getting less and less fun because the games were turning into a pray n spray gamestyle that required little to no skill. This game is the pinnacle of that playstyle. I really hoped the developers would go back to their roots with this, but sadly that's not the case. Aside from the gameplay, there are countless bugs, a season pass that suckers you into spending more money on this trash game, and cosmetic distractions that take away from the absolute atrocity that is CoDWW2.For every person that buys this game, a child dies of starvation. Be a good person. Don't buy Call of Duty World War 2."

												I love this game the campain was excellent... until ""collateral damage"". I have never hated something so much in my life. Im not sure if its the way my stuff is set up or what but the tank controls are the worst i have ever seen. Hitting ""w"" to go forward should move the front forward and ""S"" backwards. Why is there a need for it to want to go in the direction of where you are looking and slow everything down. Its great that there are two tanks to go against that move perfectly though. Its borderline impossible to look around fast enough to know where you are going to evade/attack the tanks. Also good luck if you round a corner and its staring you in the face because you will never get away in time. If i could skip this level intirely to get back to the good campaign i would."

												Campaign: This is a true breath of fresh air for the Call of Duty series. Most would agree that the developers have taken their first step into a greater future of games.A great story with an amazing end, a few glitches here and there in both zombies and Multiplayer yet still worth the money. This has been the best story after Modern Warfare 2, the game really deserves a better rating.Multiplayer:The Multiplayer section is great fun and has a moderte speed to it, the guns are amazing along with the sound affects. The killstreaks are similar to that of older games and aren't over the top like Ghosts or Advanced Warfare.Zombies:So far it seems as the game devs have chosen to appeal to both the Treyarch Zombies fans and just casual zombie players. The game lays out what to do for the main quest and tells the player more or less where to go however, for the Treyarch Zombies fans the game devs have added a second ending to the first map of the mode. To unlock this ending the player will need to hunt for secrets around the map like they did in the old Treyarch Zombies Maps. This is what zombie players are looking forward to in the future.Warning:This game does consist of a lot of bugs currently but it's not game changing, the glitches and bugs are simply just frustrating most of the time. The Zombies map doesn't have much replayablity as once you complete the main Easter Egg and the secret ending which is not too hard, The map doesn't offer much else that we currently know of. There are challenges in which are set for the player to unlock new characters but this doesn't change the game or add anything new.     This game is still great and I can't wait to see what the next map of zombies holds."

												Oh boy.. where to start.This game was majorly overhyped. Sure the graphics are good, but that is really about it.The single player campain is just Run, Shoot, Cut Scene, Repeat. You can get through the entire campain in about 4-6 hours. The guns are horrible when attempting to kill somebody, example.. a Pistol to the face takes about 2-3 shots to actually do anything (Seems legit?)Multiplayer... If you don't have a good computer, while you shouldn't even consider clicking it. A GTX 970, and GTX 1060 both had hard times running this awful game. Obviously the 1060 did better then the 970, but still was terrible performance. The gun balance is TERRIBLE, and the maps? Yeah good luck running 20 feet. You spawn, run a few feet, and you already see enemys. The map size is beyond pathetic, considering the map's we have seen in previous call of duty's."

												Just to be clear, I only play zombies so this review is NOT about the Campaign or Multiplayer!I was a bit scared they were going to change zombies all over again when they said they're gonna add horror game elements like for example jumpscares. But I must say they did a really... really... really good job, the map is a great map to begin with not too big and not too small. The new armor/juggernog is also a really cool new feature was a bit sceptic when I hear the completely removed Jug but after all they made it a really cool system. I like the ''special zombies'' they added (The Charger, Bomber and Flamethrower) They're not too OP and pretty easy to deal with if you know how to avoid them and shoot them at the right moment and right place on the body. I also like how they did the new special loadouts with the mods. The main casual easter egg is also a nice way to explore the map and it's pretty easy to figure out what to do (Also because they just tell you) They also show you where to do it, so if it's says enable the power it shows you where the power is, it would have been more fun if you needed to search that yourself.All the perks are in the map so you can choose which one you would like to get, so it's not the only 4 classic perks machines. I had great time playing it with my friends and many more hours of playing with them will follow!After all a great game, if you're buying this because of zombies, you won't regret it!!"

												This will be my 1st review oficially.Normally I don't even bother to write reviews but I believe this game deserves it!I quite enjoyed the BETA so I thought I'd give it a try. Eventually I bought the game and it proved to be below my expectations. Normally I focus on Multiplayer which seemed fine in BETA,however the server issues encountered after the release completeley turned me off!!! What is the point of playing with delay?? Please Sledgehammer fix your damn servers!The problem seems to be centered on players being paired to play with others across the world. I'm playing from South East Asia and it's completely impossible to get a GREEN latency in game. I refuse to believe there is no one else playing from SEA. I would suggest to introduce the Zones again in matchmaking and give players the option to select which Zone they want to play in,otherwise it's just not fair at all!

												I waited until the first patch dropped to write this review. The patch fixed some no excuse bug in game which sadly has become normal for an AAA title at launch. There are still issues with hackers occasionally, and dedicated server seems to be unstable as I'm writing this.Overall, it feels like advanced warfare without the exo and the crazy weapons, which is what I expected. Each of the 3 studios have their own style on things like map and scorestreak design, and I personally think Treyarch is the best one.Game is fun overall. Not better than BO3 in my opinion but way better than IW. I didn't run into much performance issue, despite what people keep saying that they don't care about PC community, It actually ran better than BO3 and I can get higher fps at similar settings. I think they put more effort into this PC version than what they did to Black Ops 3.  The things I don't like about sledgehammer CoDs is mainly the map design. There are simply way too many routes in most maps, which really makes you feel like you have no control since the odds of you being shot in the back is increased significantly compare to BO3. There are alreay enough people that think CoD has no skill, and this game feels even more like an arcade style. Scorestreaks are also weak, which is the same for advanced warfare."

												I have played most of the call of duty games since Finest Hour on the OG Xbox and pretty much the franchise has gone down hill over time. This feel like a breath of fresher air. The zombie is phenomenal, I couldnt stop playing the campaign so I did in one sitting. I haven't have much MP experience but from the few game I have done I enjoyed."

												This is a review of the campaign only.It's not on the same level as 2004 era CoDs, however it is a good campaign. There are a few historical innacuracies here and there and it's still a little bit micheal bayish, but it's good overall. It's fairly immersive, Germans will often surrender if all hope seems lost for them, and I even saw a german officer shoot a fellow soldier whio was trying to surrender before killing himself, and these are random occurances, not simply scripted events.Also the sounds need to be rebalanced, you can hardly hear the iconic WW2 ambient noise, and voices are far too loud, even louder than tanks.MG42 needs a bit higher ROF although it's not insanly slow.Also people will claim it's unrealistic because of the PPSHs at Omaha beach, however the defenders on many parts of the beach were from OST battalions, many were Russian POWs pressed into german service, so this is actually a very nice detail.It's a solid WW2 campaign, but never was going to replace CoD 1-2-BRR etc.Also no regen hrealth, you ask allies for aid kits and ammo, very nice bois.Better than finest hour, not as good as CoD2, but could be with more modability and tweaks."

												It's great if you haven't played a COD in few years. I'm having way more fun than in Destiny 2 which died after one(!) week of playing. However there are  too few multiplayer maps, they are bit too similar and lack variety. It is obvious Activision is blackmailing people to get their season passes which costs the same as a new game. Take that as you will, this is exactly what is wrong with the western gaming in 2017. Unfair business practices all over the place and every big publisher has jumped in on the same bandwagon. I will not recommend a single game until something changes.Other than that, game looks pretty nice especially with a custom reshade setup and it still has the same very smooth arcadey gameplay which is addictive and rage inducing at times."

I have not tried zombies yet as I have been enthralled by the multiplayer and the campaign. I have yet to have a crash, i get 80 fps.

												I'm torn... I really am...While the single player delivers a somewhat nice experience, at least when compared to other COD games, and the zombie mode being a ton of fun, it still feels like something is missing. The multiplayer mode, which I used to play a ton back in the old days, just seem lackluster. I can't really pinpoint the exact reason why it feels like this but I think there's just something about the guns and the maps that just doesn't feel right. I'm going to leave this review as a recommended BUT ONLY if you would like to play the zombies mode or the single player experience, however I would heavily recommend to wait for a discount (although this is a COD game so that will probably not happen for the next 200 years)."

												Honestly this is my favorite multiplayer Call Of Duty. No matter what all the PC gamers think about Cod while they of course trash talk this game about how ""ooh my graphics card doesn't support this or that"" Man learn how to use a computer and update it maybe even upgrade your PC. What an idea, and think about giving a negative reveiw to game first day it comes out. Don't judge a book by its cover or a game after you had like 15 min to play it. Not gonna say I played it too much yet either, But I'm sure as hell gonna give it a positive reveiw.Thx COD for changing things up even though most people don't know how."

												Call of Duty WW2, is a really good game. It has a amazing campaign with, for the most part, a historically accurate background. Some may ask, and complain about how the germans had SVT 40's, and PPSH's. Which is correct, During the Molotov-Ribbontrop Pact, Germany did do arms deals. You can google it for about 20 seconds, and see that 90% of the reviews saying it isnt historically accurate is wrong.Pros:-Capativating characters-Stunning Graphics-Great long, and content rich missions-Seeing different roles, For example, being a Woman in the French resistance, a Tanker, and a P-47 Pilot.-Good Gun-playCons:-Optimization, I hope this will be fixed throughout patches and fixes-Dead accurate emenies, Seriously these nazis are damn navy seals-Tank, and plane controls could be improved.-Cutscene Ultrawide support, Probably wont happen, but one could hope.To conclude, I hate seeing reviews, saying,  ""oh this game has a bad multiplater"" or ""I'd rather play the cod games from the 90's"" , or ""Campaign missions are too short"". Or even people giving it a negative review based on the fact that the tank mechanics are bad. Thats like saying, ""I have a Rolls Royce, but im gonna hate it because i have to put gas in it."" This game has suprised me. I am coming from the group of people who have hated the last couple of Call of Duty games. For them to go back to their roots, and truly let people experience World War 2 through a grunt, is really amazing. I would ignore most reviews that are going to come out for the next couple of weeks. Because most of them have, about 10, to 40 minutes in the game. And if you were to consider the game, keep in mind its optimization that will be fixed in the future, and always take in the reviews that have about 5 hours and above, becuase they have a little more experience with the game."

												So far, this game is lovely and i'm enjoying itI honestly don't see the reason why it's getting hateThe negative reviews on this almost made me not buy it, but i did anyway and i can tell you it's all just the cod hate train ~~~~~~Pros:Surprisingly, the online community is very friendly and helpful, especially in headquarters. For a second i thought i wasn't playing cod because there weren't squeekers and kids screaming every 5 seconds, or people saying you're hacking or something dumb, but there is the occasional ""my team sucks"" (this might change around christmas or something when all the kids get COD and then it might be like every other call of duty and turn back into a cancerous community, but as of now i love the friendliness right now)I think the graphics are okay, they aren't bad in my opinion but they aren't the best, but i'm more worried about gameplay.The way the weapons work are decent, people say the guns have no recoil but they do? so i'm confused because the M1 garand is all over the place, and even more so when you're shot at.The way the maps are set up are great, constant fast paced action, and some of the maps are bigTHIS ONE IS A BIG ONE!!! there aren't any quickscopers everywhere, or people rushing with snipers. Granted there's maybe one or 2, but it's not like people are running everywhere with it so that's amazing!Weapon customization is okay, just COD Stuff.The campaign is okay, it's not going to be a story that i'll remember or have nostalgia overThe intro when you start the game is amazing! Gives you a sense of how epic and amazing the men that fought in WW2 were.~~~~~~Cons :Honestly i'm trying to think of some...Well, i don't particularly care for the fact that swastikas and stuff like that are gone and censored. It removes the immersion a bit and you don't get the full effect of how bad Germans were during WW2 and how devastating everything was.Idk why, but there's women running around, and it seems like 3-4 out of 10 people are females in the game, kinda also ruins the immersion a bit because the war was fought by 98-99% men, women just produced and manufactored supplies such as guns, tanks, and planes ETC, not by fighting.It's doesn't really give you the vibe, and doesn't give you quite the entertainment and authenticity that world at war gave.The voice acting honestly sucks, i don't know how long i've actually played so far, but there doesn't seem to be accents of peoples nationality, like germans don't sound like germans and etc.I may be wrong.I loathe and despise the Liberal and P.C B.S that's been implemented in this game, it's so very sad.I wish all theatres of war were in this game, hopefully but i doubt it, they will be soon.~~~~~~~If i find any more pros or cons, i'll list them here.Honestly i think this is a big step in the right direction, i love that they're coming back to boots on the ground fighting and not space age junk.The last COD I bought and played was Black ops 1 and i loved it!Hopefully they'll either remaster that or make another Cold war era COD!~EDIT11-6-17Didn't take long for squeekers and quickscopers to start playing...played 5 matches today and everyone i played had quickscopers running aroundit's quickscope simulator 2018 now...and kids screaming all the time.It's now officially your typical cod fanbase again.All the friendly people are gone and everyone is hostile and hateful like all the others.Shame"

												Call of Duty WWII:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Operation Overlord was the biggest amphibian military assault ever launched. It occurred on the 6th of June 1944 on several beaches in the North of France; its purpose was to liberate France and most importantly to march deep into Germany to end the Second World War. Jump into the shoes of one of these incredible men who were right in the thick of it. Private, this is your call of duty in WWII.Call of Duty WWII is primarily an online multiplayer game. However, players can experience a single player campaign mode and a zombie mode part of the experience.Let me say it up front . . . I was an addict of this franchise up to Black Ops. I purchased every game since, but was disappointed with the outcome. Then Call of Duty WWII came out. It is a delight to see Call of Duty coming back to its source. Firstly, I would like to talk about the single player missions. WOW. . . Just WOW! As far as I am concerned this is probably one off the best WWII campaigns I have had the pleasure of playing.  You’ll play Daniel, and follow him from the invasion of Normandy until the conclusion of WWII. I personally enjoyed all the cut-scenes and missions in this game. To be totally honest with you, it’s just brilliant! The online side of the equation is great with plenty of different modes of play: domination, free for all, capture the flags, team deathmatch and more. Play with and against up to twelve people in small, well- designed maps. You can select soldiers from four of the divisions available to you: airborne, infantry, armored and expeditionary. Each of them will have they own type of weapons. For example, airborne will be loaded with sub-machine guns and expeditionary with a sniper rifle. The good news is that you can change and upgrade your weaponry each time you manage to reach a specific level. Also, you have several free slots available to you to save your own customized soldiers to inflict maximum pain on you enemies. The other mode of play is the zombie mode. Here, you have to get rid of waves of zombies until you die. This is a very hectic mode with a lot of fun.I really enjoy this game but I must admit that I don’t like being pushed to a dedicate server to play.   I would prefer to have a selection of servers to choose from instead of that. Just a preference on my behalf. Graphically the game is awesome. The soundtrack and sound effects are great and the controls are fantastic.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Great Graphics-	Splendid single player campaign-	Several online modes of play-	Responsive controls-	Achievements and Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	You can’t select a game serverWell, I am back in Duty. . .

												People hate this game due to it being very politcally correct, and I agree it is, but you won't notice it while in gameplay.Overall, it is a great, solid COD game that gave what it promised and nothing less.*SPOILERS AHEAD*Campaign: In the campaign you play as Pvt. Ronald ""Red"" Daniels, a texas farmboy. In his younger years, he was traumatized and filled with guilt when is older brother, Paul, was attacked by a wild wolf. He struggled to get the bullet in the gun to shoot him, but Paul grabbed his knife and stabbed the wolf. As they straggled home, Paul fell, and sadly died. This is a very common theme throughout the campaign, showing flashbacks and visions throughout. During the beginning of the campaign, he is tackled by a Nazi Soldier, which is when Zussman tackles the Nazi. He is stabbed but, Red carries him to a bunker with pistol in hand, saving his life. He is led by Sgt. Pierson and Lieutenant Turner on a battle to take back         France from German control. But sadly Turner is killed, with Pierson taking control and Red as his second in command. Pierson started to become cold, and cruel to his men. Later, during an operation Zussman is captured and is presumed dead. Red becomes tired of Pierson and snaps him out of his trance. They are led on to the Rhine, resulting in an allied victory, and later the retrieving of Zussman. It is said towards the end of the campaign that Reds fiancee, is pregnant, which in the Epilogue is revealed they named the baby after Turner. The campaign is truly gut -wrenching and goes back to its roots. 95/100Multiplayer: The multiplayer is mediocre at best. My favorite thing about it is Headquarters, which is an area were you can socialize, test weapons, and customize everything. Shotguns are a big problem as they are powerful and dont spread as much. I would nerf the Toggle Action and the STG, as they are very OP weapons. Not much to say here. 65/100Zombies: Tight spaces for guts and glory! No but seriously, there are a lot of points to get stuck and die at, so that could be worked on. Also can we get some better wall weapons, after round 7 it takes 10-15 rounds to take them out. Also server connections are terrible. I'm getting kicked out at very random points, and at high levels too. Again not much to say. 85/100Overall, its pretty solid, but there are some tweaks that can be worked on. Overall score 81/100"

The Year of CODSo despite the hate that seems to come with the Call of Duty name these past few years WWII is actually a pretty fun game. It looks nice but it’s no BF1 quality graphics. It has the look but clearly has lower resolution textures in most areas. Having said that the game is a lot more cluttered so it makes sense that the textures would be a little lower to compensate for the extra assets.CampaignThe campaign brought back a lot of memories from the original Call of Duty games, specifically Call of Duty 2 and World at War. The story wasn’t overly cinematic in terms of the character progression as it just seems to follows the major battles of World War II and pushing back the Germans to the point where the war is won. Obviously this is the most realistic way to layout the story because well... that’s what happened, my issue is the trailers were setup in a way that made the campaign look like it was a story with a major antagonist, perhaps a high up German Officer that you perhaps have to track down and eliminate because he has a lot of influence and to help change the course of the war or something but it’s really just....not. 7.8/10- Solid throwback it the series roots"

												Listen to me now, Ignore the bad reviews about this game and either A Play it for yourself B Watch some gameplay.This game is honestly the best call of duty after 4+ years of crap this series has finally redeemed itself with this game.The main story line is perfect the whole ""No nazi flags and black female nazis"" is false in campaign. It is perfectly dark and gritty and really makes you think of what the people must have felt like and if you really get into the game it gives you slight ptsd no crap you really connect with the characters and the twists are perfect. If you decide to pick up this game do not shy away from taking in small details a few i have noticed, The multiplayer ties into campaign, there are many film references and secret guns! Now multiplayer is pretty great but needs improvement for example the servers have been up and down for a long time (Edit: The servers are up, great and still full of people!) There are many classic game modes and a new ""Classic"" War mode this ties into the main story line and its great for new and old players (The xp is also very VERY Rewarding) Zombies mode is.. And i say this with 100% honesty better than treyarchs they have added many new things and a great story line with even better voice acting. Zombies is however its own thing, I can't wait for the DLC for zombies and where they go next!TLDR: Campaign is dark and gritty.. Perfect, Multiplayer is great but needs a little work. Zombies is the best it has ever been!                                 Score: 9/10"

												NOT historically accurate but solid enough. Everything is wrong. Uniforms, ranks, weapons, vehicles, everything. They didnt even care to give the right rate of fire to the guns. So MG42 for example is shooting 800rpm tops, of course everyone with even a tiny bit of knowledge about WW2-era guns knows MG42 has a rate of fire of 1200-1500rpm. Thats a huge differnce and it does take a lot of the authentic feeling away. Its pretty clear that they didnt care one bit to make this game historically accurate. I think its a balancing issue for the mp mode. If they had, for example, given MG42 the correct rate of fire, it would have been a lot better then all the other MG`s in the game, historically it was better then all the others. But the 12 year old kids that make up 85% of the mp-players wouldnt like it because they want all the guns perfectly balanced. I understand this, but they could have had easily given the guns different stats for mp and sp mode. So you could get the authentic WW2 feeling in the sp mode and the preschool kids playing mp would have had their guns balanced. They didnt do that however, and im pretty sure the reason was that its extra work. I do recommend this game anyway, its classic COD gameplay, you get what you expect from COD. The SP mode is a little over the top sometimes but i guess thats ok. Zombie mode is quite nice too. And if youre a 12 year old french kid with absolutely no knowledge about guns, your gonna love the mp mode...."

												I played the campaign. It was great. Im gonna talk mainly about the multiplayer. I had mixed feelings about the multiplayer at the beginning. Tbh, I didn't like this game when i first played. I played for 40 minutes then refunded. Then some of my friends bought it, so i bought it again. But now i like the game. All u have to do is to spend enough time in this game. It's not bad, the maps are not that small, if u play for sometimes and know the maps actually. I haven't seen so many ""HACKERS"" that other reviews were saying, and those reviews were one of the reasons I bought this game this lately. Otherwise, I would've bought it earlier. The servers aren't too bad either. They will work on it I hope. Haven't faced any minor performance issues. Overall, I love this game now."

												This is honestly an amazing game. Yes, I get mad at it most of the time.

You can't change teams, but this is probably good             The Spawns are really rediculous. Summary: You should definately get this game if you are into shooters. It's fun and helps you with your skill. If you love challenges, get it."

												Before giving it a thumbs down just because I rate it as positive read the review...First of all its not the best CoD, but its not worst, and to be honest its actually good.The singleplayer was actually given some attention this time, not like the last 4/5 CoDs (this is my opinion, don't hate on it).I really enjoyed having to use medkits to get my health back, it took me back to the time when I used to play the good old Medal of Honor games. And the other ''helps'' you get from your teammates were a good idea. Besides that, gameplay wise, the game runs great my PC is not the best and it runs without any stutter or lag (Low settings 1600x900 though).Now on to what actually made me ''mad'', the Nazi's had PPsH and type 100 has guns while I rushed the Omaha beach bunkers, it doesn't ruin the experience but it just gets on my nerves. But overall the singleplayer is a great experience and im pretty sure you will enjoy it.The Multiplayer: the launch was not the best and it had a big amount of errors that ruined the experience for everyone, im not gonna stay here and defend SHgames or Activision because I feel like the game should have not had this many errors. But  when games have big launchs some errors are expected (but not like how we saw in CoD), when GTA V opened the multiplayer it was literally unplayable and it still was a great game.CoD had a great port being able to run it on my PC is amazing. Scorestreaks are not overpowered, gun mechanics are good (considering its a game...) the arsenal we have at our hands is good, smg's do not run the game and shotguns are not broken. And now we even have dedicated servers so the P2P connection is gone making the multiplayer even a better experience. Camos are not stupid and some actually look good, variants are not p2w which Im really happy with and the new addition HeadQuarters is a fun experience, letting you run free while interacting with everything that CoD gives you, and the new gamemode ''War'' is good, it forces players to work together which makes this gamemode an awesome experience.Zombies this year was a bit disappointing, as a CoD fan that played the World at War zombies and the BO1 zombies I have to say this zombies are not as good. I love BO1 zombies and the maps ''Ascencion'' and ''Kino der Toten'' were my favourite maps of all time. With weapons like the ''Thundergun'' and the ''Ray gun'' they made me smile when I got them in the mystery box, so  it makes me sad that this new zombies do not have those guns even though I understand why they don't have it, just like the perks Juggernog, etc... Its still a good zombies game, but its just not the way I like it.Overall Call of Duty: WWII is a good game, even though some people say its♥♥♥♥♥♥and runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ its not true, it has its flaws, yes every game does, but give it a try you won't regret it."

												Disclaimer: This entire review is solely MY opinion! I’ve finished the single player, and I am currently Prestige 2 level 42 in Multiplayer, also have finished the Zombies easter egg.This is one of my favorite COD games in 5 years, being a big fan of especially COD 2 and COD 4, I was glad to see world war 2 back in COD’s style.This game definitely is not historically accurate, there’s some accuracies and some inaccuracies, but regardless of them saying it was going to be accurate, we should understand its a video game. Let’s not hate a game for a main reason being “German Soldiers having a PPSH on D-Day?!”.Another thing I’d like to address is the graphics, the graphics of this game are very pleasing in my opinion, while the cinematic cutscenes are fantastic. People often hate on this game for the graphics being “Sub-Par” but let’s face it, if call of duty had pure REALISTIC graphics, people would complain of it copying battlefield. It would also take the COD feel away from the game.The campaign is very short (5-6 hours), but is also entertaining and can be gruesome at some parts (I.E Belltower scene in Operation Cobra), the ending is a little underwhelming and some of characters don’t get enough screen time for me to get attached to them fully. The only character I really enjoyed was Zussman, even though he had very little character development. The multiplayer is incredibly fun in my opinion, I enjoy playing every division and every gun feels incredibly satisfying to use. There are definitely some balance issues, (STG is a little OP, BAR, Snipers are too easy to use, etc) However, the developers seem to be making some effort in fixing these issues. A major issue however, is the hackers, there’s a lot of hackers with what seems to be no punishment from reports. This can ruin the game for a lot of people and it often makes me a little irritated. The Zombies mode is definitely my least favorite mostly because of how linear it feels, you finish the easter egg and then well, you get bored soon after, it’s the same round feeling over and over again, the map isn’t unique enough where I want to actually explore it, etc. However I already have a biased view due to my lack of experience in the COD zombies mode as a whole. I won’t give a definitive opinion as the DLC zombie maps are not out, I will assume it will get better though.Overall, I’d rate this game a 7/10, the campaign is short but rather fun and interesting, the multiplayer has some issues but is great if you’d like to relax and play a game without having to do much thinking, the zombies is only fun with a group of friends and gets boring very quickly."

												I truly do love this game. I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign, although it was too short, which is expectected in all Call of Dutys. Multiplayer is a ""meh"" due to the overload of hackers prevalent within the community. The true standout though is zombies. Coming from someone who hasn't played zombies since BO2, due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t exo suits and crappy maps, I am truly overjoyed to get back to some basic zombies. I can play non stop for HOURS due to the casual ""easter egg"" which is more like a campaign. If I want a challenge, I play the hardcore easter egg, which is most definitely an easter egg. Gun mechanics are wonderful, zombie prestige encourages me to play more, unlocks and attachments lead me to each level, etc. Can't stop playing."

												This game is not worth the trouble in buying. Many, many buyers are complaining about the game when it comes down to the updates. Many are experiencing an error called code 5. Steam, Activision isnt providing any useful help or support. Plus, to add a more dissatifaction. Steam will not refund the game if you have over 2 hours of game play. Its not like they gave us a CD. Is was a download. The game isnt working. Just like a new car. If you purchase one and the engine blows. You will want it fixed or return it if its only been used a few miles. The game is only working 50%. That means it is only working for single play. Multiplayer is useless. Therefore making the game worthless. As a long time Steam buyer and Steam can look it up. I have spent hundreds of dollars in Steam for me and my son. This will no longer happen. Buyers beware."

The hacking problem is pretty bad but it doesn't happen too often to the point of not wanting to play. If you find a hacker in a lobby then just leave. Also, I kind of like them listening to the ""no micro transactions"" and ""boots on ground"" thing the CoD community has been telling them for a while and I'm happy that they listen to us. In conclusion, for 60$ don't buy it but if theres a sale then buy it, the multiplayer is pretty bad but if you're good at FPS then do it."

												An amazing game and already in my list of best games of the year!maybe the game is not as accurate as real history but all I care is just the gameplay and if the game is funLet's start with this, the game is fun as hell which is why I love it so much.I don't give a crap about no black Nazis or PPSH in freaking Normandy. Did I have fun in the game? Hell yea I did!Am I gonna continue playing? ♥♥♥♥ yea I will!Now let's start with the campaign, the campaign follows Red Daniels as the protagonist of COD WW2 Campaignand with his buds Zussman, Stiles, Aielo, etcnow I am not going to spoil anything all I have to say is that I love the story of the campaign, the campaign showed personality and made the characters feel alive...The graphics are nothing but amazing, I felt like I was watching a movie on Blu Ray.The Battle of the Bulge was amazing and a badass mission like good gosh I think I need a nap after playing this mission!Now the real deal here is the multiplayer...The multiplayer is fun, you actually feel like there's progression.There's a new mode that is based on objectives called War which is my favorite mode already!Now the connection is probably not the best thing ever but at least some of it is playable...but there are just lags and glitches that make this game really not enjoyableI don't feel like there's a weapon balance or at least some variety in weaponsinstead of these ♥♥♥♥faces using Sturmgewehr44! that weapon! Jesus!it is so overpowered it makes this game so hard when the whole opponent team is using this against you!The worst thing I personally despise in this game is that it's the opposite of being ''responsive gameplay''believe me or not, sometimes I pull the trigger before the enemy does and the enemy still gets the kill, it doesn't always happen but it needs to be adressed.there is no way you haven't had in your entire life a COD match without you saying ''BUT I SHOT FIRST IT MAKES NO SENSE''. I had to mention the ''Responsive gameplay'' of the game...to sum up the multiplayer is not perfect, it's somewhat enjoyable for me personally because I am bad at this game so... there are really some times I get no kills because of lags or just myself being really bad.Anyway I will probably be satisfied with the game when I get to prestige 1, I know it's just prestige 1 but for me it's kinda beating the game in some ways, I will take a little break from the game and sometimes come back for 2 matches or something...Because I am not the COD player who grinds the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game (which is completely fine if you are one of those, your game, your choice)In my language prestige 1 means ''you just beat this game bro''Now I will come back in big events or new maps and weapons to get to experience the game even further!What makes the game extremely unplayable is the inactive PC communityit's extremely rare to get in a Hardcore match, Kill confirmed, Free for all, Gridion, etcI found myself annoyed on the limit of modes I can actually play3 modes I can actually play no problem, TDM, War, Domination. that's it!other modes are just stupidly rare to play in PC...The zombies is really cool and creepy now and I enjoy playing it and get some jumpscares on the way.Overall I recommend this masterpiecesay whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want about this game, I personally love itGood job Sledgehammer...... You absolutely nailed it!*Update*In January 20th 2018:I tried so hard to get into a War match which is my favorite mode everand literally 0 games foundIt's incredibly frustrating, I tried too many times weeks agoI couldnt get the new weapons because lack of gameplayI couldnt get Salvage points and even the Sten which is only 33 matches completeand I activated it on December 13th!And literally it describes the activity I have been only in 33 matches since December 13th to this date I am typing the review...the inactivity for the game makes me give up on trying because I can't get in any matchthe last match I've been in was incredibly laggy, and it sucks my motivation to get back to the game, hopefully the event on January 23rd will make activity like months agoit's really sad that this is how I ended up stopping playing the game, not because it ''Got old'' or ''Repetitive'' it's when I still got the motivation to play it again except I can't play it anymore because no one is playing it...I am hoping for a change..."

												This game is not worth the trouble in buying. Many, many buyers are complaining about the game when it comes down to the updates. Many are experiencing an error called code 5. Steam, Activision isnt providing any useful help or support. Plus, to add a more dissatifaction. Steam will not refund the game if you have over 2 hours of game play. Its not like they gave us a CD. Is was a download. The game isnt working. Just like a new car. If you purchase one and the engine blows. You will want it fixed or return it if its only been used a few miles. The game is only working 50%. That means it is only working for single play. Multiplayer is useless. Therefore making the game worthless. As a long time Steam buyer and Steam can look it up. I have spent hundreds of dollars in Steam for me and my son. This will no longer happen. Buyers beware."

												TLDR: S**t singleplayer, toxic community, bad balancing, partly bad map design, cheaters and lots and lots of bugs. Don't buy.

												Very enjoyable gameplay, probably the best CoD in years gameplay-wise. Unfortunately it's also the buggiest CoD ever. The game is literally broken. Netcode is completely busted. Some servers you hit every shot, other Servers your shots won't register at all and you get killed before you even see the enemy killing you. Orders (your daily/weekly challenges) are resetting left and right, Leaderboards are broken since day 1. I'd love to play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game but its just frustrating at this point. No communication from the developer so far. I'm hoping they are quietly fixing the issues, altough unsure if the Netcode is even fixable. It's a real shame."

Overall, the zombies is refreshing, the multiplayer is rather enjoyable and the campaign is quite fun and has amazing character development. This isn't the best cod ever of course, however ; when I say it's the best in 6 years, I truly mean it, as it has a special and unique charm to it.... yes, even the supply drops are pretty good, it's probably the best drop system ever. I'd have to give the game around a 7.5/10 at the moment. I'm excited for both the Zombies and Multiplayer Dlc, which is a first, here's hoping it'll be as good, if not better than the main game."

												Don't let the reviews from ""expert CoDifiers"" fool you. This is a good game (especially compared to some of the more recent Call of Duties), even with the campaign character rendering bugs (which is normal for day one releases. If you complain about this bug, you should have played Mass Effect Andromeda when it first came out).Now, as far as all of the people claiming that the German's never used PPSH-41's, I refer you to this article of several I've looked at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPSh-41""After the German Army captured large numbers of the PPSh-41 during World War II, a program was instituted to convert the weapon to the standard German submachine gun cartridge – 9×19mm Parabellum. The Wehrmacht officially adopted the converted PPSh-41 as the ""MP41(r)""; unconverted PPSh-41s were designated ""MP717(r)"" and supplied with 7.63×25mm Mauser ammunition (which is dimensionally identical to 7.62×25mm, but slightly less powerful). German-language manuals for the use of captured PPShs were printed and distributed in the Wehrmacht.""And from another article:""The captured PPSh was, in particular, a favorite weapon among the Germans. Because of the similarities between the 7.62x25mm Tokarev and the 7.63x25mm Mauser cartridge used in the Mauser C96 pistol, the PPsh was easily supplied with ammunition. In fact so many were captured that it became the second-most-common submachinegun used by German forces - even on the Western Front where Eastern Front veterans were sent for ""R&R"" assignemnts. Also, attempts were made to convert the weapon to 9mm Parabellum to conform to German logistics. The Wehrmacht officially adopted the converted PPSh-41 as the MP41(r); unconverted PPSh-41s were designated MP717(r). German-language manuals for the use of captured PPShs were printed and distributed in the Wehrmacht.""The standard $59.99 game is definitely worth it, though I never recommend paying more for a season pass before you know what the DLCs will be.If you are worried about getting it, wait a few more weeks for more reviews to come out."

												Let me make this quick and clear. If you're getting this game for the multiplayer then don't. The maps are mediocre at best and the weapon balance is laughable. On top of that there aren't even dedicated servers. So if the host has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ connection, then prepare to have a very laggy game. If you're getting this game for zombies then you won't be disappointed. This is the first zombies experience I've enjoyed in quite awhile. I'm overall rating this negatively because I know that most people that are going to buy this game are going to play Multiplayer and not zombies.Oh and if you're wondering why it shows that I only have 1/2 an hour played is because the Multiplayer and Zombies is a separate executable from Steam."

												Don't let the reviews from ""expert CoDifiers"" fool you. This is a good game (especially compared to some of the more recent Call of Duties), even with the campaign character rendering bugs (which is normal for day one releases. If you complain about this bug, you should have played Mass Effect Andromeda when it first came out).Now, as far as all of the people claiming that the German's never used PPSH-41's, I refer you to this article of several I've looked at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPSh-41""After the German Army captured large numbers of the PPSh-41 during World War II, a program was instituted to convert the weapon to the standard German submachine gun cartridge – 9×19mm Parabellum. The Wehrmacht officially adopted the converted PPSh-41 as the ""MP41(r)""; unconverted PPSh-41s were designated ""MP717(r)"" and supplied with 7.63×25mm Mauser ammunition (which is dimensionally identical to 7.62×25mm, but slightly less powerful). German-language manuals for the use of captured PPShs were printed and distributed in the Wehrmacht.""And from another article:""The captured PPSh was, in particular, a favorite weapon among the Germans. Because of the similarities between the 7.62x25mm Tokarev and the 7.63x25mm Mauser cartridge used in the Mauser C96 pistol, the PPsh was easily supplied with ammunition. In fact so many were captured that it became the second-most-common submachinegun used by German forces - even on the Western Front where Eastern Front veterans were sent for ""R&R"" assignemnts. Also, attempts were made to convert the weapon to 9mm Parabellum to conform to German logistics. The Wehrmacht officially adopted the converted PPSh-41 as the MP41(r); unconverted PPSh-41s were designated MP717(r). German-language manuals for the use of captured PPShs were printed and distributed in the Wehrmacht.""The standard $59.99 game is definitely worth it, though I never recommend paying more for a season pass before you know what the DLCs will be.If you are worried about getting it, wait a few more weeks for more reviews to come out."

												Just finished the campaign. Despite the arguement over historical accuracy, I want to summarize my first impression.In short, if you like Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan and other classic WWII media productions, I promise you that you will not be disappointed by the campaign.It has been a while since I played a COD game and felt such a strong connection that even made me cry at the end (call me a pu$$y all you want, but the ending reminded me of the ending of Band of Brothers which also made me cry. Actually, half of the campaign reminded me of Band of Brothers and the other half Saving Private Ryan).Yes, indeed. Sledgehammer promised they want to make the most historical accurate COD ever and sure as hell this game didn't achieve even half of it. However, thinking back to those old WWII movies and games that we all loved so much, did they achieve 100% accuracy? Not really. But people still loved them. Pros and Cons? Simple, horrible optimization and not giving us the historical accuracy that was once promised are two fatal cons that resulted in at least 70% of the negative comments. Pros? Literally everything else in campaign.I can't figure out a brief way to praise the game, but I can assure you if you play through the campaign as if you're part of one of those good old WWII movie, you'll love it.At last, I still want to point out. Sledgehammer, if you don't intend to keep the accuracy in COD you don't have to make those statements in your annoucement streaming, for you have proven you are totally capable of ignoring it and still make a good game. Making these promises yet not realizing them will back fire at you really bad."

												This game has gotten a lot of hate for its historical inaccuracy, and I definetely agree. What really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off about it was the claim that WW2 was the most deadly conflict in human history, which is an utter lie. Pick any one of China's civil wars and it would viciously outshadow WW2 by over 5 times. But anyway, the historical accuracy isn't what I should talk about, since it's mainly been addressed by others. I'll start off by saying that there was obviously a push to make Hitler and the Nazis seem like the worst people to ever walk the planet. I like the touch in the second chapter of the main character defending the dead Nazi soldiers, telling his friends to not insult the dead.  It may be ""politically incorrect"", but Id be interested in following a German soldier during WW2 (obviously not one who wanted to ""purify the German race"",) but one who was pressured by his family to enlist or just felt patriotic. I must compliment Sledgehammer Games with their beginning cinematic. I could feel the guts and sacrifice of young American (and British) men to go and enlist. I wish we still had that fire in us today. I've rambled enough, so I'll sum up my statement. Historical Accuracy: 2/10Video Quality: 10/10Storyline: 7/10Cant say anything about Multiplayer, havent tried it (besides the beta which i didnt care for.)Worth it? If you're interested in a good storyline, eh I'd recommend it sure, if you really care for historical accuracy, then meh. I personally like it, but I feel it was a bit rushed, (I know there is some media intervention, kind of pisses me off, though I do understand some of their concerns)"

The hacking problem is pretty bad but it doesn't happen too often to the point of not wanting to play. If you find a hacker in a lobby then just leave. Also, I kind of like them listening to the ""no micro transactions"" and ""boots on ground"" thing the CoD community has been telling them for a while and I'm happy that they listen to us. In conclusion, for 60$ don't buy it but if theres a sale then buy it, the multiplayer is pretty bad but if you're good at FPS then do it."

												Well its ok. Not a disaster like Ghosts and way betetr than most MW series, but not close to Black ops. To put that comment in context I have 1,000 to 2,000 hours on the betetr CODs (Black ops, MW3, etc) . It plays ok as a run and gun game kinda like black ops 2 or 3 but only 5 maps means snooze came really quick.  Only one has real sniper potential and its the worst map. No nuketown type small but fun to play map either. Its just becoming dull.The ""care packages"" are also dull compred to black ops, hardly worth my effort opeing them as no new guns and poor camos. Ive prestieged a couple of times (about 200 hours) but honestly not sure if ill ivest the time to go master prestige like I have for most of the others.Sumnmary: it needs a lot more maps and some new guns real fast. The excessive number of hackers also need to be curtailed-- does the report actually do anything?"

												People who are giving this game negative reviews are VERY picky and pick out every little detail that is wrong with the game. The multiplayer doesn't have to been historically accurate because last time i checked no soldiers were doing 360 no scopes and firing bazookas to kill one enemy and there grown men shouting not five year olds. I will agree that the female soldiers are dumb though and so are the nazi flags not being present and some of the guns, like the PPSH, don't beling on Normandy or on any fight with the Americans. But loook at what the game has to offer, it plays really well, the graphics are really nice and the cutscene ones are SO GOOD, the story is really well written, the sounds are really good, the zombies mode can be a little scary in my opinion and it's really fun to play at night with the lights off. The multiplayer I haven't touched too miuch on since i haven't played it that much but from what i've played it's pretty nice and runs smoothly. There are sime issues like some crashing which has happened twice to me but hasn't ever since a while ago. All in all I give this game 7.5/10"

The multiplayer also seems to have regressed since past CODs with clunky UIs,♥♥♥♥♥♥poor weapon balancing, forgettable maps, and severe lack of customization loadout-wise. It's interesting to see CoD go back to WW2 but it makes the game feel bland and drab. (which is up to preference, but if you enjoy it consider  World at War instead) Also worth noting that many cosmetics are only obtainable through lootboxes like the past few CoDs."

												First of all, the game runs pretty damn well on PC compared to previous COD titles. However, there are systemic problems with the netcode that make this game unplayable for any serious FPS player.First, it feels as if there is some form of reverse peeker's advantage. Coming around corners or jiggle peeking only to insta die before you can even react against people holding angles. You can even see it in the kill cam that they don't have super human reactions, just that you were further out from the corner on their screen before you got shot. This is the opposite of what usually happens in a FPS where the person holding the angle is at a severe disadvantage.Second, due to hitmarkers being displayed yet the enemy not taking any damage, and the peeker disadvantage, run and gun playstyle is dead. Skilled players now have a higher chance of losing those 1v1 aim battles and therefore should now hold angles. This runs contrary to ever other COD since the original. Once the majority of the player base discovers this, the game will grind to a stand still of campers.If you are looking for more than a casual FPS, avoid this like the plague until these issues are fixed."

												Game is difficult to setup.  Downloaded both versions and multiplayer runs slow and controls and game play is so difficult.  The single player version has never worked.  Downloaded and run and it begins to boot but freezes.  Have to go to the activision web site and they aren't helpful at all.  Rating of 1-10 I'd rate this a ""2""."

												So I finished my first call of duty game ever... my opinion... I liked it a lot ... but for that price 7 hours of gameplay is not worth so much money at all ... I would love to see option to choose from buying single player, multiplayer or both ... I am not going to recommend it as long as you dont have lots of money to spend on games ... nowdays there is too many cheaper games offering so much more gameplay... This game is offering amazing graphics and visuals, but I still feel like I need more gameplay instead of ultra graphics..."

												Guys this call of duty game is awesome since black ops 3.I know that there are a lot of negative reviews but for me this game is amazing mostly with nazi zombies, in this ww2 game the zombies experiance is scary and fun to play with friends rather than playing just for ranking.The multiplayer is beyond epic since it returned to the old days and neutral call of duty, moreover u have divisions that u can choose from and much more game modes like war mode.The campaign as always the best story u will ever experiance that fills u with excitement and makes u want to know more.I really do recommand people to buy this game and ignore what people feel about this game, if u watched the trailers and gameplays on youtube and u liked it, then go for it and buy it."

												Well its ok. Not a disaster like Ghosts and way betetr than most MW series, but not close to Black ops. To put that comment in context I have 1,000 to 2,000 hours on the betetr CODs (Black ops, MW3, etc) . It plays ok as a run and gun game kinda like black ops 2 or 3 but only 5 maps means snooze came really quick.  Only one has real sniper potential and its the worst map. No nuketown type small but fun to play map either. Its just becoming dull.The ""care packages"" are also dull compred to black ops, hardly worth my effort opeing them as no new guns and poor camos. Ive prestieged a couple of times (about 200 hours) but honestly not sure if ill ivest the time to go master prestige like I have for most of the others.Sumnmary: it needs a lot more maps and some new guns real fast. The excessive number of hackers also need to be curtailed-- does the report actually do anything?"

												People who are giving this game negative reviews are VERY picky and pick out every little detail that is wrong with the game. The multiplayer doesn't have to been historically accurate because last time i checked no soldiers were doing 360 no scopes and firing bazookas to kill one enemy and there grown men shouting not five year olds. I will agree that the female soldiers are dumb though and so are the nazi flags not being present and some of the guns, like the PPSH, don't beling on Normandy or on any fight with the Americans. But loook at what the game has to offer, it plays really well, the graphics are really nice and the cutscene ones are SO GOOD, the story is really well written, the sounds are really good, the zombies mode can be a little scary in my opinion and it's really fun to play at night with the lights off. The multiplayer I haven't touched too miuch on since i haven't played it that much but from what i've played it's pretty nice and runs smoothly. There are sime issues like some crashing which has happened twice to me but hasn't ever since a while ago. All in all I give this game 7.5/10"

												THE ONLY REASON I RECOMMEND THIS GAME IS FOR PS4/XBOX1 NOT FOR PC IF YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO GET IT FOR CONSOLE DONT BUY IT ON PC ITS NOT WORTH IT. The multiplayer is okay its nothing like old old cod but its not terrible. Most of the story missions are boring until you get to one called ""liberation"" which is FANTASTIC so ♥♥♥♥ing good it shows what they could do with story missions but choose not to and I am so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off right now because the mission after the best mission in CoD history is a tank mission which is impossible to control the ♥♥♥♥ing tank. My mouse doesnt move the ♥♥♥♥ing barrel at all the asdw keys constantly change what they do. Its so frustrating If i could id ♥♥♥♥ing refund based on this alone.

												Ever since they made the EXP ""normal"" the game feels like a grind, and is not very fun anymore. Cheaters run rampant like there isn't a anticheat in the game. Tbh the only good thing about this game is the boots on the ground part, other than that the maps, guns, and gameplay and ""dedicated servers"" suck. I only bought this game because the beta wasn't bad and they listed to the community and made adjustments. But when the full game came out they reverted all of the adjustments they made in the beta and left it the way it is now, garbage. The game is already dying, save your money for something better."

I can run the game pretty well on a GTX 950, definetly not the best graphics card out there.For me its a bit like te first COD's, if you liked them you will probably like this one too."

												Coming from someone that hasn't played a Call of Duty game since Ghosts (and what a disaster that was) this game honestly isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It runs perfectly well on my rig (980ti, i7 4790), 0 stutters or frame issues. Multiplayer feels FAR superior to the past few games. A ton of different options as far as weapons/divisions/basic trainings go.The crate system honestly isn't all that bad - nothing but cosmetic items from what i can tell, and you can get earn the crates VERY easily in game. 3 hours in and I probably had 15 or more? Compared to Rocket League (A game I LOVE) where you have a rare chance at earning crates then have to buy a key for it, this is a nice refresher in being able to obtain every item in the game without dropping a cent more than the retail price. And if you want to pay money on the crates then who cares; it's literally nothing but cosmetic items and it's the person's choice on whether or not they want to spend their money.I 100% understand the grievances pertaining to realism, especially because they championed this game as a realistic one. Nothing really all that realistic in the single player campaign and frankly I was bored with it after the first 3 missions. A far cry from Call of Duty 4 where the campaign was fantastic and the multiplayer literally redefined a generation of shooters. Zombies is honestly incredibly fun. It looks great, feels great and scary, and honestly has me remembering the joy of the original Nazi Zombies back in WaW. All in all, while this isn't the NEXT COD4 in terms of groundbreaking or pure enjoyment, it's an incredibly fun shooter with a wide range of options that everyone is hating because it's called ""Call of Duty"" or because they cannot run it well. Again, I can't speak to that as I have run the game just fine on my computer. I'd buy it at $60 if you don't think money is an issue to you and I'd probably go as far as spending $40-$45 otherwise."

												Read some of the negative reviews and I'm like OMG - people, it suppsed to be a game ! Not real life ! At some point the realism of it reaches to a level and stops !...Who cares what insignia the Germans had on their uniforms in the game !? If you want reality, join the army ! And for Christ's sake -  atleast wait a day or two to allow patches to come on board. It may fix minor issues before you throw in the towel and give it a 0 - 10 review ! Theres like a million different PC builds using a million different hardware - There gonna be glitches for some folk ! I first got crackling sound the first time I ran it on launch day - today that seems to be fixed perfectly. Anyway, the game is a fun and an exciting as far as I'm concerned. With the right display, power and sound - the experience is awesome ! Feels like Call of Duty to me - Like World at War updated with nice missions, smoother gameplay graphics and sound - just what I was hoping for."

												Just finished the campaign. Despite the arguement over historical accuracy, I want to summarize my first impression.In short, if you like Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan and other classic WWII media productions, I promise you that you will not be disappointed by the campaign.It has been a while since I played a COD game and felt such a strong connection that even made me cry at the end (call me a pu$$y all you want, but the ending reminded me of the ending of Band of Brothers which also made me cry. Actually, half of the campaign reminded me of Band of Brothers and the other half Saving Private Ryan).Yes, indeed. Sledgehammer promised they want to make the most historical accurate COD ever and sure as hell this game didn't achieve even half of it. However, thinking back to those old WWII movies and games that we all loved so much, did they achieve 100% accuracy? Not really. But people still loved them. Pros and Cons? Simple, horrible optimization and not giving us the historical accuracy that was once promised are two fatal cons that resulted in at least 70% of the negative comments. Pros? Literally everything else in campaign.I can't figure out a brief way to praise the game, but I can assure you if you play through the campaign as if you're part of one of those good old WWII movie, you'll love it.At last, I still want to point out. Sledgehammer, if you don't intend to keep the accuracy in COD you don't have to make those statements in your annoucement streaming, for you have proven you are totally capable of ignoring it and still make a good game. Making these promises yet not realizing them will back fire at you really bad."

If you're getting this game for zombies then you won't be disappointed. This is the first zombies experience I've enjoyed in quite awhile.

If i wanted to die in 2 hits i would play hardcore modes ... even IW and BO3 are better. I die behind corners too often cuz the netcode can't handle the 2 shot kill damage modifier..."

												So codww2 what is there to say about it, well first of all sledgehammer really got it this time.This game just have it all, the grapic is good, the sound is crazy, and the cinematic is just sooo awsome that you actuelly think it is a real movie you are playing. The story in the game is so awasome, not to mention that you get a hole new perspsektive on ww2 then you ever had before.I dont want to spoil anything so im trying no too but i can asure you that this game has gone to a hole new level since, they made codmw2. We thugt we have seen it all from them but in the past 4 years they havent really made new cod games were the campaign is just awsome. Now they upped it and made so many new feauturs you havent seen in any other game before.There is one sligth thing i was really annoyed by and that is that the game only took me 6 hours to complete on hard, Not a long game but really really fun and a game i will play agin and agin.So here is my point to the game.Sounds. 10. You feal like you are in ww2 when the bombs comming down on you, and the rifle sound are so realistic.Grapfic. 9.5Gameplay. 9 couse it can be hard to play the game some times in the controles.Cinematic. Definetly a 10+++All in all i give this a 9.5 out of 10. And this game could really be a future game they should develop."

												Call of Duty: WWIIPro's+ Is a very darn pretty game. + Runs perfectly fine on my system (don't see why people are complaining about it being a bad port)+ Gives you the option to use a controller (If you're playing online don't, you'll get destroyed)+ The face capture is impressive as the game isn't locked to 30FPS like other face capture heavy games (looking at you LA Noire)+ The campaign is actually enjoyable and the chharacters are believable+The progression system is fair.+You can earn supply drops completely free+AI online callouts are actually very good (your teammates will have AI voices actively calling out that enemies are at strategic areas of the map)+ Despite people moaning I haven't seen any hackers since the beta+ The hitboxes are very good in multiplayer.Con's- It still isn't perfect and some bugs need ironing out- Sometimes weapon loadouts bug out (I set an LMG on a class and went into a game, it wasn't there)- Why call the points in zombies jolts? (not an issue just seems wierd)- There are limited edition helmets in the game but they are like Paratrooper style. (US) but you can still equip them on the Axis side so it looks really wierd. I have died because I mistook an enemy soldier for a friendly.- Why are there female faces? (Not from a sexist point of view but from a historic one) BF1 didn't give in to social pressure. Women still weren't that common a sight on the European Theatre of war in WWII.SummaryWell it is a Call of Duty game and it isn't for everyone.

												I honestly dont know why ppl are hatin on this game its fun, great campaign, zombies is great, AND the MP is great. They delivered exactly what was promised to the tee. People complain about the optimization but dont read the system requirements before buying thats their fault not Activisions. People complain about the historical accuracy, yes we all know colored women didnt even come close to combat in most situations but do u rly think Activision wanted the mainstream media breathing down their neck and possibly have the game removed from stores? I think not. Same goes for the lack of swastickas in the game mainstream media would have had a fit. And yes the Nazis use of the PPSH-41 in the western front is not accurate whatsoever but if the game only included weapons from the western front there would only be a small handful of weapons in the game, which people would complain about. so quit ♥♥♥♥♥ing and look at the core of the game, people are way too picky about heir games these days especially AAA titles. Overall its a great game with an in depth and lengthy campaign, challenging and fun zombies, and EXTREMELY fun Mulitplayer with many gamemodes and weapons to choose from. I RATE 10/10 FINALLY A GOOD COD THAT I WILL PLAY FOR A LONG, LONG TIME"

												I'm going to be that one guy people will call a ""Call of Duty Fanboy"" but here goes..Call of Duty: World War 2 (World at War 2 is what I like to call it) is actually a really good Call of Duty game for once, and the gameplay has improved along with the graphics and story. But they're are Pros and Cons so I'll just list them off: Pros ++ Graphics looking stunning for a COD game such as this, it really does look like the better looking game for the series.+ Animations look great and sometimes it fools me into believing they're actual people instead of CG Rendered models, but in game cutscenes (Though not as nice) still look really good. + Voice acting is a thumbs up from me as I felt the previous series of COD games felt to much like they were forcing their lines, but this game has some of the best voice acting. (Also, Spoiler, David Tennant plays a character in Nazi Zombies)+ Gameplay has changed a bit since the last entry, with no regenerating health anymore (Single Player Only) and a new buddy system makes the game feel more like an old Battlefield game than a COD game. But I have to mention that the Stealth elements, though not perfect, are really fun. + Nazi Zombies this time around feels a lot quicker from the original NZ games as you now get more money from shooting up the Z'ds than boarding up the windows (Which is no longer an option now) and again, the voice acting is great but obviously a lot more cheesy. Cons -- Multiplayer is fun, but the maps aren't great and there are lots of camping spots I feel that they could easily iron out later on. - If the Loot Crates aren't the Loot Crates you can get physical Gaming Merch from, I'm not interested. The whole mechanic feels forced in and it's now literally in your face as you can see people getting loot boxes whilst you're in the Multiplayer hub area. - If I was to dock points from the game, it'd be for the lag and glitches I've seen on the PC version, sometimes I even get slow down or even have my game freeze for like a minute before going back to normal. - Servers aren't great, as a matter of fact I feel like they should have just opted for BattleNET instead of their own servers as it was just a mess at launchOverall: I'd say the game has it's flaws, but considering it's the first time in ages we've seen a COD game with no Jet Packs or Boost Jumping, I'm very happy to see the game is going back to it's old routes, but I really hope they fix the glitches and realize that people don't care about Loot Boxes. So I'll be recommending this game"

												Lets be honest here. If this game didn't have 'Call of Duty' in its title, all the sheeple would be pulling each other off over it. But since they listened to the players and went back to World War 2, the two MAIN THINGS which is being criticised (besides the performance for now) is ""It not being historically correct because I found a russian weapon on the beaches of Normandy, blah blah blah"".My opinion? The game is great fun. Singleplayer is incredible, story is compelling with graphics that are unreal and the new elements implimented into it work well, especially the odd quick time events from Call of Duty 3, however at this stage it's poorly optimised (for most players atleast). But hey, multiplayer is still great!"

												This game is getting a lot of unnecessary bad press... No it's not a realistic shooter, neither a MilSim. It's good ol' Call of Duty at its finest : back to its WW2 roots (that it should never have left imo), guns blazing, explosions all around Hollywood style and so on!Performance-wise, we have seen way worse in recent AAA titles. It runs just fine on Ultra on my GTX 980m (we're talking about a laptop version here...).Definitely recommend it if you enjoy the originals!"

												So codww2 what is there to say about it, well first of all sledgehammer really got it this time.This game just have it all, the grapic is good, the sound is crazy, and the cinematic is just sooo awsome that you actuelly think it is a real movie you are playing. The story in the game is so awasome, not to mention that you get a hole new perspsektive on ww2 then you ever had before.I dont want to spoil anything so im trying no too but i can asure you that this game has gone to a hole new level since, they made codmw2. We thugt we have seen it all from them but in the past 4 years they havent really made new cod games were the campaign is just awsome. Now they upped it and made so many new feauturs you havent seen in any other game before.There is one sligth thing i was really annoyed by and that is that the game only took me 6 hours to complete on hard, Not a long game but really really fun and a game i will play agin and agin.So here is my point to the game.Sounds. 10. You feal like you are in ww2 when the bombs comming down on you, and the rifle sound are so realistic.Grapfic. 9.5Gameplay. 9 couse it can be hard to play the game some times in the controles.Cinematic. Definetly a 10+++All in all i give this a 9.5 out of 10. And this game could really be a future game they should develop."

												Call of Duty: WWIIPro's+ Is a very darn pretty game. + Runs perfectly fine on my system (don't see why people are complaining about it being a bad port)+ Gives you the option to use a controller (If you're playing online don't, you'll get destroyed)+ The face capture is impressive as the game isn't locked to 30FPS like other face capture heavy games (looking at you LA Noire)+ The campaign is actually enjoyable and the chharacters are believable+The progression system is fair.+You can earn supply drops completely free+AI online callouts are actually very good (your teammates will have AI voices actively calling out that enemies are at strategic areas of the map)+ Despite people moaning I haven't seen any hackers since the beta+ The hitboxes are very good in multiplayer.Con's- It still isn't perfect and some bugs need ironing out- Sometimes weapon loadouts bug out (I set an LMG on a class and went into a game, it wasn't there)- Why call the points in zombies jolts? (not an issue just seems wierd)- There are limited edition helmets in the game but they are like Paratrooper style. (US) but you can still equip them on the Axis side so it looks really wierd. I have died because I mistook an enemy soldier for a friendly.- Why are there female faces? (Not from a sexist point of view but from a historic one) BF1 didn't give in to social pressure. Women still weren't that common a sight on the European Theatre of war in WWII.SummaryWell it is a Call of Duty game and it isn't for everyone.

												Beyond the BS I thought I could ignore (i.e., Loot boxes, microtransactions, lack of authenticity, etc.), I felt, as a free player just looking for some multiplayer FPS action, I would find some enjoyment. Unfortunately, that wasnt the case. In the very short time I played the game, it crashed twice (and I am running a failry powerful and up-to-date PC). The multiplayer maps are crazy small - similar to the size of COD MW2 (the last COD game I played, to be honest). I was expecting a lot more given today's technology and other FPSs in the industry. From what I've read, this is leaps and bounds better than the last few CODs, but as someone who hasn't played COD in a long time, it was just an old game with a new paint job. edit: I was forced to play singleplayer for a minimum of five minutes because only playing multiplayer did NOT register as 'time in game' for the review, but DID count for the refund I requested - interesting how that worked.

												Kind of mixed feelings, graphics are better than ever before but it seems -to me- i was entertained better with COD:WAW. Besides, i dont like the concept of region locks and regional cuts of content and there is no working way in germany to circumvent this. Even if the gore is better than in most (except WAW) installments, it sometimes is just weird - headshots with a small caliber turn the enemies head completely red, like he was dipped in ketchup head-first. This looks very bad. Burnt enemies just seem to be a bit dirty. Thats what you get with the german version, i'm very interested in the cut review at schnittberichte.de. You see, quite off-putting and not realistic at all. I dont know, really. I'd give it a honest 75%,  I'd get it with a discount but this wont happen anytime soon as we know them.Multiplayer was fun when i tried it for a bit.If you're interested in COD, at least get it with a cheap key."

												This Review is soley for MultiplayerCoD WW2 Multiplayer Review:TLDR; It is unimaginative, bland and hardly resembles WW2 in how it plays. The combat is nothing new and does not attempt to make you feel apart of the era. German or American, it doesn't matter because you're all the same. Current CoD fans will like it, previous fans or people who never played CoD will hate it.Review:I made it through about a 4 hours of CoD WW2 online multiplayer without dying IRL. This is just a quick run down of the multiplayer and shockingly my opinion. I did take time to review this so please be gentle.If you're a CoD fan...well you'll enjoy it...because it's CoD in it's entirety. If you haven't played CoD since MW2 or BO2...you'll probably hate it.This game takes WW2 and effectively does nothing with it. It doesn't add or apply new tactics to make it feel like WW2. Where as in Battlefield 1 we have this amazing immersive combat experience, CoD delivers a bland and unrealistic take on WW2.Classes, Perks, Hub and Loot boxes:When you first start you choose a U.S Military Division. Each Division has it's own perks as you level up. Since I was apart of the 10th Mountain I chose the Mountain Division which offers perks that help you avoid detection. Later on you can unlock other divisions and apply them to your load outs. It's an interesting mechanic in place of the perk system. The only time it feels strange is when you play as a German...but you are still apart of the Mountain Division.The loot box system is all cosmetic and just like Destiny you can select contracts that when you complete give you more loot boxes or XP. This is all done at the new Normandy hub which is an interesting add on. It's only real purpose is so that you can see what other players received in their loot boxes to make you jealous and buy more loot boxes. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scheme that I can see working on the 10 year olds playing the game. There is also CP or Call of Duty Points which is the in game currency and I have yet to see a good reason for them except for Activision to make some more money.Combat:It's as if the franchise has learned nothing from itself over the last couple of years. There's no innovation or even an attempt to make the combat feel new. There's no immersion and there's no attempt to make it feel like a WW2 game. You could easily run around for 2 hours and forget that the game is set in WW2 it's that bland and forgettable.The issue I have is that there is only the US and the Germans. There's no other allies in the multiplayer, so all players on both sides have access to Ally and Axis weapons which is very CoD. You can spawn as a German and run around with a M1 Garand. It takes you out of this feeling that you are the Axis or Allies. You're just a random person on the opposing team. Along with that, most of the weapons dont have their original names due to licensing, the weapon sounds are horrendous and the rifles, such as the M1 Garand have the largest disadvantage in the game due to it being slow to fire and weak on impact (Lol M1 Garand weak). Most people in the game run around with one hit snipers or the PPSH.This is boots on the ground, but in the most unimaginative way possible. The only redeeming quality is the new War mode which is a team based objective mode that is unbalanced, but at least adds a little more depth to the multiplayer. Sledgehammer almost got this game mode right.Summary:CoD WW2 Multiplayer is exactly like every other CoD multiplayer except this time it takes a very important and unique era and does it disservice. People who love the history behind WW2 will not enjoy the multiplayer. People who are going into this to be immersed will be disappointed. CoD WW2 is the definition of copy, paste, skin. No matter how excited you are to use the M1 Garand it's not nostalgic or immersive. WW2 is just a name for this game and Sledgehammer Games did not even attempt to build the multiplayer around the fact....that it is indeed WW2.Overall as an FPS it's average. It doesn't attempt to do anything new. Sledgehammer Games and Activision used our nostalgia and ♥♥♥♥ed us while we were down.Multiplayer Score: 5/10 Average"

CampaignEntire campaign is way too easy and feels more like a movie than a game. Hundreds of cutscenes with small firefights in between. The writing is not good enough to justify the onslaught of cutscenes you're forced to endure. Personally, I have never been so thoroughly unimpressed by a Call of Duty campaign. There is not a single one as utterly non-memorable as this, which is even worse considering how cinematic they tried to make it. So much time and money wasted on awful writing.Going back to when I said it was too easy; even on Veteran it was the easiest Call of Duty I've played by far. Most of the time you'll die is only due to the odd inexplicable explosion or sudden 1-tap bullet. I am not great at COD games and it was an absolute walk in the park. There are one or two parts throughout the game where you might get stuck for a bit, but these parts are more annoying than they are a good challenge. Overall, it really looks like they took tips from old COD games, like 1-3 and WAW, which is cool, but they tried to put a cinematic spin on it that just didn't work out. At least the graphics were nice. MultiplayerBest since MW3 imo. If you can run it, you'll probably like it. I haven't had any problems with optimization, but I'm sure they're there. ZombiesI hated all of the zombies since BO1. The zombie mode in this game is great if you have friends. Most randoms go AFK or leave. However, with good people it really is a quality experience. More spooky, more hectic, and objectives/story are much easier to figure out. User-friendly zombies for nooblers like me who don't want to watch hours of YouTube videos trying to figure out the well-written but almost totally inaccessible Treyarch zombie story/easter eggs. Also, breaks between rounds. tbhI don't regret buying the game but I give it a 50/50 chance that the average person would find it worth it. I am recommending this for someone who can afford it. Otherwise, wait for a sale. Unlike AW and Infinite Warfare, this game is actually worth installing, at least."

												This review is for the Single Player Campaign only.I really enjoyed the campaign in this game. The details of the areas were very well done. It's awesome looking at the buildings and forests of Europe in the 1940's. The characters were also very good, even though Pierson was a *expletive*. I really enjoyed Red Daniels' experience fighting in World War II. The sacrifieces he had to make and the great allies you have at your side. Gameplay wise, this is an old school feeling. You don't have regenerating health, so if you're playing on higher difficulties, you shouldn't try to rush. You can only carry 4 First-Aid Kits maximum, so this might cause you to have to be cautious when advancing. Zussman provides the First-Aid Kits. Your allies provide a specific item to help you with, ex. Turner with Ammo, Pierson with Highlighting present enemies, Stiles with Grenades and Aiello with Mortor Strike Signals. I like this style of gameplay that Call of Duty WWII has. The soundtrack had that 1940's vibe in it.I would definitely pick up this game for the Single Player Campaign. You won't be disappointed."

												My review is only for Multiplayer and is a FIRST IMPRESSION review as I've only been playing this evening for a few hours.    If you played the beta, you know what to expect of course.I found it really disappointing to be honest.  Not because of lack of features, they seem pretty slick as usual.  The main issue is even in hardcore mode, it just seems to be headless chicken run and gun in every mode.  Even in Domination, it is like the benny hill show credits.  Some guy sprinting round without any regard for his own life, bunny hopping through corners etc.  I get that this is COD and this is what it is famous for (and a real crowd pleaser in that regard) but I hoped it would be allow a little more strategic gameplay.  To be fair, one or two seem very good already.  One guy literally sprinting around none stop getting 40 for 8 in domination in hardcore. My favourite is still Black Ops although for now, I will play RB Siege for now despite the idiot and toxic community."

Here you can gather with other extremely High Res HD nonclaymation looking avatars to open loot boxes and emote!!! The last time I saw this tremoundous paintainkenly excellent attention to detail was when I made my own minecraft character skin!

												COD logic: Unload full clip on enemy, enemy doesn't die, turns around shoots one bullet and you die.COD logic: Unload a bazooka at an enemy and it's a direct hit, enemy doesn't die, shoots you with a pistol and you die.COD logic: Throw a gernade at an enemy, blows up right on him, enemy doesn't die, shoots you through a wall and you die.COD logic: Keeps same platform, promises a new game, COD doesnt deliver, but they continue to polish a turd.I don't understand developers anymore. If you get countless reports of cheaters, wouldn't you BAN those cheaters? Like come on. My last COD was Black OPS, reason I stopped was because of cheaters. Only reason I got this one is because it seemed promising. But boy was I wrong.I seriously do not recommend this game. I have NEVER once returned a game in my life and tried with this one. But was denied because I was past two hours. I can't believe I fell for this game. For those of you that are wondering on which game is better...Battlefield 1 or COD WW2..I will hands down say BF1 surpasses this turd in every way possible. And my god, what is up with the graphics? I built a PC to see amazing visuals that consoles couldn't handle...I play this game on maxed out settings...and it looks no better than the xbox 360 versions...I am dead serious. Battlfield 1 on Xbox one vs the PC version is a night and day difference. This game, not one bit!Now onto multiplayer, good luck trying to spawn. Cheaters are already running wild online.I guess I will just stick to Nazi Zombies. Even that isn't all that great.Edit: And I always have to redo the resolution EVERY TIME I start this game up...GARBAGE.Another Edit: Plan to restart this game atleast 2-5 times...why? Because the game will get STUCK in the loading screen. It gets old."

												Personally i was excited to hear CoD was going back to the WW theme and as for the Single player campaign and sounds etc i'd say they did a decent job and i like the new HQ social hub where you can move around, seeing other players etc between multiplayer games and such. If you're a big fan of the more recent CoD games i think you'll like this one as well, it's intense and delivers what you can expect from CoD's games.If you're not a big fan of the later CoD's and maybe aren't as hardcore of a player with lightning reflexes etc however i'd say the multiplayer part will most likely not be to your liking. For me the Quick-scoping of sniper rifles feels even worse and more abused than in previous CoD's and imo ruins much of the multiplayer experience. The Penetration mechanics feels sloppy as it doesn't seem to matter much what kind of material the obstacle is made of, you can penetrate thick steel just as easy as a thin wooden board etc. Also they seem to have pulled back on the number of maps available, they seemed to have more available maps in previous CoD's.The Zombie mode i found more enjoyable in WW2 than i usually do, mind i liked the Black Ops 3 one a fair bit but this one even more so, it's intense, fun and challenging. If i were to say something negative about it it's that it follows the now familiar foggy objective style where it's not always so easy to know what it is you're meant to do next. But it is indeed still fun and even more so with some friends.I'll recommend this game for the Single player campaign (although a bit short) and the zombie mode but personally i find the multiplayer broken and there are better alternatives out there."

Call of Duty never really has been ""historically accurate"".The visualsThe visuals in this game are some of the best I've seen in a long time. Everything in this game looks great. Though it can be quite demanding on your GPU.The storyYou play as Daniels, from Longview Texas. Your first mission is D-Day. As you move through each mission you take back land across Europe with the last mission crossing over into the heart land.GameplayIt's pretty fun. All the weapons feel satisfying to use, they have great sound design. The gore is really good too.All in all, this one is pretty good and definetly a step up from the previous titles in the last few years."

I like this style of gameplay that Call of Duty WWII has. The soundtrack had that 1940's vibe in it.I would definitely pick up this game for the Single Player Campaign. You won't be disappointed."

												I cant recommend this game just because of one reason, wich is cheating players, i only have a few hours of multiplayer gameplay time and allready encontered cheaters.I play cod since the 1st ones, only skipped the ones that are futuristic genre execpt blackops2 i used to have high kdr as cod player, so for me to spot cheaters its easy due to my years of cod experience. As for the rest of the game as singleplayer i did enjoyed it despite  being short with some historical inaccuracies, zombies i dont care because nowadays they are everywhere on cinema movies, tv series, in multiple games its becoming older and tiered.About performance well i lowered a few graphic options and im fine with it not too much problems.In the near future if Sledgehammer takes measures agaisnt cheaters atleast at the same level as Treyarch did with Blackops2 i will change my review."

												Don't know if I'm being a hater on CoD or not, however, the fact that I paid $60 for this game enrages every cell in my body. I would happily pay $20 to play this game! The multiplayer (TDM & CTF) classic gamemodes come with about 6 or 7 maps. In which hardcore is filled with players running to the other spawn (there are only 2 in the maps) to shoot the spawns 1 time and drop everyone. Idk, maybe I enjoy one map. I tried to go into the game posititively following the hype. Sadly, expectations were no where close to being met. Get this game if you enjoy no content (small maps, 5 guns per class)."

												It was all fun and game tell I picked up a PPSH while storming the beaches. I even tried to defend it, “maybe this company of Germans was moved from the eastern front?” I didn’t play past the first 2 missions after. Once I played multiplayer, the game picked up. War, was the most fun iv had in a COD game since COD4. All the outfits and what not are pretty cool too. Headquarters was something new and I definitely want to see that in every COD now. Overall, if you have the money, and want a quick fun arcade shooter, WWII is for you."

												Really irritated at the magic superhero German soldiers that start showing up about 4-5 hours into the game.  The first part of the game is pretty entertaining and I was really enjoying it, but when you get to a point where you can shoot an enemy soldier in the chest four or five times and all he does is take a knee for 1-2 seconds and then get back up and shoot you (this on *normal* difficulty, by the way), things just get stupid.  Shoot them in the head and it just irritates them.  Honestly, I'm pouring 10-15 rounds into an enemy, constantly asking for more ammo, because unless I'm using a sniper rifle (AND I get a head shot with said sniper rifle), the enemies JUST DON'T DIE.  EVER.  Even a panzerfaust or bazooka blowing up the landing a soldier is standing on is just temporarily disconcerting.  Hell, the tanks are WAY easier to kill.I can appreciate a game that presents me with challenges.  I'm happy to play a game where the enemies come at you in overwhelming numbers or use smart tactics to take you down, but this ""magic enemy"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is just lazy level design that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me the hell off.In retrospect, while I enjoyed the first few hours of the game, I ABSOLUTELY would not buy it again.

												I'm a huge COD fan but I'm disappointed in the COD Franchise lately and especially in this game. WW2 has a good campaign, guns, asspect, and a better look to the zombies but the the multiplayer and zombie suck. When it comes to playing online with other players and the game itself, it lags like crazy and when you enter in your glitched into spectator mode. the guns are dull or too over powered when shooting at other players. Plus its just a rip off of Battlefield 1, but in its ""own way,"" and a new style to COD World at War but worst. The zombie easter egg thing was super easy to finish and boring after a while and there's a map in zombies where your stuck in a house with like 3 or 4 guns. If you are planning on getting this game I dont recommend it unless you want to see how bad it is for yourself and/or if your a huge COD fan like I am."

												Okay so.. so far I don't have alot of time in this years CoD, yet I can still say it's the best.By the best I mean, it is purely amazing. The singleplayer campain is the best one I've played since CoD 4 (I wont count MWR as it's just better version of CoD 4). As someone who started with playing CoD 4 and WaW I think that it says alot about how good this campain is. The story is really well thought out and it playes very well with the characters. Personally i think it's even better because I have watched the show Band of Brothers which feels alot like this so for me it's like im in the show. But as someone who actually plays the campains for the story i have to say the this one really caught me up. It's constant running, gunning but it's also keeping track of where your squad is so that you know that you can get that medkit when you need it, or maybe you know you could run out of ammo soon so you better kill some more dudes and then go find Turner, that be it if he is even on your squad at the time. But all in all I would just say that for anyone who likes an emotional war story about brothers in the field sticking togehter to survive the war the best they can, this is a campain for you. However I don't want to talk only about the campain even though i could, i want to talk about the mulitplayer experience as well. I was one of many who played during the launch week and I've got to say, it was just a hell on earth. The servers would be very shaky and go up and down and then eventually all servers went down for about 6 or 7 hours because it had launched in the US. But what I can say about those 4 hours before the US launch is that it was amazing to actually get into the real game and see everything for the first time. Headquarters was fantastic, be it a bit empty. The 2 new War maps we never got to play in the open beta were also fantastic because they were so well layed out and played very well in the start. And Carentan, omg it's just so amazing. But did you notice how i said start... that's because now it's not the same everytime. You could get a horrible team without coordination, or an amazig team that absolutley stomps the enemies. However now a bit after the launch you constantly see people who have prestiged 4 times at least (which isn't always a bad thing though), I consider myself lucky when I get into a war lobby with only 2 people who are prestiged and they are both prestige 1. And I wish it were not like that but this also means something good. It seems that alot more of the veteran players have come back to the franchise now with it being boots-on-the-ground and all. To sumarise the multiplayer i would say that anyone who reads this after maybe a few months, it's been worse. It was bad in the beginning but the multiplayer just took a 180 turn and is going towards something fantastic so in a few weeks i think that this could be the best of any multiplayer.(Also there is Nazi Zombies which is also ♥♥♥♥ing amazing so yay)"

												Haven't played any CoD since the 'jumping' began, but had to try this one, because I love WW2 (and Vietnam) era shooters. Normally I play shooters like Insurgency, Day of Infamy or Rising Storm 2; shooters which are way more tactical than CoD. Besides the fact that CoD is just shooting at people and has not very much of a tactical element, I'd recommend this one for people who just want to shoot other people! I am finally enjoying a CoD after CoD4 etc. (all the others were rubbish in my opinion)."

												----Call of Duty WWII Review----(No this is not a pay to win game like EA's Battlefront 2)     They said that this game goes back the original CallofDuty game's routes. They said that it will refresh the COD player with a more classic experience. I am here to tell you that they were right.     -The game gives the player a solid campaign with likeable characters and good mechanics.     -The multiplayer is what really takes the cake. (Cake not included) With pretty diverse maps, solid gamemodes, and the amazing division system, the multiplayer is one of the most amazing experiences that I've had with COD.----MP Divisions----          •Infantry- Perhaps the most simple of the bunch. You unlock different kinds of rifles like the classic M-1 Garand and assault rifles. Every weapon has a bayonet.          •Airborne- With the airborne division, you get different types of SMGs. An advantage you get is more mobility.          •Armor- You get the heavy weapons with the armor class such as the MGs. With this class you have a lot of resistance.          •Mountain- The good old Sniper class. If you want stealth and more of a challenge, then this is for you.          •Expeditionary- This class is onlyy comprised of shotguns. Go for this for more close up destruction.                                                                                           -----8/10-----The campaign and multiplayer are amazing but sometimes the servers just dont work properly at all."

												This review is for the Single Player Campaign only.I really enjoyed the campaign in this game. The details of the areas were very well done. It's awesome looking at the buildings and forests of Europe in the 1940's. The characters were also very good, even though Pierson was a *expletive*. I really enjoyed Red Daniels' experience fighting in World War II. The sacrifieces he had to make and the great allies you have at your side. Gameplay wise, this is an old school feeling. You don't have regenerating health, so if you're playing on higher difficulties, you shouldn't try to rush. You can only carry 4 First-Aid Kits maximum, so this might cause you to have to be cautious when advancing. Zussman provides the First-Aid Kits. Your allies provide a specific item to help you with, ex. Turner with Ammo, Pierson with Highlighting present enemies, Stiles with Grenades and Aiello with Mortor Strike Signals. I like this style of gameplay that Call of Duty WWII has. The soundtrack had that 1940's vibe in it.I would definitely pick up this game for the Single Player Campaign. You won't be disappointed."

												After seeing the trailer, playing the Beta, I've been very sceptical towards this game. After its release I bought it, because I'm a big fan of World War 2 shooter games and  I felt like needing a new, better CoD. Turns out that it was a great idea. I haven't played much since none of my friends own it (yet), but the time I spent was a well spent one. I can only recommend buying this game, giving CoD a new chance (if you didn't like the last ones like me) and have a great time playing, leveling, opening Lootboxes (that only contain optical items) and getting a nice K/D."

												This game is very good. Good graphics. Very hard. And a lot of content for 59.99. I loved this game before I ever played one minute of zombies. Then I played zombies and I am impressed. The only negative is that there is no co-op split screen. You have to LAN two or more PC's each with their own copy of the game. This is sad on the part of CoD since its 2017 and they are still failing at the basics. I am also disappointed in Steam for blatantly lying. In fact to this day, it still says offline co-op available and yet this is not true. Steam, are you really so pathetically desperate for money that you are willing to rope in as many suckers as possible? Naw this is a good game anyways. I am happy for what I paid for. But if some other company similar to steam appears, I will definitely give them a try. Its hard to trust liars."

Server isues, 12 year old screamers and the 'Lets waist 60 euros on a game to hack on' people aside... The game runs kinda smooth, hit reg is a bit wanky from time to time, but the HQ really makes up for alot. It actually makes randoms do things together. Ofcourse, the raids haven't been happening yet but the 1v1 arena is a good start.My first cod was cod1, my last ones were MW3/BO1 (whichever came last), the future, it just wasn't for me. But this game actually does bring back that old COD feeling. No it isn't Cod4, no it isn't MW2 but it sure is a really good game which should be in the top 5 if not top 3 for best cod of all time. It's early to call it.. I know. But I can just feel the potential the game has, and hopefully will use. You won't buy this game for the story, since it took me only 6 hours on normal whilst not even rushing it. But you'll buy this for the 'new' multiplayer aspects that COD didn't have up to this point. Don't get me wrong, the story is really well put together but things like Germans on Ohama beach using PPSHs? That's just weird and stupid. I'd say the game is a 7.5/10 but that's personal. Hopefully the future, will stay in the future."

												Really irritated at the magic superhero German soldiers that start showing up about 4-5 hours into the game.  The first part of the game is pretty entertaining and I was really enjoying it, but when you get to a point where you can shoot an enemy soldier in the chest four or five times and all he does is take a knee for 1-2 seconds and then get back up and shoot you (this on *normal* difficulty, by the way), things just get stupid.  Shoot them in the head and it just irritates them.  Honestly, I'm pouring 10-15 rounds into an enemy, constantly asking for more ammo, because unless I'm using a sniper rifle (AND I get a head shot with said sniper rifle), the enemies JUST DON'T DIE.  EVER.  Even a panzerfaust or bazooka blowing up the landing a soldier is standing on is just temporarily disconcerting.  Hell, the tanks are WAY easier to kill.I can appreciate a game that presents me with challenges.  I'm happy to play a game where the enemies come at you in overwhelming numbers or use smart tactics to take you down, but this ""magic enemy"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is just lazy level design that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me the hell off.In retrospect, while I enjoyed the first few hours of the game, I ABSOLUTELY would not buy it again.  If this crap had started happening in the first two hours, I would have returned this game without question."

												I'm a huge COD fan but I'm disappointed in the COD Franchise lately and especially in this game. WW2 has a good campaign, guns, asspect, and a better look to the zombies but the the multiplayer and zombie suck. When it comes to playing online with other players and the game itself, it lags like crazy and when you enter in your glitched into spectator mode. the guns are dull or too over powered when shooting at other players. Plus its just a rip off of Battlefield 1, but in its ""own way,"" and a new style to COD World at War but worst. The zombie easter egg thing was super easy to finish and boring after a while and there's a map in zombies where your stuck in a house with like 3 or 4 guns. If you are planning on getting this game I dont recommend it unless you want to see how bad it is for yourself and/or if your a huge COD fan like I am."

												I have been wanting to make a review on this for a while, but I was putting it off due to the high influx of negative reviews since I have had a little time off from Call of Duty, but I have decided to write this anyway, even though I may not have seen some more recent problems.First of all, I want to start of with the positives of this game, the most obvious is that this is a big step up from the futuristic cod games of the last few years, I wasn't myself a fan of Infinite Warfare, so this game was a great breath of fresh air.My main problem with all the negative reviews at this time is that they only focus on one thing and base it off that, but they seem to forget the game itself, I like to consider both sides, whether there are issues with the game, and yes they should be resolved a lot quicker for such a big company, I still like to see positives. Imediately when I think of COD WW2, I think of the overall matches, and when I think of that, I remember fairly good gameplay, and having a lot of fun.Personally, my favourite game mode at the moment is War, because it's fun for most play styles and offers a more realistic game mode, for example in war, it acts out like a war scene, troops having to advance on and push into enemy Iines, which means there is a wide variety of play styles to pick that work and can be had fun with in War.With that being said, the negatives, from starting the game at the start I could tell that there were problems, it was taking a while to load into lobbies and the HQ, I would sit on waiting screens for ages, to be finally met with the game, aaannnd.... then have to watch a teammate play the game with an invisible gun for the next few minutes, and to be eventually allowed to play the game, only to realise we barely had any time left.It's disappointing to see so many negative reviews on such a good COD game, and I think if this was released with no loading bugs or connection issues then there would be a lot less anger over the game, and I hate to see everyone see it like that.In my opinion, it is a good game, if you have patience, you can wait a bit longer to get into the match and stop whining about it. I would recommend this if you want a good COD game, I find the game very enjoyable myself."

												I will be covering only the campaign in this reviewHistorically accurate?While I don't know if it is accurate, I'm going to say no in terms of events, but it definetly feels like it. Call of Duty never really has been ""historically accurate"".The visualsThe visuals in this game are some of the best I've seen in a long time. Everything in this game looks great. Though it can be quite demanding on your GPU.The storyYou play as Daniels, from Longview Texas. Your first mission is D-Day. As you move through each mission you take back land across Europe with the last mission crossing over into the heart land.GameplayIt's pretty fun. All the weapons feel satisfying to use, they have great sound design. The gore is really good too.All in all, this one is pretty good and definetly a step up from the previous titles in the last few years."

												Call of Duty®: WWII Review It is good to see that the franchise has returned to it's roots with it's boots on ground gameplay. If you enjoyed the old COD games I would highly reccommend picking this game up. The game doesn't strive for historical accuracy but let's be honest when has Call of Duty ever done that. This game is alot of fun but in it's current state it is barely playable for me, part of me wishes that I bought it on console. There is alot of micro-stutters for me no matter what graphics settings or presets, my game sits on 130 fps but I still get these massive stutters while playing. Now you might just say ""well maybe you're pc can't handle it,"" i know that this is not the case since I have asked other players if they get stutters or graphical problems and I have found that I am not the only one suffering from these issues.Now I am not hating on the game, I think that it's a blast! But until they fix these performance issues then I won't be playing the game. Sledgehammer have done a great job so far especially with fixing up the dedicated servers, so hopefully the next PC patch will relinquish these issues.By the way don't listen to all the negative reviews, probably about 90% of the people who write them only have under 10hrs. To the people who come from realistic world war shooters such as Rising Storm/Red Orchestra, if you can look past black female Nazis and the Swastika's are replaced with the Iron Cross, I think you should still find the game quite an enjoyable experience.It says I have 0.2 hrs on record for the campaign version but I have played around 100 hrs of the Multiplayer."

												Briefly, and subject to update, this is the best CoD I have played in a long while.  Great to have the first aid packs back so that you have to actually work at getting patched up.  Weapons are good ( love the BAR, but the one in the original CoD/CoD2/united offensive was a bit better as it had the ability - like the real M1918 BAR A2 - to adjust rate of fire (slow/fast).  Graphics are immensly improved over the the original 3 CoD's, but that's to be expected.Only gripe I have is that a few of the missions are very similar to the earlier CoD's, and I would have liked to see a couple missions of more known battles.  Also, from the historical viewpoint, the game appears to be attempting to portray actual battles etc. in historic places; much like the Brothers in Arms series did. It would be nice to have some historical information available as each level/mission is completed that shows the actual battlefields, equipment, even soldiers that were involved in the real battles."

												This game is very good. Good graphics. Very hard. And a lot of content for 59.99. I loved this game before I ever played one minute of zombies. Then I played zombies and I am impressed. The only negative is that there is no co-op split screen. You have to LAN two or more PC's each with their own copy of the game. This is sad on the part of CoD since its 2017 and they are still failing at the basics. I am also disappointed in Steam for blatantly lying. In fact to this day, it still says offline co-op available and yet this is not true. Steam, are you really so pathetically desperate for money that you are willing to rope in as many suckers as possible? Naw this is a good game anyways. I am happy for what I paid for. But if some other company similar to steam appears, I will definitely give them a try. Its hard to trust liars."

War, was the most fun iv had in a COD game since COD4. All the outfits and what not are pretty cool too. Headquarters was something new and I definitely want to see that in every COD now. Overall, if you have the money, and want a quick fun arcade shooter, WWII is for you."

												Like many gamers, I was really on the fence about picking up another Call of Duty game. I hadn't seriously played COD since Black Ops II, which in my opinion, was the last solid entry when compared to the turds we've been given since 2013. I am very pleasantly surprised to say that I absolutely love COD WW2 thus far. It represents a true return to form for the franchise by focusing on what made the original titles so great: an intense, engaging single player campaign, fast and satisfying gunplay, no-gimmick perks, etc. The single player campaign might not be unique, seeing as though the market is over saturated with WW2 shooters, However, the inclusion of seldom explored WW2 timelines such as the Battle of the Buldge made it stand out from what we've already seen. I would recomend playing it on either the hardened or veteran difficulties, as they will provide more challange and expand the game's play time to around 10-12 hours. The multiplayer follows the standard COD formula, but thankfully eliminates the annoyingly overpowered perks that have plauged the series since COD4. The inclusion of the new War mode emuilates Battlefield's objective-based game play, and is perhaps my favorite mode. Even though Sledgehammer included dropboxes, the progression system still allows you to unlock new gear at a fast rate, so do not worry about being pressured to shell money out on microtransactions. Other reviewers have cited that the multiplayer is hampered by cheaters and server problems. While I do not think i've encountered cheaters, I will say that I sometimes have issues with crap servers. Thankfully, this is not a chronic problem, so it is by no means a deal breaker. From a performance standpoint, the game is very well optimized and offers numerous options so that you can tweak it to what your system can handle. I had everything maxed out with the exeption of shadows on an RX 580 with Ryzen 1800x, and I got amazing visuals with 100-120 fps. Overall, I highly recommend that you give this a shot. I have faith in the franchise again!9/10"

												So i picked up the game 5 days ago. I wasn't expecting to keep it. I am surprised how underrated the game is. i have 30 hours in it (don't know if steam shows only the SP hours) and there weren't so much hackers, only 2. The campaign is really interesting and intense. I know it's like a movie, but is still awosome. Zombies: i have like 5 hours there and really had fun playing them. I like how they completely changed the way it plays. Multiplayer, probably the most important thing. SUPER FUN. Seriously, now p2w system. The supply drops give you only cosmetics. The war mode is my favourite. I give the game 8,5/10They could optimize it better, add more free weapons and maps(really love the ""Winter Siege"") and a better anticheat system, because i am♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off of comments like ""Every lobby is hacked F*** Activision"")"

Call of Duty: Done it before; gonna do it worse again III've never been a very skillful player of the COD games, but as I've come to practice and put more time into these games, I've found the players are being actively worked against by the very program they're trying to launch. Who cares about the visuals if you can't play the game? Who cares about the campaign if once loaded, you're relegated to waiting several minutes before even being able to force close the program due to its crash. I can't tell you how many times playing this game has crashed my direct x. I've lost count.I can't tell you how many times playing this game has become a pointless event due to losing the majority of your progress from three mp matches you played through because you were never brought back to the lobby and the game crashed. (Albeit, sometimes when you log back in they'll give you your points)Stick with the black ops 1 and 3. Stick with COD mw and mw2. At least with bo 1 and mw/mw2 the studios making their games actually felt like they had to put out a product that will gather consumers. Now that the consumers have flocked over and over again to their little honey tap, they've decided to poison it with microtransactions and a very poorly constructed business model. For shame, AAA gaming. For shame."

												Okay so.. so far I don't have alot of time in this years CoD, yet I can still say it's the best.By the best I mean, it is purely amazing. The singleplayer campain is the best one I've played since CoD 4 (I wont count MWR as it's just better version of CoD 4). As someone who started with playing CoD 4 and WaW I think that it says alot about how good this campain is. The story is really well thought out and it playes very well with the characters. Personally i think it's even better because I have watched the show Band of Brothers which feels alot like this so for me it's like im in the show. But as someone who actually plays the campains for the story i have to say the this one really caught me up. It's constant running, gunning but it's also keeping track of where your squad is so that you know that you can get that medkit when you need it, or maybe you know you could run out of ammo soon so you better kill some more dudes and then go find Turner, that be it if he is even on your squad at the time. But all in all I would just say that for anyone who likes an emotional war story about brothers in the field sticking togehter to survive the war the best they can, this is a campain for you. However I don't want to talk only about the campain even though i could, i want to talk about the mulitplayer experience as well. I was one of many who played during the launch week and I've got to say, it was just a hell on earth. The servers would be very shaky and go up and down and then eventually all servers went down for about 6 or 7 hours because it had launched in the US. But what I can say about those 4 hours before the US launch is that it was amazing to actually get into the real game and see everything for the first time. Headquarters was fantastic, be it a bit empty. The 2 new War maps we never got to play in the open beta were also fantastic because they were so well layed out and played very well in the start. And Carentan, omg it's just so amazing. But did you notice how i said start... that's because now it's not the same everytime. You could get a horrible team without coordination, or an amazig team that absolutley stomps the enemies. However now a bit after the launch you constantly see people who have prestiged 4 times at least (which isn't always a bad thing though), I consider myself lucky when I get into a war lobby with only 2 people who are prestiged and they are both prestige 1. And I wish it were not like that but this also means something good. It seems that alot more of the veteran players have come back to the franchise now with it being boots-on-the-ground and all. To sumarise the multiplayer i would say that anyone who reads this after maybe a few months, it's been worse. It was bad in the beginning but the multiplayer just took a 180 turn and is going towards something fantastic so in a few weeks i think that this could be the best of any multiplayer.(Also there is Nazi Zombies which is also ♥♥♥♥ing amazing so yay)"

The story mod is grate with its realistic graphics and its story of brotherhood.The story mode is not the issue however. Online is one of the worst experiences in my gaming career. i usually play on the ps4 for fps games but i knew this game would be great on the computer. There is ALWAYS a hacker in one of the lobby's i play in. sometimes the entire team is a bot of some kind because they all have the same starting name like {WiN*-}. The only thing that is somewhat good about online is that the headquarters is awesome. even the hq has flaws. most of the players are afk or just not doing anything in the lobby. the gun range and the 1v1 section is rarely used. so overall i would say its a 3 1/2 star game. sorry"

												I have not played another COD up to this point. I don't understand most of the negative reviews of this game. People say there is a lot of cheating. I played the open beta and that was the first and only cheater I have seen in this game.Graphics are good, although I cannot play in full screen because it flickers green the second I change it (can't figure out why). Runs good most of the time on a 1060.Hitmarkers are a ♥♥♥♥♥. You can hit a guy square in the face with a sniper and get a hitmarker, and other times in the pinky finger and get a one shot kill medal. Daily and weekly orders are good enough. Contracts I don't fully understand yet, as the only one that hasn't reset is the one where you get the epic crate. The easter eggs in the headquarters are pretty neat too. Zombies is very entertaining. Spent most of the time running around screaming ""there's so many!"". WHY. DOES. IT. OPEN. ANOTHER. LAUNCHER. FOR. THE. DIFFERENT. MODES. If you open multi-player and wanted to play campaign, it has to reopen itself. The same with zombies.This is a good game, but its probably a good idea to wait for a sale, even 17% off like on the holiday sale."

												(Mostly based on the zombies)It has an amazing campain but just like previously it is rather short.Multiplayer is fun and Zombies are something like we've never seen it.But that's where it ends.Multiplayer is fun for the first 20 hours, after that it becomes really boring. By this time you've probably played every map more then 10 times, got bored by most of em and start to understand there are like 4 weapons worth to use.Yes there is a rather big variety in weapons, But you'll end up playing with the same weapon everyone does, Yes, the op ones...Animations are nice, but get annoying.Zombies was fun, until you start to understand it. As a big fan of zombies (zombie games in general) I thought this was a nice idea to get a cod zombies but not like before. Sadly, I hyped myself to much for this one. Going for high rounds just seems and feels pointless, Features they added where cool, but it's something you have to do every game you start.It's not like you join a random game and do whatever the fk you want. No, join, do this, now that, get 20 kills here. So on...The playerbase, Oh god...-Player 1: left the game on round 3 because he had 9 downs and 876 ping.-Player 2: Is still figuring out where he can equip his exo suit.-You: Are still figuring out why you are playing solo in a co-op game.-Player 4: Walking around as a brainless chicken not knowing the meaning of life.I don't blame the game for it's playerbase. But it's bad.Alot of people dropped the game really quick like I did. You could blame the new battle royal games like BUBG and Fortnite (not that I play any of these) the game is fun and all but it is not what I expected it to be. It gets boring surprisingly fast.I cannot recommend this game at all. It an okay game, but it still has alot of flaws and bugs that I din't even got into.Get this in a sale, maybe 20-30 bucks, sure I guess. 6/10."

												thank god i refunded, the campaing got boring on the 3rd mission, the MP sucked and not even zombies could save it, not to mention the stupid cnsorship after saying they were going to add it to SP and there was like a 3 second clip that had the nazi symbol, they have a f**** femenist on the damm team so of course they had to add woman and black people to a game that takes place on the 1940's even AW had better multiplayer, the zombies feel like i am playing another campaign, and these characters are stupid, i mean damm, we had a time travelling nazi doctor with 3 soldiers time travelling and going throught different timelines and parallel universes killing diffrent versions of themselves to defeat an alien race.over all, thank god i refunded cuz i got my $100 back"

												Runs fine on my 970. Sucks for all the 10 series users that yet again have nonstop issues in games.Anyway, fun game. Sounds are pretty good, animations are nice, but the gun feel is pretty meh. Usual for COD though.Also noticed on campaign a lot of enemies are spongey. It took me three point blank center mass hits with the toggle action shotgun ingame to kill a guy. I used the STG44 and hit a guy in the head 4 times before he died. Just kept getting stupid hitmarkers, which should have an option to disable anyway."

												Pretty disappointing as a CoD, CoD:UO and CoD2 player, they certainly don't make games like they used to!  This game has been ported straight from the consoles so runs pretty badly even on a high-spec PC. The developers have ruined the element of player skill and tactics with boring pyramid schemes of microtransactions/add-ons. Wouldn't reccomend unless you are into spray and pray gaming."

												Haven't played any CoD since the 'jumping' began, but had to try this one, because I love WW2 (and Vietnam) era shooters. Normally I play shooters like Insurgency, Day of Infamy or Rising Storm 2; shooters which are way more tactical than CoD. Besides the fact that CoD is just shooting at people and has not very much of a tactical element, I'd recommend this one for people who just want to shoot other people! I am finally enjoying a CoD after CoD4 etc. (all the others were rubbish in my opinion)."

Totally bogus and such a horrible departure from the approaching nearness to reality of this genre.  Then suddenly, I'm granted superhuman abilities by standing next to the right character?!!  I totally understand having to ask for ammo, etc... but when standing next to the right character allows me to see NEON - BLUE silhouettes of the enemy through inpenetrable smoke cover and then try to pick them off in insanely short window of time?!!!  Well...you lost me at the goofy silhouettes.  Not to mention the poor attention to military realism.  Peers will walk right up to pointing their weapon in your face of the face of others?

												Unfortunately this iteration of COD shares all the flaws of it's predecessors by including sections where the player must drive a vehicle at such ridiculous and unrealistic speeds that whatever immersion  was developing is suddenly broken and you are reminded that you are playing a game with such  jarring  effect that you get the feeling that the only improvement that has been made since Medal of Honour/Call of Duty/United Offensive/Call of Duty 2  is purely graphical .This effect is compounded by a strange sense of deja vu with regard to those particular games. One reviewer here has complained that in certain sections of the game the death of a Nazi soldier ,once discovered by others,would put a garrison on high alert and lead to the area being swamped by more soldiers;not in this game,however. Pop a few Nazi's and the rest just bimble about as if they are on a morning stroll  . This sort of game mechanic belongs to the past. Sadly,despite the creators gushing about the game being a homage ,it is not and it is in moments like the one decribed (the garrison in Paris) that the efforts of those involved in the war are made to seem paltry and simplistic . Somewhere along the line they gave us a game developed many years ago and put new skins on all the models . I can't even compare it favourably to Call of Duty 2 from which it steals the majority of it's ideas . I was  hoping that this game was going to be something that it is not,unfortunately it is neither original  nor a great step forward . The Modern Warfare games ,despite sharing certain flaws,are superior in terms of gameplay and storyline,and provide more for the single player to do with their bundled extras above and beyond single player storyline mode. Unfortunately I can't keep up with the kids on mutiplayer but there is something weak about this side of the game I just can't put my finger on . It feels like I've played it before but in a different and much older  game,and lacks the solid  feel that  COD MW2 mutiplayer had/has . All in all Call of Duty WW 2 strikes me as being an overhyped cash-in,and a copy of much older versions,a bit like The Force Awakens (the film, that is!). I have found over the years that there are very few new and original games on the market;what we are being fed now we have been fed many times over in the past,and the only real improvements are graphical ones. Those people  that could present us with original work have moved on,grown up, and their replacements seem to recreate the games they were brought up on,thus the world of games seems to be quite stagnant . Similar in  many respects to the film industry which keeps giving us remake after remake;but then I've been playing video games since 1976,so I'm a bit of an old fart now,and seen it all before."

												Really irritated at the magic superhero German soldiers that start showing up about 4-5 hours into the game.  The first part of the game is pretty entertaining and I was really enjoying it, but when you get to a point where you can shoot an enemy soldier in the chest four or five times and all he does is take a knee for 1-2 seconds and then get back up and shoot you (this on *normal* difficulty, by the way), things just get stupid.  Shoot them in the head and it just irritates them.  Honestly, I'm pouring 10-15 rounds into an enemy, constantly asking for more ammo, because unless I'm using a sniper rifle (AND I get a head shot with said sniper rifle), the enemies JUST DON'T DIE.  EVER.  Even a panzerfaust or bazooka blowing up the landing a soldier is standing on is just temporarily disconcerting.  Hell, the tanks are WAY easier to kill.I can appreciate a game that presents me with challenges.  I'm happy to play a game where the enemies come at you in overwhelming numbers or use smart tactics to take you down, but this ""magic enemy"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is just lazy level design that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me the hell off.In retrospect, while I enjoyed the first few hours of the game, I ABSOLUTELY would not buy it again.

												I'm a huge COD fan but I'm disappointed in the COD Franchise lately and especially in this game. WW2 has a good campaign, guns, asspect, and a better look to the zombies but the the multiplayer and zombie suck. When it comes to playing online with other players and the game itself, it lags like crazy and when you enter in your glitched into spectator mode. the guns are dull or too over powered when shooting at other players. Plus its just a rip off of Battlefield 1, but in its ""own way,"" and a new style to COD World at War but worst. The zombie easter egg thing was super easy to finish and boring after a while and there's a map in zombies where your stuck in a house with like 3 or 4 guns. If you are planning on getting this game I dont recommend it unless you want to see how bad it is for yourself and/or if your a huge COD fan like I am."

												So I decided to make this review when, unlike some people, have actually played the game enough to actually give it a review. I'll start with a pros/cons list after I give my specs:EVGA 1070 FTWi5-4690k Turbo Booster to 3.9 Ghz1 TB HDD16GB GDDR3 Ram @ 1333mHzI was able to run everything maxed out except for shadows which was at high instead of ""extra"" and AA at the second to highest. I was getting a constant 60 FPS at 1080p except for a few rare times where it hiccuped. Unlike others I have experienced absolutely no crashes. (As I write this review I have 7 hours played in campaign and 50 minutes in multiplayer)Pros:-Visuals are really good, like amazing to be honest.-The campaign was good, memorable characters and almost felt like you were part of them-Better optimized than the previous Call of Dutys-Voice acting was good; and fit what you would expect the soldiers to sound like (if that makes any sense)-Combat felt smooth, controls are responsive-Plenty of graphical settings to adjust anything-Keys are rebindableCons:-While it's better optimized than the other Call of Duty games, it could be better-Although I said controls are responsive, the only problems I had is when you use the (spoiler for vehicles if you care) Tank and Plane. The controls felt horrendous and frustrating-Short campaign but what little was there was good.-Wish to see more of the last area (personally at least)-Some ""historical accuracy's"" were in accurate, but not enough (personally) to deviate from the immersion in the gameOverall I do recommend this game, and if you're hesitant then by all means wait for it to go on sale. I truly believe they did well with the gameplay, story, and overall experience with the game.I probably need to say, this is all obviously my personal opinion so take it with a grain of salt. If you want 100% historical WWII accuracy, you won't find it here, however it is close.I read a lot of these reviews completely unbiased from the Call of Duty franchise and I honestly cannot see to justify a lot of them. People complaining about it being unoptimized and stuttering with an Fx-6300 (which is below minimum requirments for one thing) and people with a 970 saying they're getting FPS drops while not saying what settings they're using. Are they trying to max it out? Even with the setting that needs over 4GB vram to use? Who knows. Not enough detail is known to justify those kinds of reviews. If you think you can run a new AAA game with a 3 year old GPU at the highest settings especially when this game is more CPU intensive than anyhting, then you reap what you sow in my opinion."

												Multiplayer is flooded with Hackers that run rampart and could care less about being reported. Neither SHG, Activision or Steam will do anything about it!  Mechanics of the game are horrible. Completly different perk system that everyone hates. Laggy character controls. Delays in going from one thig to the next. Extremly slow gameplay. Spend more time in the UI waiting going from one section to the next or sitting in empty lobbies. Quickscoping hacks still not fixed so it's exploited regulary. Sprintout times are absolute garbage. Condry and the Dev's could care less. They are only concerned about the Pro-players & Youtubers. PC version is already dead so don't even both. Sad to see how badly they have ruined the COD line with this garbage of a game."

												Really enjoyable single player campaign. It was great to get back into a World War 2 shooter. The SP is a little on the short side, but all COD games are that way so it was no surprise (about 6 hours, give or take depending on playstyle). The multiplayer is fun, but at times can be filled with cheaters. The map variety does feel a little stale - and its a shame that they still segment the player base with DLC (like when the new maps are about to drop, the small player base will split already). While I've taken a 3+ year break from COD games, the multiplayer leveling systems feel confusing and overwhelming and when you unlock items its hard to even understand what you're unlocking or where they can be applied. Its fun, but I don't see it holding my attention in the MP realm like say, PUBG, does. Overall though, this has been an enjoyable game to play."

												I like this game as far as CoD's go however i know indie games more optimized than this game, some people may argue thats ""its just a bad port"" but the bottom line is that they should have taken the time to optimize it further, I nor anyone for that matter should have to google for fixes for this game while many of us have powerful enough PC's to run this game, i have a GTX 980 with an I7 processor and i still have to fix stuttering problems i have with this game, however it seems that some bugs are getting fixed and ive already spent an extra 50 bucks for the season pass, so ill give it a positive review"

												I love this game. I log in everyday just to do daily jobs and all. I finished the campaign, it was fun. The only problem is the campaign works fine, I run real smooth, but the mulitplayer is what crashed my gameplay. When I play a game, I am more likely to ""collect"" than shoot for kdr or whatever that is out there. I am a collector/objective player, so when I play multiplayer and can't do a real fine job of acheivements and what not, that is what makes me upset. I hope in the future they will update this game to make it run smoother. I love PC games, I was born into it unlike the xbox/playstion/wii/nintendo consoles which I have, now. If this game doesn't run better in the next month or so, I am going to delete this game from my computer and stick with either my playstation or xbox from now on. I even bought the deluxe edition because that is how much I love COD games. I may regret it, but it isn't the first time a game screwed me over. Too much faith I guess. Still I will not recommend this game for PC. If you have a console, buy it with that instead. It runs smooth and there are hardly any lags or disconnection from the multiplayer games."

												Aside from the frustrating Tank and Airplane controls, I actually enjoyed this game. I thought the campaign was pretty damn intense and fun to play.Sure, most of the narrative is cliché and some of the characters are stereotypes of... well... stereotypes but hey, some of the dialogue was a riot to listen to!As for the multiplayer aspect of the game, I can't say anything about it since it's an aspect of the CoD franchise I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. I'm still recovering from my depression cause by that ten year old who claimed slept with my mother back in the first Black Ops game...There are A LOT of innacuracies with the uniforms and some of the equipment, particularly on the German side. And this comes from a re-enactor.But despite its flaws, I've been through much more chaotic launch days. The game runs just fine on my rig.I swear... This is a positive review!TL;DR version.- Has its flaws but is far from being the worst COD.- Don't let the ''hate train'' sway you away, try it for yourselves."

The new gamemode ""War"" is really fun aswell being important to cooperate with your team a lot more.Zombies: 9.5/10 I am just absolutely shook about this year's zombies, it is so much different from the other zombiemodes in a good way, with being able to ""complete"" the map is really cool, many different type of zombies, we got bosses and a unique playstyle. Easily the best zombies in any COD game ever! As of now there is only two maps, Final Reich and the House from prolouge, even though the Final Reich map is so good and huge, I would like a normal map like the older zombie games aswell, that's the only reason this doesn't have a 10/10, but I am sure more maps like that is coming!"

												I've wasted my money.  I'll never play this farther that I was able to struggle to get to on my last and I DO mean LAST hour of playing.  Totally bogus and such a horrible departure from the approaching nearness to reality of this genre.  Then suddenly, I'm granted superhuman abilities by standing next to the right character?!!  I totally understand having to ask for ammo, etc... but when standing next to the right character allows me to see NEON - BLUE silhouettes of the enemy through inpenetrable smoke cover and then try to pick them off in insanely short window of time?!!!  Well...you lost me at the goofy silhouettes.  Not to mention the poor attention to military realism.  Peers will walk right up to pointing their weapon in your face of the face of others?  Saluting officers in the field?!!  OMG.  Fooled me!  Shame on you.  I'd pay $160 JUST to erase this game from my memory.  Oh how the mighty have fallen."

												GG. There are people that seem to hate COD just because it is COD. But if like me, you enjoy a very well made epic campaign and you know what to expect from a COD game, this game is a welcome addition to COD. Game is pretty well optimised to get great performance at high settings, though at this stage it is quite buggy. The cut scenes look amazing and the game itself looks pretty decent.As far as stability goes, it needs patching as it is still a big buggy. I have had to start it several times as it crashes out of the game. I also got some extreme artifacting when I first ran it, along with some stuttering but no game ending bugs so far. Not interested in the MP part of the game but I recommend the campaign"

												Can't really tell because I'm stuck in an endless loop of being bayoned by a Nazi who jumped out of nowhere and I can't defend myself.  I guess it's the conclusion of the segment I'm now in, but I sure can't figure out how to defeat this dude.  I'm playing on easiest level but the game in general is NOT easy due to enemies shooting from cover or from a half-mile away.Ok, so I searched for the solution, but apparently there is none.  And there is no manual.  But there is a book about the game and ""strategy"" (which I don't want, I just want to find how to use my controller to defeat this Nazi who won't stop stabbing me), but no instructions on how to do anything.I guess this Sledgehammer company can't imagine the frustration of endlessly dying and being unable to stop the loop, nor how many players will just send it back rather than hassle their concept of fun gaming.  (Just think how proud the player will feel after FINALLY figuring out our little trick.)Guess this is another lame game going back to Steam.  Sad 'cuz it looked sort of interesting."

												Call of Duty®: WWII is a very fun game with updates about every month with the best campaign i've ever seen in any call of Duty ever made i really enjoy multiplayer and zombies because it has very good graphics, cool maps, very realistic, well-designed weapons, with alot of game modes to choose from in multiplayer with DLC maps that have to be bought but i mean it's not like you're getting forced to buy it. The benefits you usually get from purchasing DLC's are new and exclusive maps that are only available to people who purchased the DLC sometimes when you purchase the DLC's you get like 1,200 COD-POINTS and COD-POINTS are credit/cod-money/value that you have to purchase an amount for a certain amount of money and once you buy these cod-points are used to buy supply-drops that contain weapons, calling-cards, emblems, gun-skins, outfits, exc. If you already have the thing that has been pulled out and picked out the supply-drop then you get something called duplicates. Duplicates can be used to purchase parts of the collections if you don't want to earn them from supply-drops. This game in all is very good and has been my favorite call of duty yet except for call for duty blacks ops 3. You should really get this LIT game. It also is very realistic because its something that happened in history and scard all the country included in World War 2."

It has many many flaws (the ones i mentioned the community crying hackers when some one kills them, only a single perk, was released unfinished ect) however they reintroduced war mode which is where i have spent most of my time which is fun and while frustrating at times really makes for some exciting games."

												I have played Multiplayer for 25 hrs 3 days in. I've met 5 hackers already, it has to be fixed before more updates come. The reason for this is that Sledgehammer Games has made the game with the same engine as previously hacked COD games.The maps are a bit repetetive, but still fun if you choose to challenge yourself with other kinds of weapons than just the BAR, M918, STG-44 and M1922The Campaign is only fun on VETERAN mode, since it's the most realistic one. The hitboxes are weird with invisible objects often being in the line of fire. It's fun though, HQ is competetive with 1v1 pit and Shooting Range where you can challenge other players with scoring points as you shoot targets."

												Since there are three parts to the game, I won't give it a whole score but instead my thoughts on each piece with their respective ratings. Single Player: After all the drama and hype surrounding the game, I have to say that I am impressed by the way Activision and Sledgehammer handled COD:WW2. It does have hiccups in random spots but overall it's an enjoyable and reinvigorating experience for anyone who enjoyed traditional COD.Pros:+Beautiful visuals and great sound effects+A story that takes part in several operations/missions in WW2 makes for a nice experience+Gritty and intense firefights almost the entire time+Good blend of Hollywood and realism throughout the game makes it extremely interesting+Good variety of mission types (Boots-on-ground, vehicle etc.) +Voice acting and character enthusiasm is goodCons:-Russian weaponry in German hands is completely wrong (Pretty sure they only gave it to them for the purpose of multiplayer usage)-The Gestapo are seen wearing Red Iron Crosses rather than Swastikas, but most of the time the Swastika is seen on flags so I am not sure if this was a mistake or intentional censorship-Slight lack of fluidity in story as it jumps between different areas quite a bit-Enemies seem to take way too many hits before dying vs your NPC allies who stagger or die in 1-2 hitsSingle player score: 8/10Multiplayer: Similarly to the campaign, it's back to a fun and traditional boots-on-ground experience with no crazy jumping or power-up mechanics. Pros:+Divisions are interesting specializations based on your playstyle (Airborne for example offers a stealth loadout with speed while Infantry offers close combat with bayonets and such.) +Weapon and equipment selection is still relatively diverse+Good selection of game modes (War in particular is a really interesting objective based game mode for those who don't like small or short scale battles.)+Headquarters social hub offers a lot of interaction with other players and offers rewards for being active in itCons:-Although only cosmetics so far, supply drops have made their return to the game-Hit registration sounds are louder than they need to be-The headquarters social hub has an extremely cluttered UIOverall Multiplayer score: 7/10Zombies: Sledgehammer finally halts the arcade style zombies and brings back a horrific and intense version of the classic Nazi zombies we once knew in Call of Duty: World at War. Pros:+Much more scarier and unnerving gameplay+Interesting boss monsters and unique zombies+New mods and loadouts are really rewarding to unlock+Characters have this sense of fear in them rather than being unkillable 'heroes' +Eventually there will be more story but for now it's just as interesting as previous installmentsCons:-Extremely objectived based like previous games so solo play is highly discouraged-Supply drops are also in zombies, except they offer unfair advantages and rigged chances of making runs way too easyOverall Zombies score: 8/10"

												When this game is working, it is great! The only CoD I have liked since MW2, however , I have decided to take a break from it until all the issues are sorted. The main one stopping me from wanting to play right now is everytime I win a game and am in the top 3 players on my team, my game will disconnect and it won't count. Making orders impossible unless I win and am somewhere in the bottom of the scoreboard. This happens 100% of the time without fail! Once this is fixed I will be playing again. Do yourself a favour and don't buy it in it's current state!EDIT: So this issue seems to have been fixed, for me at least and is no completley playable!"

												I am really enjoying the game so far, it runs great on my computer at high settings (I5, GTX 960, 8 Gb RAM) the campaign is amazing so far.The zombies really got me, I was playing the prologue and got jumpscared. That is exactly what I wanted in call of duty zombies. My favorite character is David tennant (I’m a doctor who nerd so yeah I’d like it) and the zombies are really creepy, especially every five rounds (technically dog rounds but idk what the weird no arm things are).The multiplayer is awesome, it runs smooth 60 almost all the time, and the headquarters is so good. The contracts are a good addition so you can earn supply drops instead of having to pay for them (even though it’s more of a grind to get them). The war game mode is a extremely great addition to the game. The cutscenes in the beginning are great.I hope you guys come to buying this game, it is so worth it! Even my friend who doesn’t really like COD really enjoys this game."

												This Review is on the single player game, since I have not yet played the zombie or the multiplayer . I was hesitant to buy this game because of all the bad reviews it got on all aspects of this game especially the single player portion. All I can say is where you paid to give it a bad Review? I found this game excellent!! I had no problems what so ever in the movie or playing of it and I do not have a super i7 chip or a fancy video card. I have a i5 and a gtx 970. and it played flawlessly,  as for the game itself It was well made and very exciting that it makes you wanna keep going, and the game is a good size not short like they say but a good lengthy play that took several days to complete and I played for hours on end every day. It is well worth the money. and I hope they continue it and doing more of these... well done makers  A++ all the way. Now I am off to the zombie and multiplayer part and will leave an update when I am through."

												This is an excellent game! It brings back the old days of COD. While playing this game I have flashbacks of playing Black ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3 on my acient Xbox 360. Although there are many improvements that need to be made to this game, the developers have already expressed there want to support this game with frequent bug fixes and patches. For me, I belive that this game will have a long life spand within the PC community as long as they keep ironing out the bugs and getting rid of cheaters. I've not delved into the campaigne too much as I have been addicted to the multiplayer side of things, but from what I've played so far it's what you'd expect from a Call of Duty campigne. Although, there are some new features like a health bar which you must find med kits to regan. Finnally the zombies. Oh jeez is this one hard to explain. It's a huge map with lots of hidden secrets and tasks you must complete. With the return of consumbles in zombies I think we can expect them in future Call of Duty titles to come. So to sum it all up, I think this game great content for any old Call of Duty player like myself that wants to get back into the swing of things."

The effort that appears to have gone into the game and most importantly the character building does not go unseen. It is a story that will stick.

												I've been playing this since it came out down to the minute and I can confidently say this was the most enjoyable Call of Duty experience I've had since BL2. The Campaign is great. The zombies mode is a new and refreshing take mixed with the old zombies mode charm. The multiplayer is inoffensive and, while bringing really nothing new to the table, is still enjoyable and I can definitely see myself putting hours upon hours into it. I have absolutely no issues with performance while running these specs. Asus GE62VR Nvidia 1060 6GB24GB RamIntel i7 6700HQ @ 2.4 GHzHigh-Extra Settings. I honestly think a lot of the bad reviews are just straight up hysteria. I have a Mid-Range PC and had no performance issues with either the beta or the release. (P.S If you're stupid and don't understand why your 1080 is getting stutters, LOWER THE DAMN MAX FPS. Your PC will TRY to meet your max FPS ceiling and it WILL cause stutters. Lowering my max FPS from 200 to 100 absolutely diminished all of my performance issues. How can people be so stupid) 8.75/10"

												I'll start this review with the disclaimer that this is for the SINGLE PLAYER PORTION ONLY.--------Okay...I'm really torn with this one. As a WWII fanatic, I couldn't help but feel some of the hype. My childhood years consisted of replaying MOH:AA, COD1, CODUO, COD2...those games introduced me to my passion and hobby, and I still love to revisit them to this day.I can feel the spirit of those games present in CODWWII. The health packs, the level design, it feels like a classic shooter at first. Then once you're past the initial ""wow!"" factor from the D-Day level, some of the classic COD faults start to shine through. I'm sure anyone who's played COD in the last few years has been frustrated by the poor friendly AI and enemies who seem to have aimbots. This was often my biggest gripe, having to repeat sections by trial & error. On top of this, it seems that ducking into cover never really conceals you properly either. You're always getting shot from *somewhere*, no matter where you hide.The main issue with CODWWII is it has an identity crisis. The story and characters are presented in a realistic manner, with a historically influenced narrative taking you from Normandy to Germany. At times, the game deals with some very serious subject matter, attempting to convey emotion, sacrifice, sadness, loss - these emotions are then immediately washed away by forcing you to endure missions with car chases (about three or four, if my memory serves me well). I just can't take this nitty gritty war story seriously when I'm bombing along in a Kubelwagen at what feels like 200mph alongside an armored train. It really spoils the experience, because if everything in the game had the same love and attention as the Hurtgen Forest chapters, we would have an absolute masterpiece on our hands.A few other things that niggled away at me: - Completely blind friendly AI, who are seemingly firing nerf guns at the Germans- Dog AI just auto aims for me, running by 5 of my comrades just to come and chomp on my arm- Some very weak voice acting in a few minor roles- Constant removal of control to make way for scripted cutscenes and quicktime events- Some very odd weapon choices. SVT40 appearing in place of a G41/43. Also why did an American GI have a Lee Enfield sniper during the Battle of the Bulge?-CONSTANT MUSIC BLARING IN MY EARS-Germans with gas masks and panzerschreks. It's MOH Airborne all over again.Despite all of the above...I very much enjoyed CODWWII, which surprised me immensely. I don't know whether it was because I was finally playing a singleplayer WW2 game, or whether it was actually very fun. I suppose time will tell, when I do another playthrough.Some parts were drenched in atmosphere, with some very nice environment art, coupled with some great animation. Omaha Beach, Hurtgen Forest and getting shelled in Bastogne were a few highlights for me. I just wish they would have spent a little less time on things like QTE's, and refocused that work on fixing AI and widening the scope of the game a little more. The large lapses in time between some of the missions left me wanting more...what had these guys been up to in the weeks between these levels? It was nice to see perspective change from time to time, but it just left me yearning for the old COD campaigns, famed for their diversity. How amazing would it have been to storm Sword Beach as a Tommy? I'll be replaying this game a few times, and I may even dabble with the MP, but I have other games which are far superior in that department. CODWWII is an eye candy, WW2-themed campaign which often loses sight of the authentic experience it wanted to deliver, but then quickly refocuses and brings you back down to Earth."

 Single-player Campaign	Gameplay and level design is pretty good.There are a couple of stealth missions (moments) that slow the pace for a while.Also there are stressfull scripted moments, like all the previous CoD games.The missions take place in a variety of interesting locations (like occupied Paris), so you won't be bored.There is a new game mechanic: You have to call your teammates to provide you with ammo, medkits, mortar support, etc.And as said, medkits are back! Although it doesn't make the game that much more difficult (just spices things up a little!).Story is nothing special, but characters are believable and seem almost real.You make a bond with characters, which makes deaths and life-saving moments more meaningful (compared to later CoD games).The advetisements focused on historical accuracy, which I believe is not persistent in the game.Most annoying thing for me is,  half the Nazi army in the game are using Soviet Union rifles!	 Ridiculous! -_-Graphics aren't revolutionary, but pretty good!The environments are lovely, the atmosphere is well-presented, and the characters' facial expressions are awesome!So in my opinion,  the campaign is a must-play for CoD fans and those who enjoy WW2 stories.	 Multiplayer	I played a few hours of multiplayer, and because of connection problems I decided to put it aside.To be honest, I don't have a perfect internet connection; But if it works while playing Rainbow Six Siege and Battlefield 1, why should it be any different with CoD:WWII?Everything else about the multiplayer is as usual, with a few changes to customization, classes, and a new lobby called ""Headquarters"". Nothing special that we have not seen in previous games...In short,  multiplayer is simplified and fun; But it's not the reason I recommend the game.	 To sum up:1. Well-crafted CoD game2. BOOTS ON THE GROUND :D3. World War IIIf you've been waiting for COD to return to WW2, this game is not gonna disappoint you!"

LAGCOMP! - lag in general... you get thrown in a lobby with people from all over europe portugal, turkey, sweden.. i hate to bring it to you SHG guys but for an FPS Game this is just gabage! no wonder it sucks- hitmarkers (total joke! sorry but this is pure garbage and doesnt even work)- Ping no real timings here.. nice grafik with these 3 bars (Up to 80 green, from 80 to 180 orange and above 180 red)- ""bad conection to the host"" keeps popping up the second you close the massage... it is a hard task to leave a lobby while this gabage is popping up instantly after klicking ""ok""... again half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥anoying♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- poor mapdesign (to many 50/50 or worse desisions, turn left get shoot from the right and so on)- season pass...  4 month since release... new maps? none! - poor charakter interaction with the map and obstacles (alot of wich you cant even climb) - the menu is just bad from the beginning.. taken from console copy paste to pc- HQ.. well half of the options are still not done like camos or flaq event.. 4 month in the game.. wtf- Devisions.. why did they remove the freedom to select your favorite perks? now select div and one perk!- crates for ingame weaponskins, charakterlooks, XP boosts and pistolgripps... oh my so many pistol grips (Total rip off!!!)- patches... so many halfassed patches.. yesterday 3 patches in 20 minutes.. what is improving? Nothing just new ingame goodies you can spend your money on menue design changed like 10 times now.. real issues not done - again to much hackers beginnig from the beta... i am so tired of reporting (my profile page is full of them, many are banned already but still able to play somehow) Big thanks to VAC or whatever other anti cheat systems they are using right now... WELL DONE!!! I know that no game can be 100% hack free but give me a break.. double XP events are just unplayable!! Every freaking game or every other game hackers.. Some clans and groups in general teamup with these guys to boost there profiles why not perm-ban the hacker and temp-ban the teammates? i know its hard to sort out and it seems to be asked alot because how can teammates know!?! Well after the 3rd game with like 6 final killcams wich leave no doubt that they know his mate is a hacker. But one step after the other.. To all who read this and are thinking ""well, another comment from a whining noob who is just bad"" i am not. I would say i am still like top 5%-10%  in the world atleast! In the ""good old days"" i got banned a lot and from several server admins because they spactated me and came to the conclusion i was hacking... I never ever have installed a hack in my whole life!! What would be the fun just to press ""w"" and the left mouse button!?! I realy dont get it!!!       - Hitmarkers are way of in many rounds (on your screen you hit like 3 times-> ok maybe 1 more would have done it.. after you got mowed down you see in your opponents killcam, his screen isnt even red because it seems you just hit him once!? WTF)- Same sh.. the other way around you turn a corner boom insta dead.. what happend there? Again the killcam shows how bad you are... in his cam he already saw me like 1 second earlier, aimed calmly hit me 2-3 times ok seems legit but why was my point of view just like ""boom dead!""- Same with sniper rifles... KAR 98 should one shoot kill when hitting the chest or above. Well.. in some games it just doesnt.. hitmarker only, afterwards getting killed from like 2 bullets of an SMG-> Total joke-> insta leave! And another tip for all you guys out there: never ever put iron sight on.. one shot kill only with a headshot.. how does that make sense!?  - Duckdiving is like sh... ok its a funny animation and so on but with already broken hitmarkers it is getting even worst because until the duckdive is complete you have trouble getting the hitmarkers you would deserve for shooting him all the way thrue - climbing obstacles is oft just a total joke... you stand on the highground, someone climbs up (even while getting constantly shot in the face) your dead anyways. The climbing part is kinda ok for me because it helps getting rid of these 24/7 LMG claymore campers but its still way of i could go on and on or even point out the very very very very few positive things but... no thanks. This is just pure casual gaming designed to please all these consol kids that are happy if they get 360 no scope kills. Didnt need to be competitive but this.. cmon give me a break!! I cant be alone with my opinion playernumbers dont lie like SHG does-> http://steamcharts.com/app/476620#3mBad experience explained very well-> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOuG2j2rTTsI left out the last 3 COD´s because i just had enough of gettin♥♥♥♥♥♥served for money... came back for ""boots on the ground"" and realy whanted to enjoy COD again...

												COD WW2 is neither a great game nor a terrible game.  It's somewhere in between - let's call it a 6.5 out of 10.First, let's get a few things straight:  some people (myself included) do get these games for the single player experience.  Why?   for all the negative things one can say about MP, it comes down to this:  MP FPS games are basically some ""gun themed sport"" with absolutely no pretensions to realism other than being ""skinned"" for the weapons and feel of the period.  Thus, the idiots complaining about ""black women nazi"" characters miss the point:  do you also complain when you can ""build your own avatar"" in formula racing games when there never was such a driver in the real F1?  For the record, the black female nazis only are available as character avatars in multiplayer.  moreover, the single player mode does have nazi swastikas.now, what about the SP game?  I am about 80% through it right now as i write the review.  the first thing you have to bear in mind is that this game is i guess what you might call ""parallel history"".  Some events depicted took place, and some didn't.  For example, american GIs never fought pitched battles in the streets of paris, as they do in this game.  Therefore, a few things to me are acceptable - like nazi soldiers with PPSh guns at normandy. In a parallel but not too divergent WW2 like this represents, they could have had them.About level design.  This is a bit of hit and miss. First, everything is compressed in space, as is typical for COD. You just have to accept this.  For example, in the hurtgen forest episode you run accross a large pocket of nazis and after you kill them your squadmate is sitting cheerfully on the other side - maybe 20m away from the action.  It's comical and compressed for a console / low attention span player, but that's COD.   Part of this also is that levels look like garage sales - there's crap all over the place.  At one point you are fighting in the front of a french chateau where it really dose look like a garage sale - paintings and cars and more and more on the front lawn.  Less very much would have been more in tis case.  You always feel like you are in some indoor area - never outside.  Even trees arch over the roadway to confine you.  I've been to many of the places modelled by this game. It's a bit hit and miss.  ""normandy' doesn't at all look or feel like the real thing at all.  Paris is well done and feels like the real thing.  the hurtgen forest is a bit overdone, but still more or less feels right.   story: ok, i get that i'm an adult playing a game that also has children as its audience, but the story is pretty terrible.  fake drama and nonsensical reactions.  you know, i just singlehandedly destroyed a massive and vital armored train that was on its way to ""destroy paris"" and i get bawled out for destroying it rather than stopping it.  we just clear out a hotel full of nazis and congratulate ourselves for it only to have the hotel retaken by nazis coming out of the woordwork later.  there's a lot of B-movie stuff like that.  it tries, but it pales markedly to the superior-in-every-way ""brothers in arms"" series.gameplay - hit and miss here.  a bit less on the rails than other COD games, but still the usual bullsht:  enemies will throw grenades at you even when you are in close combat with their colleagues.  you need to hit enemies multiple times to kill them - apparently multiple head wounds can just be shrugged off.  the idea to get stuff from your squaddies is good but the keymappings and dynamics of this are sometimes very awkward.  plus there are some weird bugs where i was abe to get through certain sections without actually doing much of anything (even the first time through).tank driving is pretty terrible and fake and jeep driving is even worse.  the willy's jeep goes faster than a porsche 911!  i heard that there's a stage where you fly a p-47 that's even worse - haven't gotten that far yet.enemy 'german' soldiers engage in banzai tactics more suited for japanese on some island.  but, some nice things too - for example, the mere fact that the major but often overlooked battle of hurtenwald is included is nice.   overall verdict:  not bad, but not as good an overall experience as previous COD games.  narrow focus on us forces is ok, but it makes it a much smaller game than other COD titles."

												Call Of Duty WWII ReviewThe first thing I need to say is that the last time I played CoD was 9 years ago. So some things are new to me in this game.Secondly I need to say if you want realism don't buy it other way it's nothing special. After all it's a Call of Duty but it's fun game, story was good this is perhaps best cod campaign  It took me 6 hrs to complete the game on normal difficulty. What comes to multiplayer, well it's the same style as the old CoD games. All game modes are available  before but there is also a new mode called war and it's pretty funny But the bad side is it only has 3 maps and then there is also HQ where you train and pick up challenges and see when people open their loot boxes. If you didn't llike the old CoD games, then this is not the game you want to play but  If you do want to try it though, wait until it's patched since it has alot of bugs and errors.  I've had my fun in it, and it's is easy to pick up and play game. 7/10"

												Not a bad game, abit buggy and uses alot of gpu ram to run it. The settings are kinda buggy too, one setting will reduce ram usage in the gpu only to use more then it originally did if you re-enable it, then disabling it again doesn't reduce the gpu ram properly. If it ran as good as the battlefield games it would be awesome. Multiplayer maps are small, the points system is ok, but allowing ppl to purchase special currency so they can make their characters better, faster, offsets the game. I really preferred the older games that came complete and working from the box, instead of these cut apart, and re-pieced together games, that are all dlc, season passes and buy to be better content. Luckily I got this as a present, otherwise it's too buggy to buy atm. I'll give it a thumbs up, but I'm really on the line with this one."

It’s highly addictive, and brings a ton of new features into play. If you get tired of campaign, or multiplayer, you can swing into the newly reworked zombies mode, which is extremely fun. Call of Duty: WWII is one of, if not the best, addition to the franchise. I would highly recommend purchasing this, especially if you’re interested in the era of World War II."

Theres FOV slider, theres leaning, a ton of customisation, loads of graphical options that even show pictures to help the brain dead people understand what certain options do. Theres even a fast supply drop rate. I aint defending them cause their game is still buggy, but you all cant ask for boots on the ground then scream at them for actually doing it lol."

												As a true fps player, since i do play all the fps games and I have no obsession with one single game like those who only play bf and say cod sucks or those who are fan of cod and talking trash on bf. I believe my review will be fair for this game.I have been playing COD franchise for quite along time . This COD WW2 has the same concept of previous franchise only the themes are changed and back to WW2 fashion. So it is still boring for a multiplayer.For the storywise, it is quite short and the history is not according to the real WW2 about dealing with Germans.It will still be enticing for you if u think it is entertaining. Be prepared to face some bugs inside and it is annoying. I cant alt tab while gaming, then you will see black screen and ur pc will be hanged. Need more updates.Overall satisfactory game."

												Call of Duty: Hacker warfareThe cheating in multiplayer is horendous especially on North America servers. Many cheaters activly brag about it in game and in their steam profiles. Yet most just use a subscription wall hack and hope nobody notices. Either way Activision and Sledgehammer are no doubt aware of the issue and yet doing nothing about it. If you really got to play this game, buy it for console.P.S. Hours played that is shown for all reviews of this game is only a reflection of the time the player has spent in single player mode. I have over 30 hours in multiplayer at the time of writing this."

												I love the fact that COD is finally going back to the good old days!! Only thing I was annoyed about was buying it in store and not even recieveing a disc, just a cardboard disc with a code on it... so buy it on steam to save yourself some time trying to figure out where to put that beautiful box and steel case cover, if you got the steel cover bundle like me. At least it came in a box since my BO3 came in a cracked case.We just have to pretend that Everything that came out after BO2 was a bad dream.( ok so I wasnt a massive fan of BO2 but I did enjoy the zombies and multiplyer, lets face it BO3 was a flop for the most part. Zombies that weren't even that, stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥in multiplayer, or maybe I just perefer the old school. "" The why did you buy bo3? "" because you cannot tell how♥♥♥♥♥♥something really is until you play it. )WW2 Is amazing!! I love the story, Love the zombies & love the realness. Non of that flying in the air, robot♥♥♥♥♥♥that BO3 +Advance warfare had. This might just be on the of best COD games I have played in a long time ( Since the more recent ones came out )whether you agree with me or not, I think we can all say this is the game that will turn COD around.* we hope * 10/10 I recommend."

												I have played every COD since the beginning.  From boots on the ground to jetpacks.  I will say that WW2 was a breath of fresh air back into the series.  I have played a small portion of the campaign and find it to be engaging and interesting.  I have not fact checked everything to make sure it's historically accurate, as I do not look to video games to teach me about history.  I merely play to have fun.I spend most of my time playing Hardcore Multiplayer.  I do not enjoy regular core at all.  The gameplay is good.  The maps are good.  Some maps are definitely more SMG maps while others like Gustov Cannon is more a sniper map.  I find they are a good mix and well done.The new HQ area is pretty cool.  It adds something new and fresh into the game.  I like it.The graphics are fantastic.  I run on a i7 7700k with a 1080ti at 144hz 1440p.Overall without going into every single little detail about the game it's a good game.  Much better than anything they have released in recent years.  I find that most of the negative reviews are people that probably simply cannot be pleased.  You must accept this game at face value and realize it's COD.  If you are trying to make it into something else then you will be disappointed.  I am glad that boots on the ground is back and really enjoy playing the game.I am currently level 49 on MP and it says I have 1.1 hours in game.  I have much more than that! LOL."

												People seem to be hating on this game for literally no reason. its a call of duty. you know what your buying.ive seen comments saying theres no leaning, no splitscreen ETC. Yes there is. The Lean buttons are just unassigned, and the splitscreen works, ive seen people playing splitscreen in game ffs.Game isnt poorly optimised, majority of people who are saying that probably didnt download the right drivers or looked at the recommended specs for running the game. i get around 150 fps solid, no jutters no random frame drops.Id honestly say this is one of the better Cods ive played in years.They basically brought all the info from the last 2-3 cods they made and used it for this. Theres FOV slider, theres leaning, a ton of customisation, loads of graphical options that even show pictures to help the brain dead people understand what certain options do. Theres even a fast supply drop rate. I aint defending them cause their game is still buggy, but you all cant ask for boots on the ground then scream at them for actually doing it lol."

												10/10. The campaign immediately immerses you in the horrors and suspense of war. While the campaign is amazing, the multiplayer is the real reason to buy the game. It’s highly addictive, and brings a ton of new features into play. If you get tired of campaign, or multiplayer, you can swing into the newly reworked zombies mode, which is extremely fun. Call of Duty: WWII is one of, if not the best, addition to the franchise. I would highly recommend purchasing this, especially if you’re interested in the era of World War II."

I would give this game a 6\10 and its lucky that i will always have fond memories of playing MW2-MW3 search&destroy with my friends or else i would have never bought it.

												If I wanted to kill Nazis, I'd just fly to the US.Honest Review (Broken down for the 3 modes)CAMPAIGN- 7/10. Solid storytelling, great characters. Some missions don't seem optimized for PC (Tank Mission and Plane mission give me nightmares!). Other than that, an overall great campaign.MULTIPLAYER- 6/10. Boots on the ground is back. Multiplayer is still very faced paced, though- This game plays more like a modern CoD title, so don't expect Black Ops 2 and older style gameplay. Map design is really bad.ZOMBIES- 9/10. Genuinely tense, sometimes scary. Great map design, and the fact that we get 2 maps at launch is always a bonus. Super fun easter egg, and great challenge. Only problem is poor voice acting. The characters constantly just shout, and swear randomly, with little to no realism in their voice.Overall- 8/10. Best CoD in recent times, worth a buy."

												---I have not played the story so this is a multiplayer review---Overall this Call of Duty is one of the best ones in a while. Online has a fairly large player base which I was worried about before buying it. As of this review it averages about 18k players. There are plenty enough guns to find what you like, no gun feels like an acr, and the time to kill is pretty solid. There are 21 perks and as of now youre only allowed one, which on one end kinda stinks I wanna combine but on the other it means its way more balanced and in the end i personally enjoy it as it does feel (decently) balanced. In general yes there are a few things that need patch, In my opinion ASAP the hip fire. A few complaints with the menus, and loading screens but nothing insane for me personally. The biggest complaint was I encountered an issue where I could not get the game to open on the correct monitor. (I ended up just displaying on a single monitor to fix it)In the end dont listen to the♥♥♥♥♥♥reviews, im very glad I didnt, I feel I will get 60$ worth of fun. The MP is a ton of fun, and in honesty thats what the bulk of your time goes into and players want to play! 7.8/10"

												Firts of all i want to talk about multiplayer , i personaly enjoy multiplayer but there are some bad things like balnaced teams . There is no balance system , sometimes happen that on one team there are level 10 guy and on other there are 50 level guys but level doesnt equel skill. I like new game mode war but i would like to see more maps there .- maps ( there are very few of them )- Balance- need seasson pass for more maps . I think that full priced 60 € game shuldnt request seasson pass for more content- bugs + i feel good about mp , i am enjoying it and i like that fresh air they added like head quarters , divisons , 1v1 , prestisions for practicli everything + SP is actually good too , i feel that is more like no internet thing like google chrome dino but it isnt really that bad but if you want play this CoD because of SP then i really dont recomend you buying it . If you want fps story in world war thing i recomend you wolfenstein 2 : the new colosus+ Zombies are fun thing to do with your friend , and its kind of a chalange too6/10 - not bad , better than last three CoD games"

												Well, it's here. Finally.  I heard a lot of negative things about the beta version.  But let me tell you about the champaign.  I have a liquid cooled with a GeForce GTX 1060, I have all the graphics set at extra and the visual point of view set as high as possible with the motion blur all the way up.  My ultrawide screen can handle the 144 refresh rate and.......It's frickin' amazing.  I also played the beta and I'm glad I waited to play the final version of the champaign before casting my opinion.  The ""over the top"" graphics makes me feel like I'm actually there. You took the flavor of some of my favorite past CODs games and seem to bring them all back in this fantastic gaming effort. The flying part of the champaign was poorly designed and didn't fit the rest of the game, nonetheless, A+ goes to Sledgehammer, Raven, and Activision!   You've raised the bar with WWII.  I don't know how well the multiplayer turned out, the beta was kinda boring.  I just finished playing the champaign and really loved it.  Played smooth as glass.  If you're having trouble, make sure you've first loaded the latest video driver that Nvidia updated on October 30th for this game."

Pros-~Graphics are top not and super optimized (as they should be).~Multiplayer Head Quarters is freaking dope, I love the 3rd person community hub feel.~Multiplayer Quest or Contracts are cool cause you have a point other than leveling up stuff to play and you can be awarded with crates to win a epic or legendary skin with , always addicting. Cons-~Hit registry does seem messed up depending on the host I guess but it's sadly frequent.~Dying behind walls becomes something to get use to, also sad.~Lag~More LagZombies-FREAKING AMAZING BEST EVER!!

												Before i start my review i would like to make some points:1. A lot of people are saying its not REALISTIC that the germans are using Russian weapons. Yes the germans did use Russian weapons in WWII. 2.  People are saying their were no blacks in WWII.  WWII had tons of blacks in the military serving different branchsSingle playerThey have introduced some fun new mechanics into the mix that make the game a little more realistic. Here are some examples. You can now lean/ peak from cover. To start ,in the campaign at least, you no longer have the ""heal over time"" mechanic where you see the red jelly on the screen and having to hide in cover till you have healed up. Now you actually have health packs that you as the player need to use and conserve in order to stay alive. You also have teammates with abilities that you can use like a buddy who provides you with health packs over time or ammo etc.  Another addition to the realism is the added gore effects. There are more severed limbs in this game than some of the previous COD games, this made the D-Day landing a little more intense.  The visuals, sounds, and atmosphere are beautiful, along with the cutscenes. Some of the cutscenes I was like is this real video or is this the CGI from the game engine. The entire 4 hours and 40 mins of me playing this game, i had a big ohh smile! With the explosions going off, trees falling down, and germans suppressing me, i felt like i was actually in the game/ a michael bay film. The game does have 33 hidden intel just like the rest of the call of duty's. THE ONLY downfall i had with the story was it was too short. MultiplayerFeatures a new game mode called ""War mode"". One team defends while the other team attacks the objective. I myself have mainly been playing this game mode due the game having D-DAY ON THE PLAYLIST!!!  The game does have a new social club which is called ""Headquarters"". Here you can challenge people to duels, challenge them on the firing range, meet new people, obtain challenges which grants you more XP, and to open up Supple crates. New kill streaks on the game. The only con i have for the multiplayer is there are only 9maps. Other call of duty's have more than just 9.Zombieskay this game mode has had a lot of work done on it. Yes, it's the same old zombie waves of growing growth and strength but with a few new twists. It feels more like a story now instead of just random easter egg finding. I know that the previous zombie games had story to them but I'll be honest I was too lazy to really get involved with them. Before playing you pick out your class and character which is pretty neat. Each class offers different style perks and a special ability that you can activate over time. Instead of earning money you are earning a new currency called ""Jolts"" which are used to buy weapons, upgrades, open doors, and to activate machines on the map. The map is simple to understand and finding your way through feels smooth and well thought out. My first run was on solo and I made it to round 14 mainly just exploring and getting a feel for the map. After that I joined a team and we played through to about round 20 took us about 40 mins. During this time, we were able to get the power restored and find pack a punch. So just by exploring alone you will be able to figure things out pretty quickly. There are still quite a few things for me to find out and that will come later. I'm excited to keep playing more Nazi Zombies. It feels new and unique. A nice added bonus is the addition of different style zombies. This adds a new threat to the mix. Feels more like Killing Floor. With what I've played thus far I have been impressed. The game so far has exceeded my expectations. Which were pretty low to begin with.PLEASE NOTE: There are NO swastika's on this game."

Campaign also is a good experience. Very nice graphics and interesting storyline. I never have problem playing this game since the first time I launch it. Run smoother and even better than BETA. The new zombies is very good too. Its so scary and fun with the new mods and raven the zb experience is even better. Sledgehammer did a really good job on this game. Most of the negative review here dont even play this game more than 1 hour. They doesnt know what inside the game and the nice things this game have and straightaway talking trash bout this game. My advice is if u really like COD then give it a try. Plus, there is so many people playing this game that everytime u search for a game in both mp and Zb u will find people straightaway. No need to wait. This game is really good imo."

												I don't know what all these people are complaining about. Sure the campaign reused some of the action scenes from other games, every call of duty does. If you didn't know that going in you're dumb. I don't know what kind of lag issues other people are dealing with in multiplayer because my game runs buttery smooth and I die because I'm bad at MP not because the connection is bad. The zombies mode has some server issues but it's nothing they can't fix with a patch. It's better now for the most part other than the occasional lag spike. This game is fantastic. People are complaining about things that are a nonissue or that are Thor own faults and blaming it on the game."

												When i start to play this COD, i remembered the first franchise games which were the best until this. If previous 3-4 games of Call of Duty were made just to do money, this COD is a very big step up for COD company and for game industry in general. Even from the first mission i was amazed by graphics & gameplay in general.

												This game is amazing. So much new things in this game. The HEADQUARTERS is really Smart. You can meet new people and practice together and even just Sit down and chill together. Campaign also is a good experience. Very nice graphics and interesting storyline. I never have problem playing this game since the first time I launch it. Run smoother and even better than BETA. The new zombies is very good too. Its so scary and fun with the new mods and raven the zb experience is even better. Sledgehammer did a really good job on this game. Most of the negative review here dont even play this game more than 1 hour. They doesnt know what inside the game and the nice things this game have and straightaway talking trash bout this game. My advice is if u really like COD then give it a try. Plus, there is so many people playing this game that everytime u search for a game in both mp and Zb u will find people straightaway. No need to wait. This game is really good imo."

												When i start to play this COD, i remembered the first franchise games which were the best until this. If previous 3-4 games of Call of Duty were made just to do money, this COD is a very big step up for COD company and for game industry in general.

												I don't know what all these people are complaining about. Sure the campaign reused some of the action scenes from other games, every call of duty does. If you didn't know that going in you're dumb. I don't know what kind of lag issues other people are dealing with in multiplayer because my game runs buttery smooth and I die because I'm bad at MP not because the connection is bad. The zombies mode has some server issues but it's nothing they can't fix with a patch. It's better now for the most part other than the occasional lag spike. This game is fantastic. People are complaining about things that are a nonissue or that are Thor own faults and blaming it on the game."

												I'm not sure why Call of Duty suddenly turned into a poiliticaly correct game. Am I the only person here who came here to blow Nazis away with the Thompson and M1 Garand? Also not sure what's going on with the campaign's mechanics either. In multiplayer you have health regen and in campaign it's healthbar. Overblown hollywood cutscenes that are way too long.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teamate AI that never give you stuff even when you spam 'N'. German weapons aren't even accurate and the impossible vehicle controls. No russians, no japs, no brits, no swastikas, just a big heap of Politically correct social justice with minimal historical accuracy. Final thoughts:The campaign story was fairly decent, but I would play the original COD or MOH if you like more historical accuracy.

												Where to start...I stopped playing CoD at Blackops2. Too saturated, silly camo's and targeted at kids. Since then I focussed on my other fps love; Battlefield. BF3, BF4 and then recently BF1. When I saw CoD WW2 on it's way, I wasn't that interested. I had enough with BF1 and PUBG. Then I played the WW2 beta, and something stirred. I saw some things I really liked. Now it's out, and I have had some experience with all 3 sides of CoD WW2, here is what I think as briefly as possible:Campaign - Look, CoD is known for epic campigns. The set pieces are awesome. IMO WW2 is no exception. The part with the crashing train left me amazed. I like the new mechanics very much. Graphics are great, really nice, and the sound is top notch. Guns feel great. Would like more, but then don't we always want more guins in shooting games. Multiplayer: As I said before, I hae been a Battlefield player for a long time, sometimes even sneering at CoD games like Ghosts and Infinite warfare. WW2 has changed that outlook. I am now happy to say I am a CoD player alongside Battlefield and PUBG. It's fast enough to give me what I expect from a CoD game without being too much. It's definitely ""Boots On Ground"" which I enjoy much much more. The games are hosted on dedicated servers, which is great. I have noticed some differences between what heppened on my screen just before I died, then on the killcam it's easily a full second later. For example, I round a corner, put 3 bullets in to a guy as he misses 3, then he hits me and I die. On killcam it just shows him hitting me clean with all his shots. Dunno if it's killcam issue or lag. The Headquarters are really cool. Being able to socialize with friends or other players in an area separate from the game lobbies is a great addition and very well implemented. It's actually pretty cool watching a friend or random player call in their supply drops and see the contents is cool. Which brings me neatly on to supply drops. The last CoD I played properly had none. They are new to me, and I do not feel overwhelmed by them. I can earn them by completeing contracts or randomly at the end of a game. It has never been in face that I can buy them with real money. There is a decent array of weapons, which all seem to have a place, although one or two seem more equal than others, but this is always the case just after launch. In summation I am very satisfied with multiplayer and will be playing it a lot.Zombies: Wow.No I didn't run out of patinece, I have so much to say about the zombies, but much of it will be spoilers, and at this stage it would be hard for a developer to mess up a CoD Zombies game. I think it's fantastic and addictive, just liek Zombies should be.I'm going to give CoD WW2 a solid 8.5/10 as it is genuine return to form for the CoD series, aimed more at the mature CoD player that may have fallen off the CoD wagon after some of the titles released in the last 5yrs. This game has proven to me that Sledgehammer can still make a proper Call Of Duty game, and I recommend this one."

												I have not played through the game as of 20 of November 2017.Most of the reviews that i see are stating: -bad optimization-bad servers-hackers or cheaters______________________________________________________________________________The optimization for me is really good, i have only had 2 crashes but in the single player(after the mission).The servers run smooth for me, no issues and I've had a lot of fun.I can't say that I've come across any hackers or cheaters, but they could possibly hang around somewhere(There are pretty much cheaters and hackers in any game that has multiplayer, so dont rely on that).conclusion:The game is really fun, both multiplayer and singleplayer.

Before this I was a Battlefield player.I have played many WW2 games but I like this one the most. I have really enjoyed the singleplayer campaing, it took me 6.4 hours to complete on the regular difficulty. About multiplayer, I didnt play it as much for now becouse I have been mostly playing the campaing, but I have about 4 hours played on it and it seems to be really good.

												So uh, I've noticed a-lot of negative reviews, from people with less than an hour of gameplay. I'm here to address that and also explain why this game knocked every other COD game off my list of good games and took #1. Keep in mind that I have played every single Call of Duty game, even the extremely old ones where you need to actually pick up medkits to get health back - so don't just assume I'm some eight year old who likes exo suits (I really don't.)So let's first address some complaints. 1. ""German's using PPSH's and SVTs and other non German Firearm.""At some point during the war, when the German's were losing hella hard, they were using whatever gun they could get their hand on. And their uniforms weren't up to standard, and were torn and old as-well because of it. Also they rarely use Soviet Firearms. I saw a PPSH and an SVT like twice EACH in the four hours it took me to beat the main Campaign Story Line. 2. ""Literally any other historical inaccuracy"" Dude. It's Call of Duty. When the hell was it entirely historically accurate? Answer: Never. Play Red Orchestra if you want some realism in your history. It's a fun♥♥♥♥♥game, you shouldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about whether the M1 Garand ping is just the right amount of pinging-ness.Now let's move on the good part of the review - BEWARE OF SPOILERSSPOILERS AHEAD!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!The Campaign was.. God damn amazing. You start off being introduced to your Platoon and it's soldiers. Then, you're on the boats. Heading to Normandy. You jump out of the boat as it gets hit with shells and MG42 fire. Your Lieutenant pulls you out of the water, and tells you to get moving. You rush ahead, trying to get behind hedgehogs to try and avoid the MG42 fire, using broken down tanks and APCs to accomplish this. Finally, you breach the Wall. You rush in, clearing bunker after bunker and even get to use the Flamethrower. You're attacked by a German Soldier and you're saved by Zussman who gets stabbed. You then fight and kill the Soldier, before dragging your buddy to safety while taking the occassional break to ""One deag"" people in the noggin with your 1911. You continue your fight, killing Nazi Soldiers, worrying about Zussman. Once your mission is finished, you find him still alive and kicking. One mission has you fighting for control of a city, in which you actually use a Tank as Perez. You also as Daniels have to save Civilians that you find in a building, even having to do a stealth section, saving a little girl. The girl's sister is killed by a Nazi as the Truck in which the Civilians leave in flees. A few missions later, you get to be a god damn spy. A female, who leads the French Resistance. You go through such an awesome mission, having to remember the correct answers to various questions, before a stealth section. You finish that and then move back into Private First Class Daniels. You kick♥♥♥♥♥with various firearms, and even get introduced to the Combat Shotgun which is deliciously good. After some sniping and more killing, you drive them back and the mission ends as fireworks launch, signifying the liberation of France from the Nazi Occupation. A couple missions down the line, after an intense mission and stealth section, Lieutenant Turner is shot and wounded during a battle. He covers your escape, killing two or three Nazi's before being gunned down in the rain. Falling down into the muddy ground. Sergeant Peirson becomes your acting CO, and he makes you his XO. Congratulations on the Promotion. Corporal Daniels. After a few missions, in which you hear Aiello being a tad racist (but it's WW2, so you know) to Howard(Yes the Major from the HQ) who in the Campaign doesn't have glasses and is a Corporal. (Seriously, how the ♥♥♥♥ did he go from CPL to MAJ, and get glasses? Shrug.) You find yourself almost captured by some of dem got damn nazi S.O.Bs. But you're saved by, Corporal Howard! Yay! But Zussman (who in a previous mission is found out to German-Jewish, and can speak German) is captured. You try to go after him, knocking Sergeant Pierson to the ground and taking his jeep, but utimately you fail. And are most likely to be court martialed.A cutscene later in which he and a bunch of other prisoners are sent to a concentration camp. You awake to find yourself in a building, where Colonel Davis(Who was reffered to as a Captain in one of the earlier missions?) talks to you. He explains Kirasine and what Pierson actually did, before explaining that you're gonna be Honorably Discharged and even given a Bronze Medal for your actions in an earlier mission that appearantly accelerated the entire war effort, and helped out greatly. After a talk with Pierson and a bit of fist-a-cuffs, you get back into the Platoon as Corporal. Going to battle across the last bridge over the Rhine. You find out that there's Concentration Camps nearby but Colonel Davis wants you to wait for the time being. So what happens? Sergeant Pierson takes you and the Platoon to the camps anyways to save Zussman. This mission, is where the game becomes crazy. You walk through an abandoned concentration camp. Slowly, gun down. Just taking it all in. You find bodies of people who were used to make examples, rotting corpses of starved and beaten POWs, and even bodies of weak POWs who were killed just for being ""useless"" to the German Army. Stiles takes pictures of it all, but this mission stays with you. Being able to experience something like that, even from a game.. Is.. Crazy. You rush off to find Zussman at the last camp, before finding him about to be executed by a German Officer, who you witnessed execute another POW. You fire one(or multiple) shot(s) into the officer's head, saving Zussman. You and your Sergeant, and your other Squad Mates take Zussman back to the base. The next cutscene is eight weeks later, the end of the war. Your division is being congratulated by Colonel Davis for their efforts in the war, and Stiles and Aiello talk about what they're doing now, while you talk about how you're heading back to Texas. You meet up with Sergeant Pierson who's re-enlisting and he asks you if you are, but you say ""I've been away from Texas for a long time."" and he nods, replying with ""Well, see you around Farm Boy."" and then walks off. You meet Zussman in the Hospital, signifying he's okay. You guys chat, and once it's all said and done, the game is over. I have no complaints about the Campaign, it's amazing. It was well worth the 60 dollars. The Zombies is.. Oh my god. Where to begin. It's literally a mini campaign, but Zombies. It's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. No complaints there either. It's great. The Multiplayer is just as good. Quick gunplay for a WW2 shooter, but it's also slow enough that it feels fluid. Really, no complaints at all. I don't have a single complaint about the entire game. I really don't. I pre-ordered it for the Campaign, but it's so god damn good. Every single bit of it. If they make Call of Duty's like this, I'll sure as hell keep buying them. It's well worth the sixty dollars. Can we also talk about how you need med-kits to regain health, and you can find them or get them occassionaly from a squad mate? It makes the Campaign so much harder, but so much better. Cause it requires you to think instead of being all Rambo Gun-Ho on some Nazi ♥♥♥♥s. All in all? You're considering getting this? Get it. You wont regret it. Believe me. Ignore all the Negative reviews about stupid inaccuracies. It's COD. Come on mate. Get real. (Also the people who make those reviews have less than an hour in the game.. So?) But ♥♥♥♥ing YES. BUY IT. It's amazing, and I will not be able to say that enough to everyone I talk to."

												When this game was announced after Activision's trilogy of futuristic CoDs, I honestly thought they were going to make a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt at making a modern WWII game, but it actually seems like they went all out this year. I really think this is a great return to form for the series, especially since me and a few others were getting bored of the futuristic setting. Campaign The campaign takes you through the Western Front of World War II, more specifically, during Operation: Overlord and the crossing of the Rhine. You mainly play as Private Ronald Daniels, a young man from Texas. While the single-player did have some framerate stutters, the story itself was amazing, the musical score divine, and the feeling of war was prevalent throughout. The campaign alone gets a 9.8/10. Multiplayer I have to say, I was pretty doubtful and pessimistic about the multiplayer, but when I played the open beta, I really enjoyed it a lot. Now I know a lot of people are going to have an issue with women being playable in the multiplayer, but does it really matter much in a game where the whole point of the multiplayer is to have a good time and blow each other up? Heck, Sledgehammer even stated that the multiplayer is more focused on the players and not the war itself. That said, the multiplayer succeeds in bringing authentic weapons and locations to the game. While I really do love the multiplayer, it honestly could use 1 or 2 more maps. 9 regular maps and 3 War maps is not bad by any means, but the addition of a few more free maps would be a nice touch. That said, this game still has plenty of content to keep you interested. In my opinion, it's probably has the best multiplayer of a CoD game yet. 9/10. Zombies Honestly I'm a little mixed about zombies this year. While I do think you'll enjoy it if you enjoy Treyarch's zombies (trust me it's a ton of fun), it just feels...different. Not necessarily bad by any means, but it's just taken a different approach this year. 8/10. Final Verdict Well, like I said before, it's a good return to form for the series in general. Some things can be improved later down the line, with patches and such, but overall it's a very solid game. I give it a 9/10 overall."

												0/5 DO NOT BUYsingle player is so bad they even gave WHOLE FACTIONS THE WRONG WEAPONS (all end tier germans have russian weapons and there are no russian in the game!! ), the flying missions seem like they were designed to fail (imagine if you put blur effects on a no clip mode 'airplane' with walls of unmoving planes as the sky rides by you), and the tanks drive like a sumo wrestler having a heart attack who trips on paper cups! even the main story itself was lacking. had detailed but obvious cut scenes with characters i want to like, but you just couldnt do it. to make things worse it looks like you tried to have missions with multi factions but you cheated yourself and reskinned them all to be germans. and it hurts, to look at, its so lazy! it FEELS like you wanted this to fail. disneys tresure planet intertional internal corperate sabbatoge levels of FAIL. it was all there you could have had it and i suspect you did have it but more on that later.multiplayer is so copy paste it hurts to visualize. matches can start and end with 1 v 8 regularly. none of those pretty littel custom make your own skins could ever salvage this train wreck. i suspect all they did was retexture and downgrade old cod multiplayer to add lag with no scope hits through unloaded destructable/buildable walls  (why the ♥♥♥♥ do you have buidable walls on tdm you morons!!) TLDR?this whole game feels intentionally unfinished and reskinned every other turn. i suspect because the game inclued Duh Nazis and with the current political climate i can see some of your backers pulling out if you brought attention to this game. dare i say, it feels you feared that its sucess could harm your company.

												Where to start...I stopped playing CoD at Blackops2. Too saturated, silly camo's and targeted at kids. Since then I focussed on my other fps love; Battlefield. BF3, BF4 and then recently BF1. When I saw CoD WW2 on it's way, I wasn't that interested. I had enough with BF1 and PUBG. Then I played the WW2 beta, and something stirred. I saw some things I really liked. Now it's out, and I have had some experience with all 3 sides of CoD WW2, here is what I think as briefly as possible:Campaign - Look, CoD is known for epic campigns. The set pieces are awesome. IMO WW2 is no exception. The part with the crashing train left me amazed. I like the new mechanics very much. Graphics are great, really nice, and the sound is top notch. Guns feel great. Would like more, but then don't we always want more guins in shooting games. Multiplayer: As I said before, I hae been a Battlefield player for a long time, sometimes even sneering at CoD games like Ghosts and Infinite warfare. WW2 has changed that outlook. I am now happy to say I am a CoD player alongside Battlefield and PUBG. It's fast enough to give me what I expect from a CoD game without being too much. It's definitely ""Boots On Ground"" which I enjoy much much more. The games are hosted on dedicated servers, which is great. I have noticed some differences between what heppened on my screen just before I died, then on the killcam it's easily a full second later. For example, I round a corner, put 3 bullets in to a guy as he misses 3, then he hits me and I die. On killcam it just shows him hitting me clean with all his shots. Dunno if it's killcam issue or lag. The Headquarters are really cool. Being able to socialize with friends or other players in an area separate from the game lobbies is a great addition and very well implemented. It's actually pretty cool watching a friend or random player call in their supply drops and see the contents is cool. Which brings me neatly on to supply drops. The last CoD I played properly had none. They are new to me, and I do not feel overwhelmed by them. I can earn them by completeing contracts or randomly at the end of a game. It has never been in face that I can buy them with real money. There is a decent array of weapons, which all seem to have a place, although one or two seem more equal than others, but this is always the case just after launch. In summation I am very satisfied with multiplayer and will be playing it a lot.Zombies: Wow.No I didn't run out of patinece, I have so much to say about the zombies, but much of it will be spoilers, and at this stage it would be hard for a developer to mess up a CoD Zombies game. I think it's fantastic and addictive, just liek Zombies should be.I'm going to give CoD WW2 a solid 8.5/10 as it is genuine return to form for the CoD series, aimed more at the mature CoD player that may have fallen off the CoD wagon after some of the titles released in the last 5yrs. This game has proven to me that Sledgehammer can still make a proper Call Of Duty game, and I recommend this one."

												I'm not sure why Call of Duty suddenly turned into a poiliticaly correct game. Am I the only person here who came here to blow Nazis away with the Thompson and M1 Garand? Also not sure what's going on with the campaign's mechanics either. In multiplayer you have health regen and in campaign it's healthbar. Overblown hollywood cutscenes that are way too long.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teamate AI that never give you stuff even when you spam 'N'. German weapons aren't even accurate and the impossible vehicle controls. No russians, no japs, no brits, no swastikas, just a big heap of Politically correct social justice with minimal historical accuracy. Final thoughts:The campaign story was fairly decent, but I would play the original COD or MOH if you like more historical accuracy.

												So this is my first Call of Duty game ever and I have to say it was  a really good introduction to the franchise. Before this I was a Battlefield player.I have played many WW2 games but I like this one the most. I have really enjoyed the singleplayer campaing, it took me 6.4 hours to complete on the regular difficulty. About multiplayer, I didnt play it as much for now becouse I have been mostly playing the campaing, but I have about 4 hours played on it and it seems to be really good.

Games crashed, heroic guns wouldn't stay in your created classes, you wouldn't be rewarded the exp you deserved after certain matches, and desync.

												In my opinion, I absolutely love this game! There is a few problems here and there, but definitely not as bad as all the reviews say it is. With the new update, they fixed a lot of the server problems wich makes multiplayer a lot better (I have just over 30 hours multiplayer gameplay on record and still going strong). Although the campaign was very short, it was still very enjoyable. It was a lot like all the previous Cod games set in the ww2 era, for me it took ideas and gameplay from almos a decade ago and made it better. Yes, it wasn't no where near realistic, but it is Call of Duty though. The campaign was very action packed as you would expect from a COD game. This is definitely the best COD game since the Black Ops series. I would recommend this game to anyone as it is one of my favourite games of the franchise and takes Call of Duty back to it's roots. A fresh start. If you like the call of duty franchise, you will definitely like this installment. Don't listen to the negative reviews, if you like COD, get this game!"

												Cod has truly become trash, outdated, overpriced, and redundant. Same thing every year, I really put my faith in this game, hoping it would be one of the best ever, but it seems that the series will never go back to the quality of Black Ops 1-2, original WW, and modern warfare. I myself haven't played Cod WW2 too much, I've only opened the game for a few hours, which means it can't keep my attention. I only played zombies one time and it appeared that there is only one map available, which is very stingy. After Black Ops 1 including Five, Kino, and Dead Ops Arcade AT LAUNCH, there should have been a new precedent set for zombies, but they've reverted yet again. Cod WW2 takes a few steps forward, but twice as many back, the game does not have enough content to be priced at 60$, as a matter of fact, almost any game priced at the console standard of 60$ is overpriced. Of course Cod especially because half of the game is sold for a separate 50$, again, just absurd. I personally didn't buy or play infinite warfare, I transitioned from console to pc, and didn't plan on buying it on console, nor on pc, because at launch I heard it had some graphical issues. However, I did play infinite warfare once on a free weekend, and it seemed pretty entertaining, probably the best Cod game that features the exo-like movement. Anyways, Cod hasn't changed, it continues to repeat itself, slowly becoming worst, and losing my faith every year, with so many other great FPS games, as well as other great games in general, Cod WW2 has a very difficult time keeping my attention. The mundane, tedious multiplayer does not keep my attention as it used to when I was younger, after playing almost any other FPS for example, possibly a casual one such as Battlefield 1 or a competitive one such as CSGO, once will notice the difference in quality, and the better price. CSGO offers so much content at the small price of 15$ and BF1 is also a fine game. There are just so many other games that you can buy that will be a better purchase than Cod WW2, if you have a decent build, buy PUBG, another great shooter that keeps me hooked for a few hours a week. Cod WW2 isn't innovative, look elsewhere."

												So uh, I've noticed a-lot of negative reviews, from people with less than an hour of gameplay. I'm here to address that and also explain why this game knocked every other COD game off my list of good games and took #1. Keep in mind that I have played every single Call of Duty game, even the extremely old ones where you need to actually pick up medkits to get health back - so don't just assume I'm some eight year old who likes exo suits (I really don't.)So let's first address some complaints. 1. ""German's using PPSH's and SVTs and other non German Firearm.""At some point during the war, when the German's were losing hella hard, they were using whatever gun they could get their hand on. And their uniforms weren't up to standard, and were torn and old as-well because of it. Also they rarely use Soviet Firearms. I saw a PPSH and an SVT like twice EACH in the four hours it took me to beat the main Campaign Story Line. 2. ""Literally any other historical inaccuracy"" Dude. It's Call of Duty. When the hell was it entirely historically accurate? Answer: Never. Play Red Orchestra if you want some realism in your history. It's a fun♥♥♥♥♥game, you shouldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about whether the M1 Garand ping is just the right amount of pinging-ness.Now let's move on the good part of the review - BEWARE OF SPOILERSSPOILERS AHEAD!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!The Campaign was.. God damn amazing. You start off being introduced to your Platoon and it's soldiers. Then, you're on the boats. Heading to Normandy. You jump out of the boat as it gets hit with shells and MG42 fire. Your Lieutenant pulls you out of the water, and tells you to get moving. You rush ahead, trying to get behind hedgehogs to try and avoid the MG42 fire, using broken down tanks and APCs to accomplish this. Finally, you breach the Wall. You rush in, clearing bunker after bunker and even get to use the Flamethrower. You're attacked by a German Soldier and you're saved by Zussman who gets stabbed. You then fight and kill the Soldier, before dragging your buddy to safety while taking the occassional break to ""One deag"" people in the noggin with your 1911. You continue your fight, killing Nazi Soldiers, worrying about Zussman. Once your mission is finished, you find him still alive and kicking. One mission has you fighting for control of a city, in which you actually use a Tank as Perez. You also as Daniels have to save Civilians that you find in a building, even having to do a stealth section, saving a little girl. The girl's sister is killed by a Nazi as the Truck in which the Civilians leave in flees. A few missions later, you get to be a god damn spy. A female, who leads the French Resistance. You go through such an awesome mission, having to remember the correct answers to various questions, before a stealth section. You finish that and then move back into Private First Class Daniels. You kick♥♥♥♥♥with various firearms, and even get introduced to the Combat Shotgun which is deliciously good. After some sniping and more killing, you drive them back and the mission ends as fireworks launch, signifying the liberation of France from the Nazi Occupation. A couple missions down the line, after an intense mission and stealth section, Lieutenant Turner is shot and wounded during a battle. He covers your escape, killing two or three Nazi's before being gunned down in the rain. Falling down into the muddy ground. Sergeant Peirson becomes your acting CO, and he makes you his XO. Congratulations on the Promotion. Corporal Daniels. After a few missions, in which you hear Aiello being a tad racist (but it's WW2, so you know) to Howard(Yes the Major from the HQ) who in the Campaign doesn't have glasses and is a Corporal. (Seriously, how the ♥♥♥♥ did he go from CPL to MAJ, and get glasses? Shrug.) You find yourself almost captured by some of dem got damn nazi S.O.Bs. But you're saved by, Corporal Howard! Yay! But Zussman (who in a previous mission is found out to German-Jewish, and can speak German) is captured. You try to go after him, knocking Sergeant Pierson to the ground and taking his jeep, but utimately you fail. And are most likely to be court martialed.A cutscene later in which he and a bunch of other prisoners are sent to a concentration camp. You awake to find yourself in a building, where Colonel Davis(Who was reffered to as a Captain in one of the earlier missions?) talks to you. He explains Kirasine and what Pierson actually did, before explaining that you're gonna be Honorably Discharged and even given a Bronze Medal for your actions in an earlier mission that appearantly accelerated the entire war effort, and helped out greatly. After a talk with Pierson and a bit of fist-a-cuffs, you get back into the Platoon as Corporal. Going to battle across the last bridge over the Rhine. You find out that there's Concentration Camps nearby but Colonel Davis wants you to wait for the time being. So what happens? Sergeant Pierson takes you and the Platoon to the camps anyways to save Zussman. This mission, is where the game becomes crazy. You walk through an abandoned concentration camp. Slowly, gun down. Just taking it all in. You find bodies of people who were used to make examples, rotting corpses of starved and beaten POWs, and even bodies of weak POWs who were killed just for being ""useless"" to the German Army. Stiles takes pictures of it all, but this mission stays with you. Being able to experience something like that, even from a game.. Is.. Crazy. You rush off to find Zussman at the last camp, before finding him about to be executed by a German Officer, who you witnessed execute another POW. You fire one(or multiple) shot(s) into the officer's head, saving Zussman. You and your Sergeant, and your other Squad Mates take Zussman back to the base. The next cutscene is eight weeks later, the end of the war. Your division is being congratulated by Colonel Davis for their efforts in the war, and Stiles and Aiello talk about what they're doing now, while you talk about how you're heading back to Texas. You meet up with Sergeant Pierson who's re-enlisting and he asks you if you are, but you say ""I've been away from Texas for a long time."" and he nods, replying with ""Well, see you around Farm Boy."" and then walks off. You meet Zussman in the Hospital, signifying he's okay. You guys chat, and once it's all said and done, the game is over. I have no complaints about the Campaign, it's amazing. It was well worth the 60 dollars. The Zombies is.. Oh my god. Where to begin. It's literally a mini campaign, but Zombies. It's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. No complaints there either. It's great. The Multiplayer is just as good. Quick gunplay for a WW2 shooter, but it's also slow enough that it feels fluid. Really, no complaints at all. I don't have a single complaint about the entire game. I really don't. I pre-ordered it for the Campaign, but it's so god damn good. Every single bit of it. If they make Call of Duty's like this, I'll sure as hell keep buying them. It's well worth the sixty dollars. Can we also talk about how you need med-kits to regain health, and you can find them or get them occassionaly from a squad mate? It makes the Campaign so much harder, but so much better. Cause it requires you to think instead of being all Rambo Gun-Ho on some Nazi ♥♥♥♥s. All in all? You're considering getting this? Get it. You wont regret it. Believe me. Ignore all the Negative reviews about stupid inaccuracies. It's COD. Come on mate. Get real. (Also the people who make those reviews have less than an hour in the game.. So?) But ♥♥♥♥ing YES. BUY IT. It's amazing, and I will not be able to say that enough to everyone I talk to."

												The campaign for Call of Duty WWII was.. surprinsgly good.Has its ups and downs but really feels like a classic CoD campaign with some classic Medal of Honor vibes in a couple missions, probably one of my favourite D-Day missions in gaming too, but really has a great WWII campaign.Some of the main downfalls for me was Sledgehammer's attention to detail, or lackthereof, as the amount of MG15s, SVT40s, PPSh 41s, and Wz. 38ms(Karabin, ingame) found on the German Soldiers was a bit off, Starting one of the levels in the Battle of the Bulge with a Lee Enfield was also more than a little weird.I can't really speak for optimization as I'm running this off a pretty powerful rig, but it ran fine for me and looks better than I had imagined it would. I ran it all on Ultra and was getting 90fps throughout most of the game, the main dips would happen in the prerendered cgi cutscenes of all places, where some would run at 60fps and others would dip down to as low as 30fps, but thats probably an issue with the rendering and not the game itself per se.I can defintely recommend this game when its at least -50% off for a sale for the campaign, as I'm not touching the multiplayer or zombies since I'm not interested in that.Rig Specs:OS: Windows 10 64-bitCPU:  Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHzGPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070RAM: 16gb"

												Well, i´ve been playing Call of Duty since my brother came with a copy of the first Call of duty back in 2003. I enjoyed the franchize alot, playing multiplayer since 2005, completed the Call Of duty 4 campaign maybe 10 times, competetive on mw2 and cod4 promod but stopped playing after MW3. I still bought the new games in hope that they became something that reminded me of the older games, but never really enjoyed them. But now for the first time since MW3 I actually enjoyed a Call of duty game It´s not perfect but they are heading towards the right way, give the game a chance and you will most certainly enjoy it, maybe wait for a sale and it will be 100 % worth it. The game is in class with Call of duty 3, which was not perfect but good enough for you to enjoy. The graphics is really good and the sound effects are great, the story so far is good but not great.

												I thought this year would've been THE year for Call of Duty. They hyped it so much at the reveal about the single playet how 'authentic' it would be. It's a shame to see German soldiers running around with Russian sub machine guns like the PPSH. Then they freaking sencored every little thing this big war is so well-known for. The nazi symbolism, the racism and even the sexism. When they make a campaign about World War II, this must be added. You can always give the game I enable/disable button, so people can choose for there very own if they want such things in. When I saw that every officer worn a Iron Cross, I refunded the game because nothing authentic is seen back in the game. When this would be a 25/30 dollars game then it would be worth it. But not a Full AAA price game.Then one job they did very well are the sounds of the game. These are just amazing and it makes you feel like you're a little bit in the war with a good headphone or set of speakers. Another thing that wasn't bad, but could be better, were the graphics. Graphics look smooth and ran okay with my computer (1080, i7-7700K).Multiplayer I won't talk about, because I think it's just the same like every year only now they put in a World War II style with weapons from back in the days. Not a major switch.Overall it just isn't worth it in the current state of the game. It feels like there should a come a major patch for every thing in the single player that isn't right, but I think that they're to proud to admit the big fouls they made. Just not buying it yet, becausd it's too expensive for what you get."

												Honestly don't know what all the anger is about, first CoD game since Black Ops I purchased. The weapon choices are a bit disappointing, and a lack of a Pacific campaign is saddening. Multiplayer is enjoyable and fairly balanced, zombies is entertaining but repetitive. Only real downsides I see in this game are the lack of weapon choices and some painful historical inaccuracies in the campaign _cough couch for some reason a sherman 76mm gun can't penetrate a Pz IV from the front at 100m cough cough_Overall very enjoyable I even purchased the 100$ version."

												As a huge CoD fan, having participated in LAN events, I truly believe the guys complaining have never played CoD before. Seriously, realism? Long campaign? You buy the game for Multiplayer and Zombies, which is well like the older CoDs. I'm glad they went to a fast-paced WWII instead of that futuristic stuff. Now to hope they go back to Modern Warfare as well :D"

												I preordered this on Sept 30 thinking it would be a lot better than BO3.(The beta was great) Well after playing the lackluster campaign for almost an hour I tried to play multiplayer while my friends on the west coast were playing multiplayer. And I gave up around 3 am when the server status on their website said all platforms were up. I'll never pre-order another game. I'll never fool with COD again either. I'd literally rather go hiking than play games these days the market is oversaturated with corporate filth that won't even admit 60 dollars won't buy a full game anymore.

												The capaign was super cool but it felt short. Also, I feel this ""you are the guy who does everything in this war"" it's like you are the only hope. Also, in one of the mission you must drive a tank. This is the second time I drive a tank in CoD and I didn't like it. When CoD experiments it's not going to end well. I was surpriesd about my experience with the plane mission. That was awesome ! But the tank mission was soooo bad. I had to respawn almost 15 times ! THAT'S CRAZY !Also, the multiplayer is just like CoD, dives, bad netcode, shooting behind brick walls. It can be fun, but they must fix these problems first."

												Although I am only a few hours into the campaign, I have to take a minute to write this review (which I'll update later as I get more hours in).  I really don't understand the negative reviews I've seen posted, especially those claiming to have bad performance or crashes.  I know it can happen but while its easy to blame the game it could also be the user's system.  I haven't had a single issue, crash or performance problem since the very first launch of this game.  I am absolutely impressed by the game's engine, the graphics are astounding and I'm really enjoying the campaign.  I feel like I'm participating in my own ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"".  That being said, I understand the complainst about historical accuracy and all that. However, I am not going to give this game a negative rating because at the end of the day, this is a game.  If I wanted a history lesson I'd watch the History Channel.  What I'm looking for is entertainment, solid game play, kick butt graphics/sound and the feeling I'm getting my money's worth.  CoD: WWII delivers on all of that for me.  Additionally, I also speak German and hate when WWII games have Americans speaking trash German and nothing makes sense.  They did the right thing by hiring native speakers and using real dialogue.  Thank you.  While repetitive, at least its authentic.For those wondering about system performance and all that because of the reviews touting issues, here are my system specs for which I experience ZERO problems:*Windows 7 Professional*MSI Z97 Gaming 7 Motherboard*Intel i7 4790k 4ghz CPU*Corsair Vengeance Pro 16GB 2400MHz RAM*2x Sapphire Radeon R9 290X 4GB GDDR5 TRI-X OC Ver."

												I really don't understand all the hate for this game. The campaign is very well done, they removed health regeneration in favour of medkits. Team members are actually useful and provide you with interesting support features. I see a lot of kids ranting about the presence of Soviet guns on the field, which is actually accurate because many soviet weapons were captured and re-distributed among German troops. Pak36(r) for example was a converted version of the 76mm ZiS-3 field gun, SVT-40 were often captured and used since German did not have reliable semi-automatic rifles until 1943 with the introduction of the G-43, and still in few numbers (The G-41 was unreliable and jammed very often)."

Just wanna say dont listen to 90% of these reviews since its only battlefield fans who are circlejerking and following the hate train cause you cant apparently like COD anymore. I love battlefield and COD, 2 completely different games. I love CODs more fast and arcade playstyle and i like battlefield playstyle a bit more slow bigger maps not really realistic either but still good.So people who are hesitating because of the reviews. Please i promise you will probably like it! Sure it can be good to read reviews but when it comes to CODs reviews... Dont listen to 80% of them."

												So far, its pretty bad. Having just done the ridiculous jeep mission, complete with ramps and comedy laps of the courtyard shooting everyone in the back, I'm not really enjoying it.- graphics - ugly. The ground in particular looks pretty nasty on normal settings. Compared to Battlefield 1 this feels like a 5 year old game. I could try ramping up all the settings but when most stuff is on ""normal"" and it still looks terrible, it seems like a bad sign. BF1 looked amazing in comparison on whatever it defaulted to on my fairly average PC.- gameplay - cliched in the extreme, and every single piece so far has been done before, and often better - compare the tank sections in Battlefield 1 to this. The beach landing opening feels exactly like the first time it was done in Medal Of Honor, complete with the homing bullets from the enemy. Often finding that the enemy soldiers know exactly where I am at all times, so peeking out from cover results in an instant barrage of fire from these telepathic AIs.- controls - clunky - many times I've flipped the mousewheel to swap weapons, and it selects the same weapon again and requires a second flip to move to the 2nd weapon, seems to happen a lot after picking up a new weapon. Got stuck on scenery quite often too, and it seems reluctant to crouch when stopping moving, so I often end up still standing when arriving at a new piece of cover.- unskippable cut scenes, including the good-old fall-on-the-floor-blurred-vision one that happens in every single FPS ever made it seems >:(- characters and story - so far, so dull. I don't care about any of them, just something I have to sit through until it lets me take back control again. It's like a 12 year old wrote an episode of Band of Brothers.- overall - 4/10 so far. Hope it gets better but not really expecting it to. BF1 had issues but it was twice the fun I am having here, mostly because it didn't feel like a 5 to 10 year old game released in 2017."

												Allright, I am not someone who posts reviews a lot. But this COD deserves one from me, for many reasons.As someone who started COD with COD1 GOTY Edition and quitted COD after BO I was afraid this one would've been a bummer. However the Campaign is amazing, reminds me of the older days in COD where it was all about the Campaign and not so much about online competitve gameplay.The Cinematics are outstanding, a couple left me with the idea it was actually filmed on set instead of animated.The Gameplay is quickpased, and actually makes you feel part of something big. The Graphics are okay, but thats just because my PC is pretty low-end for todays standard, still playable on 60fps!Actually surprised campaign covers over 6hrs of gameplay!--Incoming spoilers, don't read past this line if you are still playing campaign:--I loved the aspects as a fighter and a tank driver, however the tank driver part was a pain in the but.I Miss an ending like in the older days of COD, why does the Campaign not end in Berlin(Possible DLC;) )?This game is a safe buy for people who want to compare it to the older days of COD!Welldone on the game!"

												I really do not understand all the negatvie reviews. Zombies is a main reason why I get a COD game. Ever since BO2, I have been a huge fan of Call of Duty Zombies. I have only played one round to round 18 but I can already tell you that it was damn well amazing. The music is eery and the zombies were creepy which, when mixed together, gives your game a lot of sp00kiness. And unlike Infinite Warfare Zombies (other than Zombies In Spaceland which i really enjoyed), I can already tell that SledgeHammer is put lots of care. love, and time into each aspect of their zombies map and will continue to do so in the future. The multiplayer is really good, one thing i dont like about it is that its really fast paced and its not in a way where one would start off with okay weapons and as they rank up the weapons get better and better. You can be like level 2 and get the PPSH which is a really good weapon but other than that, what are you gonna expect, its a cod game. And last, but not least, the campaign. I have only gotten to one mission but it is so beautiful. The sounds are so real and the story is so beautifully orchestrated. If you loved Black Ops and World at War, trust me,you will truly love this campaign."

												Here's an honest review:- Gameplay, mechanics, customization: Really ♥♥♥♥ing good, one of the best Call of Duties in that regard. With Battlefield 1 I found that the game got really stail very quickly and didn't offer me much variety in what I could do. This game provides a ♥♥♥♥ ton of variety, customization and gameplay mechanics to keep you entertained. Daily/Weekly challenges, headquarters, paintjobs, variants (asthetic only), and a pleathora of other things. I honestly have to hand it to SHG for being able to provide the level of debth that they have for a World War 2 game (where there weren't many guns to be honest and there weren't any variants or modifications), yet SHG provided that whilst still keeping it relatively believable, props. Anyone who says the gameplay is bad is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing retard who only hates on the game for purely hating on the game. Would I say this game is worth $60? Yes, I go to watch a 2 hour movie for $10-$15, and I've already gotten 8+ hours of enjoyment out of this game, so I can't say it's not worth $60. - Zombies: Holy ♥♥♥♥ this is legitimately the best zombies experience that I have ever had, it truly brings me back to World at War, where things were gritty and gruesome. None of that flambouyant spaceland disco zombie♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was a fan ever since the inception of Zombies and I'm glad to see it go back to what it began as: a dark, gruesome story. Zombies it truly something to behold in this game. I really love the gameplay. However, the one thing that I am very very very irritated about is that there is no rounds survived leaderboard! WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥! Also if a host migrates it kicks everyone out and you lose everything... so that is♥♥♥♥♥♥too. ALSO leveling in zombies takes way to ♥♥♥♥ing long, like 4 hours of gameplay = 4 levels... dafuq. So on a gameplay level zombies is ♥♥♥♥ing great, but the technical part is a bit lacking and unerwhelming.- Multiplayer: This♥♥♥♥♥♥is ♥♥♥♥ing fun. I didn't think that I would have this much fun. Everything just feels clean, I don't know how else to say it. The game lacks a bit in the scorestreak area and I don't ever recall usuing a single scorestreak yet... it's just super hard to be able to survive in this game for 4+ kills, even though I have a 3:1 win/loss and a 2.67 K/D scorestreaks are just really ♥♥♥♥ing hard to get. The gamemodes are absolutely great. I love the new War gamemode, it's my new all time favorite mode for CoD. I love the same game mode in Battlefield and I like what they've done in CoD with a few unique tweaks, everything feels really balanced (except for snipers I think they are super ♥♥♥♥ing broken right now... like every ♥♥♥♥ing half witted person is just running around and seemingly never missing shots... snipers are always 1 shot and never have hit markers.... busted AF). So yeah multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ing great and there is a lot to do: prestige, prestige guns, prestige division, rank up different divisions, go to headquarters, achieve little easter eggs in headquarters. Also I ♥♥♥♥ing love the 1v1 arena, I've  played more 1v1 in HQ than the actual multiplayer and I've played a bit of MP... 1v1 is just super fun and laid back with 5-10 people talking and dueling it out, such a blast (best innovative game feature TBH).- Special Butterfly Treatment: Also the best Call of Duty in that regard... I get they would be bombarded with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SJWs saying that a game based on historical FACTS was racist or bigotted (if they didn't censor stuff), but I'm disappointed to see them give in. Personally I don't mind all of the causes, but I play a game for immersion and when I see something and in my head I go: ""wait, that's not what ♥♥♥♥ing happened"" it sort of irritates me and pulls me out of the game. Like it's kind of stupid. It's a double edged sword I get it, but it's a pitty Sledgehammer gave in. Also I was looking through the calling cards and there is an LGBT calling card where a LGBT flag is hovering over the HQ.... ummm???? Under no circumstance would that have EVER been a thing during WW2 (I'm not saying it was right), but it was literally illegal to be a homosexual in the military back then. This kind of stuff is littered in the game and not that I'm against these sort of movements (to clarify), but from a historical perspective (to clarify once more to any social justice butterfly that can't comprehend things correctly) it's just really annoying and seperates you from the game.So to summarize the gameplay is by far the best I've ever seen in a Call of Duty both in mechanics and debth, however the small inaccuracies can be pretty annoying. All in all this is my favorite CoD since MW3. Props."

												so here it is i haven't bought a cod game since blacks ops , but i gotta say i really like this game because after seeing and playing the other cod games at friends houses i didn't like where they were taking given that at the time titanfall was way better sadly players didn't switch to it, but i digress this is a very good call of duty i say it's on par with waw, the singler player was a good story because it was something new story wise bc other old og cod games did all the big ww2 moments in history so that was refreshing, the multiplayer was good and balanced compare to the other cod games like mw2 switch was so badly balanced and fal wasn't even centred right for months but ww2 was by far the most balanced cod at launch, so in my opinion this was one of the better cods worthy of a purchase, i recommend this to any old school cod player   8/10"

												Overall: 7/10If you can get it on sale for like $49.99 or less then game is definitely worth it.PC optimaztion is good. Beta seemed to run better than current version, occaisonal lock up in games. Runs on pretty much anything, game was playable on my GT 940MX @ 720P High settings.If you enjoy CoD games, this is a step up from the previous iteration and will enjoy it. HOWEVER a stepdown from Treyarch's CoD: Black Ops 3.ZOMBIES MODEPROS+Zombies mode is vastly improved from Exo Zombies, rivals 3arc's zombies. Brings a Deadspace vibe to it.+A lot of things to do, objective based with step by step instructions.+Challenging compared to Treyarch zombies+Fun to play/Good mechanics.+Jumpscares are actually scary if you get focused in the game.CONS-Game will sometimes kick you out of your game if the server goes down.-Theres A LOT of things to learn, big learning curve.-DC from lots of multiplayer games, not sure if me but I ended up losing my lobby and going into a solo match.CAMPAIGNPROS+Fun, reminds me of WaW days.+Good plot+Challenging, different health system makes it harder to survive.CONS-None yet.MULTIPLAYERPROS+Multiplayer games go by super fast, are fun once you figure out which guns to use.There are a few gripes for me though.+Supplydrops aren't P2W trash+Lots of contracts/Tasks (BO3 lagged with this at launch)+Easy to learn the new Division class system.CONS-No gamepad support in MP. Campaign and zombies have it.-No splitscreen support. Treyarch did it without a problem, why can't Sledgehammer?-Raven could have ported the game better, when changing gamemodes a dialogue box in steam pops up with a launch flag and imo annoying as hell.-Menus are annoying to navigate if you don't have a controller.-No anti-cheat system implemented. Like why?-No consistent text chat."

I thought it would of featured more allies instead of mighty America who always comes late to the fight. It should of been called big red 1 two.

												I'd played Call of Duty 2 Multiplayer for 7 years as a professional. All the characters, episodes, cities and missions are still somewhere in my mind. You could have seen the World War 2 from all visions even though from Nazi's eyes in some episodes. But this game, my hands are shaking at the moment. I started downloading Call of Duty WW2 and went to bed then woke up in the middle of the night just to play Singleplayer mode. No food, no break, nothing else; I just kept playing. Me and my squad was having toruble after Zeussman got captured and I felt like I'd lost my own buddy in the army. I was terrified and desperate but what just happened? We found him and the story part was already ended. It is so sad that there is no such great maps like Tunus, Egypt, some more cities in France, Russia etc. The history was like a mobile game's, just ended so fast with a dramatic way. You made me so sad Activision, we do not deserve this as Call of Duty fans...On the other hand, graphics are amazing, especially the cinematics made me feel that I needed to get my helmet and join Pierson's rallies for real. It is such a great thing that Call of Duty series has a new boy which looks perfect. Game play is kinda the same with the series' previous games except the flyboy part. I choosed both options about reverse control feature but the control settings were the same anyway so it was tough for me."

												Although I am only a few hours into the campaign, I have to take a minute to write this review (which I'll update later as I get more hours in).  I really don't understand the negative reviews I've seen posted, especially those claiming to have bad performance or crashes.  I know it can happen but while its easy to blame the game it could also be the user's system.  I haven't had a single issue, crash or performance problem since the very first launch of this game.  I am absolutely impressed by the game's engine, the graphics are astounding and I'm really enjoying the campaign.  I feel like I'm participating in my own ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"".  That being said, I understand the complainst about historical accuracy and all that. However, I am not going to give this game a negative rating because at the end of the day, this is a game.  If I wanted a history lesson I'd watch the History Channel.  What I'm looking for is entertainment, solid game play, kick butt graphics/sound and the feeling I'm getting my money's worth.  CoD: WWII delivers on all of that for me.  Additionally, I also speak German and hate when WWII games have Americans speaking trash German and nothing makes sense.  They did the right thing by hiring native speakers and using real dialogue.  Thank you.  While repetitive, at least its authentic.For those wondering about system performance and all that because of the reviews touting issues, here are my system specs for which I experience ZERO problems:*Windows 7 Professional*MSI Z97 Gaming 7 Motherboard*Intel i7 4790k 4ghz CPU*Corsair Vengeance Pro 16GB 2400MHz RAM*2x Sapphire Radeon R9 290X 4GB GDDR5 TRI-X OC Ver."

												Brilliant Multiplayer action - awesome maps - cool weapons and that indescribably magical COD feel. THIS GAME ROCKS. It also looks peachy and plays like a dream. The HQ 'hub' concept is okay but forgettable; at least it generates loads of 'orders' i.e. challenges that allow you to gain 'loot.' Happy days. What's not so good? Well, the single player stuff is too restrictive, but who cares? Also, there are not enough base skins, so most players look like twins -but there are a lot of cool uniforms to play with. Annoyingly, the designers seem to think the pistol grip deserves hundreds of crappy designs. Why?And you have to carry a weedy pistol around, that you don't even want to use most of the time. That's just stupid. What's best? It's massively addictive - the divisions system allows you to gradually build  five different super soldiers and it just works so well. The explosions really 'go off' too. It's great fun. 90% would be my score."

												I really don't understand all the hate for this game. The campaign is very well done, they removed health regeneration in favour of medkits. Team members are actually useful and provide you with interesting support features. I see a lot of kids ranting about the presence of Soviet guns on the field, which is actually accurate because many soviet weapons were captured and re-distributed among German troops. Pak36(r) for example was a converted version of the 76mm ZiS-3 field gun, SVT-40 were often captured and used since German did not have reliable semi-automatic rifles until 1943 with the introduction of the G-43, and still in few numbers (The G-41 was unreliable and jammed very often)."

												How do I start this... Let's talk about the positive things I see in this game. So far, this has been the best COD game since Black Ops 2. I like the maps, and the addition of custom games and such. I also like that it lets me play with my very poor AMD Radeon 370 card, and I still get a lot of good games. However... THERE'S A LOT OF CHEATERS in this game. It's almost every day, you get to encounter AT LEAST one hacker. The lack of the ability to check other players' combat records and theater make it hard for us players to determine, or at least make better judgement, if another player is cheating or not. It's not like we care about their KDR, but we'd like to know somehow if our suspicion of somone hacking is at least reasonable by looking at their stats. ALSO, there is NO HARDCORE CAPTURE THE FLAG. Like, who does that??? It's more fun than FREE FOR ALL, so why not include it in the HC mode? Anyway, I do not regret buying this game. They just have to do something about the hackers and the KDR."

												From my point of view i think this is a great game. A few negativs would be some elements in the campaign. + Love the health system in the game. It made you rethink your strategies when advancing since you just couldn`t throw yourself into battle and then lay down for a couple of seconds to regain HP. +The way you can utilize your squadmembers to get ammo, health packs, Fire support etc was just great.+Great storyline and characters. For once in along time since the Modern warfare series i actually cared about the squad. I even got a couple of tears in my eyes at a few points when Turner died and so on.+Great graphics+Awesome layout on the missions.- Anti climatic ending. Yes the ending cutscenes where great but i just wanted something more as an ending. Running through a forest and shooting one kraut in slowmode wasn`t alot of an ending for me- I play on a pretty low sensitivity which made these quick time events really hard. I had to manually go from 500 dpi to 2000 dpi to even have a chance. Trying to reach that circle and pressing one button in seconds while having to swipe your mouse 10 times over the mousepad made in literally impossible on low sense. I am not that kind of player that plays on a sensitivity so you can make 5 360s swiping over the pad. -Ammo reserves ingame where pretty bad when it came to assault guns and submachine guns. You run out way to fast.-I have a decent computer(I5-6600k processor, Gtx 1080 graphics card, 16 gb memory cards at 3000mhz speed and so on) Unfortunately i had a lot of FPS drops ingame which led me to changing from 144 hz down to 60 hz to make it somewhat stable. Lag spikes appeared a couple of times but it didn`t affect the gameplay. -6-7 hours to go through the campaign. I just wish it was longer.From my stand point i give this game a 6.5/10. Sure it had some flaws but it is a clear improvement from the future warfare games. It is a refreshment to return to the world war 2 era again where it all started. Thanks for bringing back childhood memories."

												OK - I have just finished the campaign - took about 12 hours moving at a leisurely pace and consisted of 11 missions. I thought it was great - basically a game verison of the HBO Band of Brothers series. Not sure what all the complaining is about. I had no problems with stability - no crashes and had a good framerate all the way through. My latop has 2 680m cards in SLI config which is about 5 year old hardware - no problems. The missions were great - mainly ground combat but also some stealth, tank driving, car driving and flying. I had a blast playing them. Some grumbling out there about the physics of the planes and authenticity of the weapons etc. - come on...its a game not a PHD in history or physics. Just have fun already. Haven't tried multi-player or zombies yet but am looking forward to those modes as well. I would thoroughly recommend the game - good value at full price. Get it - best COD in a while."

												The bad reviews for this for the most petty reasons made me write this review. This game is great if you expect a ww2 version of call of duty. It is a casual fps where you run around and mindlessly kill. It is mainly played for its multiplayer and the amount of the customization including black people and women is perfect for a game like this I love making my character its own. Once again IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A WW2 CALL OF DUTY GAME THAT IS WHAT THIS IS. Love this game and am looking forward to 100's of hours of gameplay."

												Call of Duty WWII brings some new techniques and ideas to the table, and they work. Everyone knows how much MOST COD Storylines are terrible. This one has great character development, and creates an emotional attachment to the characters you  (mostly) work alongside. Some you love, and some you hate which assists with the moral feelings of the Storyline. 11 Singleplayer missions lasting about 20-30 minutes average. Depending on Difficulty of course and speed of the gamer. Probably one of their better stories, and I'm placing the Singleplayer story right next to Modern Warfare ( In my opinion best story ). One thing they brought to the Singleplayer campaign is creating several missions that take you out of the natural COD style and introduce more Stealth, Playing as others characters, Bring air support to the squad, and of course riding a tank. The spread was nice and it was a good pace to change things up. They added these random ""Save Me"" events in the game which is nice. Your chance to be a hero is now. Dragging wounded soldiers to temporary cover, or saving one from being shanked by a German. PROS & CONS (STORY)PROS+ GREAT Linear story+ Great Character Builds + Voice Acting is great+ Weapon choices are nice ( in the sense of what was available at that time )+ Diverse missions (Stealth, sniping, full on charge attacks etc.)+ Adds emotion beyond the war itself (Internal struggles for characters)CONS- Ammo is extremely scarce (Found myself picking up weapons constantly from dead enemies/friendlies)- ""Red"", the main playable character, gets knocked at least 1 time EVERY mission; which got extremely repetitive- Poorly timed ""Save Me"" events (Sometimes randomly found all the way across the battlefield, which ends up being too late to get to/Events happening at the exact same time so you can't do both)- Stealth doesn't have that extra ""UMPH"" (Not being able to close doors behind you, so that's not neccesarily being stealthy)I played a few matches of Multiplayer. Heading straight into Hardcore I was actually pleased with the play style and speed of the online games. They've included an interesting Gamemode that sticks out and that's War. Example is storming the beaches ( typical D-Day scenerio ) but playing it online Allies VS Axis is pretty great. They introduced a ""Social Event"" type area called the HQ. You can basically look at your Mail (Redeemables), Contracts (Earning XP etc.) and much more. Yes I am including the screaming 10 year old with no reason whatsoever (It's still Call of Duty). Interacting with players in an actual playable setting is still an interesting move. PROS & CONS (MULTIPLAYER)PROS+ Weapon Selection is nice + Customization options for Characters are pretty neat+ Weapon customization is easily earned and well worth it+ Maps are decent (Typical you hate some and love some)+ HQ AdditionCONS- Involves no tactics (Typical COD)- Can't use tactics if you WANTED- Not many maps in the cycle (repetitive map play)That leaves the Nazi Zombies gameplay for this game. I originally started at Call of Duty: World at War (First Zombies Introduction) and it was love from there. I initially purchased this game for this reason alone (So I am not disappointed at all). I am used to the ""Wave 1, hold out, rebuild windows, buy a weapon off the wall, wave 5 comes the dogs, buy a door, get a BOX WEAPON, and hold out"". This Zombies gameplay changes things up ( and it's for the best ). Bringing four new characters to the lineup (of course), and well known actors at that. This section actually seems to have a story to it, and I understand BLOPS had a story as well, but this one stretches it even further. You can't rebuild windows, but zombies are coming from EVERYWHERE. There's no ""Holdout"" areas (Except for defending the Lightning Rod objectives). This brings Objectives to the mix. I haven't been able to finish it personally since everyone I have played with are not experienced yet and just give up at wave 20. Being able to CUSTOMIZE your loadout for Zombies is a bold move but it's well balanced. Unlocking them through leveling and mixing and matching the actions. As far as playing the game goes with Characters it's nice they implemented Classes with abilites. Invisibility (Basically), Shooting unlimted bullets for a short period of time, attracting zombies to them while increasing damage, a power aura magically pushing zombies away for a short period. PROS AND CONS (ZOMBIES)PROS+ Four GREAT characters+ Wall Weapon selection is great+ Speed of zombies are perfect+ Difficulty increase of each wave is well balanced+ Cryptic messages and story-driven events add to the gameplay+ Keeps some original thoughts (Light in the sky for box, Jack in the Box or Symbol Monkeys for older versions)+ Perks are excellent and easy to manage+ (Minor) Currency System (Jolts) are interesting+ CAN drop Jolts for your teammates+ Pack-A-Punch can be used early on+ Can buy MOST best weapons off of wall + Can get ammo from either Pack-A-Punch or wall area (IF IT'S UPGRADED)+ Having an ability for each person+ Tesla Weapon CAN BE UPGRADED (Secret though ;) )CONS - Objectives are RIDICULOUS and it gets repetitve if you get far and have to restart- Pack-A-Punch weapons are underpowered- This would absolutely have to be done with a team of four who is communicating and cooperating- Going through hell to build a Tesla Weapon that is not great- Some objectives are unclear (Even though you can ""See"" them in the journal section)Overall I do enjoy this game and see myself getting SEVERAL more hours out of this then what I have. I give it an overall rating of 8/10, and I DO recommend it."

												This was honestly a great game, though the campaign is a bit short and only took me about 5 1/2 hours to complete. Call of Duty: WWII isn't 100% historically accurate but it's a well made game either way. It has a very fun campaign allowing you to play as infantry, tankmen, pilots, and as a German spy. I had no problem at all with lag or crashes like the other reviews say, and I only have a NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 965M Graphics Card running game setting on nearly max. All of these other comments saying ""the guns are so innacurate and I crash every cutscene"" are wrong. They either don't know how to aim or they have a trash computer and I even played on the Veteran difficulty. The only complaint I have about this game is the multiplayer... The multiplay is like any other COD game containing a bunch of immature 12 year olds trash talking you and attempting to trickshot you with a Springfield M1903 Bolt Action Rifle lmfao. Other then that it's a magnificent game overall other than the multiplayer and being historically accurate like we were promised, this really disappoints me the most because this one of the main reasons I was excited for this game's release. Finally a new World War II game made by Sledgehammer! damnit. This is still a excellent game and I recommened you try it for yourself!"

												Brilliant Multiplayer action - awesome maps - cool weapons and that indescribably magical COD feel. THIS GAME ROCKS. It also looks peachy and plays like a dream. The HQ 'hub' concept is okay but forgettable; at least it generates loads of 'orders' i.e. challenges that allow you to gain 'loot.' Happy days. What's not so good? Well, the single player stuff is too restrictive, but who cares? Also, there are not enough base skins, so most players look like twins -but there are a lot of cool uniforms to play with. Annoyingly, the designers seem to think the pistol grip deserves hundreds of crappy designs. Why?And you have to carry a weedy pistol around, that you don't even want to use most of the time. That's just stupid. What's best? It's massively addictive - the divisions system allows you to gradually build  five different super soldiers and it just works so well. The explosions really 'go off' too. It's great fun. 90% would be my score."

												I really don't understand all the hate for this game. The campaign is very well done, they removed health regeneration in favour of medkits. Team members are actually useful and provide you with interesting support features. I see a lot of kids ranting about the presence of Soviet guns on the field, which is actually accurate because many soviet weapons were captured and re-distributed among German troops. Pak36(r) for example was a converted version of the 76mm ZiS-3 field gun, SVT-40 were often captured and used since German did not have reliable semi-automatic rifles until 1943 with the introduction of the G-43, and still in few numbers (The G-41 was unreliable and jammed very often)."

												How do I start this... Let's talk about the positive things I see in this game. So far, this has been the best COD game since Black Ops 2. I like the maps, and the addition of custom games and such. I also like that it lets me play with my very poor AMD Radeon 370 card, and I still get a lot of good games. However... THERE'S A LOT OF CHEATERS in this game. It's almost every day, you get to encounter AT LEAST one hacker. The lack of the ability to check other players' combat records and theater make it hard for us players to determine, or at least make better judgement, if another player is cheating or not. It's not like we care about their KDR, but we'd like to know somehow if our suspicion of somone hacking is at least reasonable by looking at their stats. ALSO, there is NO HARDCORE CAPTURE THE FLAG. Like, who does that??? It's more fun than FREE FOR ALL, so why not include it in the HC mode? Anyway, I do not regret buying this game. They just have to do something about the hackers and the KDR."

												I'm gonna be straight. I like this game, however no game is perfect. Let's dive into the campaign:-----------------------------------TL;DR: It's fun, Pierson is a harda$$, and has little replay value and historically innacurate. 8/10Campaign: It's gritty, fun, historically innacurate. You see the hell that was World War II through the eyes of Private Ronald ""Red"" Daniels. A farmboy from Longview, Texas. The game's campaign uses an old school helath bar much like the earlier CoDs did. However the game doesn't leave you high and dry needing to find helath packs on your own, that's where your squadmate, Zussman comes in. Each squadmate in the campaign has an ability that is used when you kill enough enemies or do ""Heroic actions"" I'll get into those later. Zussman has the ability to toss you health packs. Which you're gonna need. You're only allowed to carry 4 at a time, which is whatever. Through out the ~6-7 hour cmpaign you'll come across ""Heroic Actions"" which are basically just dragging a friendly soldier out of harms way. Which is cool, if the controls weren't so finnicky. You'll get stuck on random debris and other things, just frustrating in my own opinon. Something to notice about the game is that the Germans are using Russian weapons! Through out the game I noticed more Germans running around with PPSH-41s and SVT-40s. Which is odd, because you know, RUSSIA WAS AN ALLY TO AMERICA! Also the SS officers don't have red Nazi armbands. Kinda dumb and is an easy fix. Eh whatever. The game has a few stealth sequences which are fun, but they feel guided, you kinda always know where to go. Let's talk about someone in the story real quick. You know that blonde German from the trailer? He's only in the game for a total of like 4 minutes. He has no screen time and feels like a throw away character. The trailer to me felt like this person would be the main enemy, he isn't, he's just kinda there. The enemy in the game feels like it's one of your own squadmates, Sergeant Pierson. Who to me isn't very likeable. He's honestly just a harda$$.Let's dive into Multiplayer-----------------------------------TL:DR: It's a CoD game. it's like a 6/10Multiplayer is eh. You get a lot of the same play styles and weapons. BAR, STG-44, Grease Gun, Type-100. The multiplayer this year has a new additions this year. Headquarters which is a shameless ripoff of the Tower from Destiny. But it get's the job done, you can hang out there open Supply Drops and have people watch you open them. The tower is dope but it's eh, that's the best I can describe it. Let's talk about the aboslute worse weapons class in the game: Shotguns! They're absolute garbage, even with the buff they just got. They're underpowered. The only thing that makes them usuable is the Expiditionary's ability, which is incidiary shells. Even then if you aren't close enough to your enemy, you're not gonna kill them. They're just bad. It's a good time killer. The supply drop system is the one from MWR, everything id broken into collections, meaning you can buy what you want, even supply drop weapons (which are not out at the time of writing this). The supply drops have a new tier this year, which is called ""Heroic"" and it's better than Epic. Each gun in the game has a hidden epic and heroic variant, which are all cosmetic. Epics are all rusty and worn while Heroics are all clean and shiny like they're just off the factory line!Zombies-----------------------------------TL;DR: It's alright. 5/10This is Sledgehammer's second shot at zombies, and I think they did pretty well. I haven't poured alot of hours into it, but the zombies imo, are scary this year. The game gets you with cheap jumpscares with a sharp music spike and your character freaking out. In order to play the real zombies map ""The Final Reich"", the game makes you play a tutorial for this years zombies which are kinda different this year. Honestly, you just need to play it to form an opinion yourself."

												I dont know why everybody is crying about the game ? The campaign is fantastic and yes the cutscenes are capped at 30 FPS, but thats because they are loading the map without a loading screen. Graphics are amazing en the gameplay is quiet challenging if you put it at hard. Different uses of gameplay, like driving a car, driving a tank, flying a plane... Multiplayer hitboxes are still some buggy but thats COD in general. Zombies is pretty good but ez to play, follow the easter egg, complete it and you have nothing else to do. Still, the graphics are amazing and the new bosses are awesome.WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE GAME!!"

												Singleplayer Review: The Most Visceral WW2 Shooter YetI'll get this out of the way. If you aren't the hypercritical type who just wants a competent shooter to play for a few hours, this will do just fine and may even impress.The sound design is lacking bass and the guns don't have a good distinction. Also, while the visuals present a chaotic war being fought, the ambient sound of battles unfortunately doesn’t capture that same grit.The story is very focused on the protagonist with very few characters. There is a serious lack of a bigger picture in the way of feeling like you are part of a platoon rather than a squad.Sledgehammer tried some new types of levels with different gameplay to break up the soldier bits. These show up for a level then never get revisited (which is a good thing). They just aren’t typical for COD and I loved seeing something different.Some of the levels are the best depictions of the battles I've seen yet in that they are extremely cinematic in feel while being very tense.

												TL:DR - Overall good game, reasonable at $60 usd, or about 1000 aud...Campaign -Although the Campaign doesnt offer much time wise, completed it within a couple hours. It is best described as short but sweet. The opening scene landing on the beaches of Normandy to watching someone get blown to pieces in a bell tower is quite possible the best features in the game, in combination with the amazing graphics really does show how far games how come and make this such an awesome campaign.Zombies -I havent really played the zombies yet, although from the 20 mins I played it seems like a cool idea but at this point I feel like theyre just trying to milk the idea. I mean cmon its nearly been a decade, and nearly 5 CoD games with this mode? feel like there needs to be a change, survival mode in MW3 was a good addition, I didnt mind the extinction mode in ghosts. But now I feel there needs to be something new!Multiplayer -Im currently about to hit Prestige 2 so I feel like ive had a resonable of experience with the multiplayer... and well, its what youd expect in a Call of Duty game. Everyone just abuses the most powerful weapons, ie the STG and the PPSH (In my opinion) which kinda limits your play style.The Division system adds a nice touch to the gamestyle as rather then perks you have to level up your ""skill"" to be able to have these additions. Although I think the fire rounds for the shotguns, although you only get 4 may need a little tweaking. Say you get a full clip, although its earned as a kill streak for that class.The Rifles and SMGs still dominate this game which is nothing short of surprising each have their own pros and cons except for those mentioned before. The LMGs are quite powerful but glad to see the long reload compensates for that, The Sniping is satisfying although somewhat unbelieveable as most of the time the bullet seems to go in the complete other direction as to where you are standing??? also, anyone else notice a lot more collats happening?? And lastly, The shotguns. Theyre all round ok at cqc but other than that good luck, the Double barrel and sawed off arent worth your time, Brecci v2 is disgusting on hardcore and the trench gun, well id like to see a few more limbs ;)All round solid game but dont expect anything revolutionary about it.Would recommend based on the fact that its WWII :) Also where are the playable tanks hm?"

												This review is on both campaign and multiplayer.I have never bought a COD game in my life but have played a few COD games at friends houses, but until now i have decided to give the new COD ago as i was interested of the game going back to its roots. I will start off my thoughts for the campaign.The campaign was decently good as it showed what WW2 was like, some of the campaign wasnt historically accurate but i believe the whole purpose of this game was ment to be fun. You play as a soldier named Daniels who volunteers to fight for his country and rid the Nazis from Europe. As you progress through the campaign Daniels begins to see that war was never a easy task, as the war has always been nightmare. I did like the campaign as there was some good and rare funny moments, but the campaign did have some problems. The campaign was short as it is only a 6 hour campaign. Some of the missions had stealth involved which was a bit boring honestly. And some of the missions just went too quick. Overall the campaign was decently good so i give it a 7/10.To the multiplayer. The multiplayer is pretty fun as it now contains a new mode called War. It also has a thing called headquarters where you gather with other players either have a 1v1 with them, or show off your loot crates that you have collected. The leveling up system is pretty straight forward and you will occasionally get some goodies. Customizing your character, weapons and etc is pretty straight forward as well. And the hardcore modes are just fun. And its not paid to win. Overall multiplayer is decent as well and enjoyable to play most of the time. 7/10Overall i do enjoy this game alot, the game is very well optimized and its great to play a WW2 game. And i am glad that Activision has heard from their community that they need to go back to their roots. Good game Activision."

												I have mixed feeling about this game - I'm recommending it because it is usually fun, but it does have some flaws.The campaign is better than some of the past COD efforts and is enjoyable on the whole.  The multiplayer is where I spend most of my time and can be extremely exciting and fun.  However, I can't escape the feeling that some players are cheating, especially when seeing match results featuring kill to death ratios of 27:1 in places.  I get it that some experienced folks can shoot me faster than I can get them, but I have run into cases of being shot through barriers before I even get around a corner to lay eyes on my opponent.It would be better if there was an option to engare in matches with players of similar rank as myself.  Presently, everyone is in one big pot and people who are starting out have to compete against others who have prestiged multiple times.  I also wish it were possible to change Headquarter lobbies - I had one the other night where someone was preaching religion loudly and with great enthusiasm, so I had to log off.The custom game mode is great!  I can play what I want with friends and fill in the blanks with bots - who are pretty good at the game, but not impossible .  This is a great feature, and swung my vote to ""Like"".Right now, I try to avoid the obvious bad guys and usually can find a match that is acceptable and fun."

												This game gives you a run for your money, because it really makes you want to run for your money!0/10 No Eminem sound track, no snoop dogg annuncer. All joking aside. I spend since 12:40 to 1:15 trying to get a gamemode to work(I.E Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies) The Campaign decieded to work first and it is the most scripted hand holding not immersive at all. The lags that happen are incrediably annoying and find my self restarting the mission 24/7 having the game run better and better every time. The game looks great dont get me wrong! But it's so corny and transparent. It is a World War II trope checkless. This game is no step in the right direction. There is new mechaniques in the game but does not balance for the poop port and terrible story. To much hand holding. Get 'Cloud Bashers' instead(on iOS, or Android) ps. my pc is not bad my profile has my build on itedit: Their plan was to make you go through loading and crash therefore you can't return and keep your money. (Online servers down but on console it's fine I heard)another edit: it's 3am and still nothing works. The campaign is still bad. A billion dollar company produces such a half a** game makes the industry seem on a down stem. Story games are dying.another another edit : multiplayer not laggy but does not make up for it"

												Other then most of the recent negative recensions based on nothing found around this game, have I played this game that long to make a fair and rational recension due to EXPERIENCE instead of repeating the mainstream cliche critics (and I mean those ♥♥♥♥♥ing with only 0.2 hours played)..I'll start with the campaign: I've noticed that there are some influences taken from mostly Medal of Honor Allied Assault, then again so was the very first Call of Duty series at the 'warchest' franchise. This because of the fact that some of the designers at the MoH AA series have also co-produced some scenes/animation at the very first CoD series. So that's quite explainable in a rational NEUTRAL point of view. But then you have one mission (with the plane, at the Battle of the Bulge campaign) which is (almost) EXACTLY similiar to Battlefield 1 by protecting your allied bombers from the German 'luftwaffe'. I honestly don't know who was first (note that the annunciation of CoD WW2 was earlier than BF1), but said in general view: by copying your 'competor' for the sake of your own campaign's gameplay is something which should be avoided as you won't compete convincable. Can't really say it's just inconvenient coincidence... Then you have this 'bayonet charge' which is also similiar to that of BF1 (with the same 'fish eye' effects and screaming underwhile charging), but seen in a historic and pre-DICE aspect you need to understand that they've introduced this way before in the World at War game (then again that was only the stab of the bayonet attached to the weapon, charging wasn't possible before). The cinematic effects and cutscenes are well performed, but I must add that some cutscenes are just quite unnecessary such as the landing on Omaha beach at the D-Day assault. I understand that they need to add that extra touch of cinematic gameplay, but overdoing that will end up in an annoying cliche (same with diving to your foxholes at the Battle of the Bulge campaign where you just really weren't sure if the cutscene ended or not). The storyline makes the player into the ingame characters, which automatically means the A to Z storyline is brought over to the 'audience' but with keeping the 'historic accurate' campaign in mind (with a lose eye on that though, as some uniforms and weapon choices for certain battles aren't really thought out in a historic aspect). Kinda reminded me of the Band of Brothers storyline, with Pierson as Ronald Speirs. There are some annoying bugs which I'm not certain of if it's just me or the pre-update release.. The sound is being disturbed sometimes, making it sound like the voices are on a vibrator. Kinda ruins the cinematic gameplay experience, as sound is an important thing you need to add for the full experience (try to watch a movie with the sound muted..)! Also a quite annoying thing were the A.I controlled teammates. Now don't get me wrong, I do like it how they brought that realistic experience with regrouping on your teammates and performing the mission together, instead of the cliche one-man Rambo army executing a whole enemy squadron and coincidentally surviving every grenade blast, bullet and explosion.. But the player's character is a bit faster than the other members, which makes the solid running animation compared with the others quite cartoonish (also the synchronized running off stairs animation of your fellow team mates is hilarious!).. Also the picking up a live grenade to throw it back is quite stupid to do in a real battlefield, but that has always a Call of Duty thing for as far as I know (plus, with the stick grenades it isn't realistic as stick grenades explode on impact instead of the timer fuse. Also a big thing I dislike is the 'calling out enemies' by Pierson thingy, which lights up the enemies even in smoke and behind shelter. That reminds me too much of that allowed wallhack in the Medal of Honor Warfighter even in multiplayer, something you should be strict about to prevent that (you don't want folks to know how to use hacks). Now my opinion regarding multiplayer:I like how they finally made your playable character customizable with the different faces, adds some 'diversity' on the battlefield (yeah, they added women. So what? It wasn't such a big deal in the Medal of Honor Allied Assault series with Manon! And some seemed to never heard about the Soviet female sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko)! Also the custom classes to actual divisions with different skins is a great converted change, but the camo skins and adjustable red dot sights is a bit unnessecary in my opinion as you'll add too much of a futuristic look to that (like in Black Ops 2, or Advanced Warfare which was the purpose of making it sci-fi like) something to be avoided in an era revolving around the 20th century (everything pre-Cold War at least). Now one thing I'm still not satisfied with is how Activision isn't that strict upon hackers. There isn't really an anti-cheat system INGAME (so not spoken about Valve, the basic Steam anti-cheaters policy). You need your community to be clean at all times, because I rather have their time invested in THAT instead of the upcoming season pass DLCs! You can bring DLCs on the market, but when the majority of your community is hacking you won't encourage fair players to buy that DLC too. Then you have the new 'War' mode I like, but which is basically nothing more but Capture the Flag, Search and Destroy and Domination in one.. I would like to see actual operations revolving around teamplay with everyone having a function, maybe based on the division you're playing as. Now it's more a basic arcade match with every man fighting for his own, that's how it feels at least. But thinking outside the box, maybe instead of the usual 'one man has a more important function than the others' (such as the bomb carrier in S&D), everyone has an equal function on the battlefield. It is also 'noob friendly' for new players to get into the game fast, once you know how everything's done (especially the new headquarters and challenges mode). However, major bugs are pleadging the gameplay experience. The sound bug as mentioned before is also active in MP. Then you have the connection problem, with laggy servers and losing connection half of the time which ruins the FPS framerate (PC specs has nothing to do with that, as a matter of fact I've installed the latest GeForce Game Ready Driver which is revolving around the CoD WWII!) In a general view, I'm not that positive regarding my expectations and actual practive around the game, but most certainly also not that negative because what everyone seems to forget in their crtitics, is that Battlefield 1 is an open map gameplay and Call of Duty has always been an 'arcade' mode. So Call of Duty wise, the game is close to perfection for the CoD series (then again I still prefer WaW over CoD WWII as it has a bit of a more realistic vibe to it regarding historical facts). Then again, most of the community is already glad that they got rid of the jetpacks and remastered the prefered 'zombie' mode! I am following the upcoming innovations where they hopefully will fix major bugs and make the gameplay a bit more bearable for all."

I am finally excited about call of duty again. P.S. stay away from futuristic games, leave that to the likes of Destiny & Halo... not another Infinite Warfare."

												First of all .. Hi everyone,To be honest after 10 years I am so happy to play CoD. Game is rly so nice & enjoyable .. Sledgehammer did excelent job so “hoah !” Game is for me balanced cause it´s just about skill and weapon using. I am personaly so happy and how others writing about hackers .. I just met Two damn true hackers and I have now about 140h played. How I found most people are just crying and Marking Good players as hackers. So then they are flamimg here and making bad reviews cause they’re just “dying a lot”. huh..So I fully recommend this game & See you in game !"

 Campaign Pros•Not being able to recover health without medkits provides a more challenging experience than run and hide until you get your health back•The cinematics and overall narrative telling are really good, similar to advanced warfare. It really helps you get to know / care about the characters more.•The collectibles in the campaign give me something nice to find when I go screw around trying to look for random little easter eggsCons•Why do germans have a ppsh?•Unskippable intro cutscenes, you better look at all the achievements so you can do them the first run through!•Throwing smoke grenades doesn't stop you from being aimbotted on by NPCs sometimes Zombies Pros• I wasn't very keen on the class system at first, but really they're really similar to the cards and gobblegum from previous installments. Although some of them are FAR superior to the others (camoflague)• Making juggernog into an armor system that becomes increasingly more expensive the more you take damage provides an interesting gameplay element, as well as allows you to free up a perkslot seeing as juggernog is always a 100% meta perk. (Although I would like to see them add some completely new perks)• Appears to be a lot of unlockables for what appear to be secrets, more easter egg fun!Cons• Some of the characters feel very uninsteresting or sometimes the voice acting seems a little phoned in.• I dislike the ""Quest Guide"" that the game gives you, although it's more acceptable because there's a ""casual"" easter egg and a ""hardcore"" easter egg, which gives rewards. The quest guide only gives you hints on how to do the casual part.• There's no way to view which of the secret challenges you've unlocked, this would help so much for not accidentally doing the same thing twice! (Literally the most painful problem) Multiplayer Pros• Most guns feel very usable, I haven't seen any guns so far that are objectively ""the best""• As of now, there's no P2W in the lootboxes, all weapon variants just make the gun look fancier and give xp boosts• It's really refreshing to go back to the old ""boots on the ground"" style of combatCons• The social hub is a kind of gathering place you can go to between games, mostly just a cool place to open your lootboxes where everybody can see them• Sometimes it feels like you're shooting marshmallows at people with some of the SMGs, at least they have a high rate of fire!"

												The game comes down to cheaters.People who excessively use aimbots / wallhacks. and when you goto report people you get booted offline it crashes your game most time.Quickscoping is 100% accurate you can run around instant killing anyone which is kinda overpowered in my opinion...lack of interesting game modes or competitive spawns in stanadard war is the only viable game mode.hardcore is impossible because it's impossible to tell if someone is cheating.A lot of things are unable to be used in the game spite it being a triple a game."

												People talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about this franchise. So heres an honest review.The game has some problems. it's quite glitchy and there seem to be some balancing issues that they need to sort out.The campaign is pretty good to me. The story has character, moreso than other games in this series. If you can get past some slight over the top action and some slight historical innacuricies (I know I buthcered that word) than you will probably at least have the campaign keep your attention until its over for one playthrough. The multiplayer, the reason everyone plays the gameIt's....not bad. The guns feel great and the KB/M really helps it be skill over TTK. Now, some of the modes are more populated then others. TDM and DOM are gonna have you getting in matches faster than other modes like CTF and gridiron. The hardcore playlist is a little annoying to me as there is close to no punishment for TKing you teammates constantly. You don't get kicked yet and that needs to be fixed. The multiplayer is fun beside some balancing issues and some maps catering to very specific playstyles leaving some people in the dust beacause they can't or won't adapt.  If you like a mindless multiplayer where you can have fun with friends or just chill with music and a beer. You're going to like the MP. At least when your not that salty over the game kinda fighing back unless you do what it wants. Zombies is not bad. It's a little more Objective focused that I would've hoped but it's still fun. I miss classic zombies and black ops zombies. It's getting a tad complicated now but if you have a full party it can be fun. Overall, the game is fun. It's COD. It has some problems like all games do at launch but as they get fixed and the game becomes more stable I hope that the community here stays. What we have is a good base, it just needs to be built on and stabilized for it to really get into it's stride and become something special.~huskyScore-7/10"

												Even better than I expected! Excellent CoD! New feeling, but gunplay is like CoD4/MW series! Very excellent CoD! Spawn system is reworked, maps really feel 2 sided now. No more spawning in the center (except in free for all), and you can flip them, but each team starts on a given side - it is really a much more tactical experience when you understand this.Headquarters is so cool, so many weapon variants and uniforms to unlock - something for everyone.I hated every cod since MW2.

												Dont believe the first couple of reviews addressing hackers, i bought this game a couple weeks ago and i was expecting to refund it right away reading about how theres gonna be tons of hackers. Played it, was sketchy at first but the player was just really good, i've encountered 1 hacker in the almost 47+ plus of playing, zombies is great, a little plain atm unlocking secret characters is fun and adds a great challenge. Multiplayer is also great, the contracts and orders adds something to do, as well as all the fun little eastereggs in headquarters, Haven't played campaign but i heard its co-op and its really great, gonna play that with a couple of friends soon. Don't believe everything you see, this game is great so far id give it a 4/5 stars, only problem i have with the game is i keep getting stutters in multiplayer (i have a 1070) tried lowering all settings and still get fps stutters, my friend says he doesn't get any so its probably client side but everything is great except the stutters so far.(it says i only have 0.1 hours because i play the multiplayer not campaign)"

												I expected combat with a little more nuance, but this is just a modern, fast-paced FPS with a WWII skin slapped on it. Also, the game is horifically optimized. I have a high end gaming PC but this game is filled with technical issues. When I load into a match, it takes 1-2 minutes to even begin playing because the game takes so long to load assets. It forces me to spectate while every player holds invisible weapons and map textures look like a PS2 game. On top of that, seemingly at random the game decides to begin freezing for 0.5 seconds at a time, every few seconds. This makes combat completely unplayable. I purchased this for myself as a birthday gift and it's ultimately one of the biggest wastes of money I've ever spent, reminding me why the $60 price tag on new AAA games is such a terrible risk to take."

												After 30+ hours, I am giving this up as a waste of money.In 1/3 of my games I see people using aimbots, wall hacks or visual hacks that show where every player is located. Couple the cheaters with the game frequently pitting a bunch of new players against a group of prestige players means there is little enjoyment to be had except being a victim. Out of the dozens of matches I have played, I have had ~5 that were evenly matched and without people using exploits.Spawn > run a little forward > get headshot. Rinse. Repeat until the match ends.War is an interesting game mode and well executed. I just wish they could stop the hacking."

												Its been about 10 years since i paid the cod series any interest and i think this game is great, unfortunately these days devs will never impress everyone, people demand too much and its just going to be impossible to impress everyone, especially in a AAA title where the whole world is watchingi havent played the single player yet so on that i cant comment, however i have put roughly 70 hours into mpFar as im concerned this game is pretty damn good minus the hackers, theres definately the occasional hacker out there, and they are blatant, they make no attempt to hide the fact, every single one i come across i report through the ingame social tab and also through steam but some i reported 2 weeks ago i still find today cheating under the same name so hopefully they will bring out some kind of anti cheat in the near future or this game will be ruinedAs far as servers go and lag, i dont know what people are complaining about. 9 times outta 10 if i choose one of the more popular game modes ( TDM, DOM , WAR) the game will put me into the best lobby it can find.It is unfortunate that you cant view a server list and pick a game that you want to join, but in reality if you end up in  a game with yellow or red bars its only because theres nothing locally and having a server list isnt really going to change that.The only thing i would change here is having a setting where you can change the amount of time before it expands to other countries to find a game. i would rather spend 5 minutes waiting for a local lobby to fill up then wait 10 seconds before it expands across the globe and puts me into a red bar game. Ofcourse it makes sense why they've done this because lots of people today lack any sort of patience.Some people are complaining about frame drops and poor graphics ... to that i can totlally disagree, the game looks beautiful and runs buttery smooth, never dips below 120 fps, and 1080p max settings, sure i have a fairly new set up so people with lower end systems should take this with a grain of saltloot crates are fine i have no complaints here, you can pay for em or earn them through playing and all they contain are cosmetics with the occasional weapon skin that will grant bonus xp, nothing here to give anyone an advantageat the end of the day i can only speak for myself when i say this game was worth the purchase, its typical cod, fast paced, small maps, full of quickscopers and sprinkled with hackers, be prepared to see the terms ""ez"" and ""sweaty"" used alotBuy it, try it, if you dont like it, refund it, easy!"

												In my opinions this is my third worst CoD game. Maps are dreadful. The company clearly does not have the mental capacity to nerf weapons (PPSh, STG and Bar), yes the bar did get nerfed but by a miniscule amount. I personally do not use those guns because im not a scumbag and using other weapons is pointless because you are killed before you BB bullets are shot. If you're one of those people who say ""You're just bad at the game"" you're the most ignorant person I have ever encountered."

												I would advise interested purchasers to take a lot of reviews for this game with a grain of salt. The game runs solid and looks amazing. The campaign is fun, engaging, and the multiplayer servers don't have any problems at all despite what people are saying. I find it funny that a lot of the negative reviews are people that have less than 0.2 hours logged in the game. That's not enough time to even adequately review a game properly. I would play the game before listening to a lot of this bandwagon negative feedback and make your own decision about its content. I haven’t played a CoD on PC in a long time and this is a perfect time to get back into the CoD franchise on PC. The game is fun, the multiplayer action is visceral, and the war mode is a welcomed feature to help reinstate the franchise as a FPS contender. (Thank god there isn’t any wall runs!)"

												Ok so lets address some of these ""negative"" reviews. Yes the game is historically inaacurate for some parts of  the singleplayer oh well. But the story was  worth while so it diddnt bother me, but people are saying the game runs like garbage, and for me personally this is not true. I am on the most updated GPY drivers for my gtx 970, and running maxed out at 60fps locked no problems. I also havent really had any server issues with the game so im not sure if thats just me being lucky or what but so far so good. As for the gameplay I think it is very fun and back to the root of call of duty like what people wanted. The mutiplayer is fast paced and relentless. The divisions are all unique there is already alot to be unlocked, the whole headquarters idea also seems very cool.  The game obviously can have some work to it to make it better, but in my oppinion the best COD since MW2! People are also saying the game is ""dead"" already but I have no problem logging on and jumping right into a game with my squad. Bottom line, if you like the basic root of Cods, and can get past the fact the game isint PERFECT and that it needs some time for some updates then you will love this game. New game modes, new guns, and a whole new gamplay style is refreshing and it feels like what everyone has been asking for for so long has finally been answerd."

Definitely a breath of fresh air, the on-disk map feels smaller in scope but thats where the real charm is. having just about everything laid out in front of you with little investment needed to set up is such a huge relief, not to mention the 2 seperate main quests. havent bothered to try online because that never goes well but well worth the buy (maybe even the season pass) for zombies alone this time."

												I haven't liked a COD title since Modern Warfare 2 but I am quite happy with this one so far. The multiplayer is fast paced and fun, doesn't have all the ridiculous killstreaks or jetpacks. Is it a realistic multiplayer shooter? No, that's what Heroes and Generals is for. Zombies is zombies as per usual with some minor tweaks, but is still fun.Campaign starts with Normandy and if you ignore some of the dumb inaccuracies it's quite the experience. My only major gripe with campaign is the inability to turn off music, which in 2017 just seems like such a lazy move from the developers. The soundtrack is really jarring and they need to patch in an option to shut it off. Overall I am happy with the purchase but really don't understand how devs can make such silly mistakes that we see in this title."

												I was expecting A LOT MORE from the campaign I managed to go thru it in 8 hrs and the story is not half bad! The only 2 famous battles from the era of  second World War that they put in the game are D Day and The last bridge of the river Rhine. There is 1 mission where you can fly a plane, 3 missions where you drive a car, and 1 mission where you fight with tanks. All together 11 MISSIONS, kinda 50:50, you can play stealth in a couple of them. They put a health system into the game where the health doesn't recharge all on its own, you have to use medipacks if you find them or you can ask your buddy to give you one, same for the ammo and granades, even mortair fire. Kind of a cool system if you ask me. All in all I would recommend this game, it has style, NOT AT ALL a copy of previous COD games, although it could have been SO MUCH BETTER! The game didn't crash a single time, there were some problems with audio being a little bit skreetchy, but I was running Premiere Pro which is CPU intensive so maybe thats why. The plot is nicely written and the overall story is emotional and kinda keeps you going. My final rating of this game is 6 out of 10, and I do reccomend this game."

												This is the first CoD I've enjoyed in a REALLY long time. Oddly enough I didn't even know it was coming until like a month ago I tried to fire up CoD 2 because I was jonesing for a decent single player ww2 campaign FPS to just screw around with for a while. When I had trouble getting that to work with my ultrawide monitor and was looking around for help there, I started seeing links for this release. Having spent money in the past for CoD releases on sale hoping to find something I could get into and being disappointed with everything I tried after WaW, I was pretty sure I was about to blow $60 again on something that would forever have 20 minutes played next to it in my library. Well I'm quite happy to have been wrong there. This has been a great game so far. I've really enjoyed the couple of nights I've spent with it. The cutscenes are awesome, the story is just meaty enough to be there without pretending there needs to be more than an interlude between battles. It's been just challenging enough for my gameplay style at normal to make me already look forward to the next play through at a higher difficulty. As much as I wish I could be an uber gamer god with a PC powered by a quantum singularity and a huge Gsync monitor thats just not an option. I'm kind of middle of the road hardware-wise, GTX 1070, LG 60hz ultrawide, etc. and while it's not smooth sailing with all the things turned to 11, using the ""optimize settings"" button got me a pretty gorgeous experience without any video stuttering or choppy play. There is a weird audio stutter that comes up durring cutscenes sometimes thats annoying but I've not been bothered by it enough yet to look for a fix. Otherwise my only real gripe is with the lack of direction/tutorial for things like,  A) How to handle the hand to hand combat instances where you have to tap F quickly then move your mouse to a circle and tap something else quickly or lose the fight, although after some trial and error I figured these out.B) Driving certain vehicles, specifically tanks. That one kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off for about 15 minutes until I Forest Gumped my way through it. Overall, if you're on the fence about picking it up because you think you're gonna be let down like you were with the last handfull of CoD titles, my advice is to go for it. I think you'll be happy. I read a good number of negative reviews that seem to be REALLY nit picky about some pretty unimportant♥♥♥♥♥♥ People complain about historical accuracy and realism, the lack of brutality, which I think is absurd when you consider that you can get shot numerous times and wrap some gauze around you and be right as rain. I wonder if those people avoid the Captain America movies because the Nazis had lasers and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also, I've not read or seen any accounts of actual zombies durring WWII but I'm sure as hell excited about killing undead Nazis."

												Another game in the Call of Duty series, a series that is returning to it's roots, meaning the game should be good, right? right...? Well not exactly. This game was a good idea, however it has done so poorly, and Activision has once again shown how greedy of a company they are.CampaignCampaign is ok, and has some interesting story moments... What, were you expecting me to go in depth? I'm not, because the story sure as hell didn't when it came to character development.MultiplayerThe multiplayer is decent at bestWith sledgehammer being the developer, there are of course a few select weapons that are very much overpowered if you know how to move your mouse, and then the weak ones that are so worthless that pumping 5 shots into someone still won't kill them before they unload their stg into your face. Maps can't decide whether they want to be stonehaven from Ghosts or Nuketown.Matchmaking is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's easy to find a game, but maintaining a stable connection to it is a whole 'nother story. It is nearly impossible to go 4 games without losing connection or even having major connection issues.Unlocking preorders is broken for so many people. It has been 3 days, and there is no fix for it, even with all the people complaining on the forums and begging for it.Personal note: Sledgehammer already announced supply drop weapons and dlc one, plus they paywalled Carentan...? Jesus H Christ, when will Activision stop being a buch of money ♥♥♥♥♥s, and have Sledgehammer fix their game. Shows their priorities, making extra cash instead of fixing the issues that drive people away.zombiesThis is actually the one reason why I recommend this game. Zombies, something that has been in the last 2 games (excluding MWR of course), and returning in a not so good, broken, and slightly overhyped game. This is the redeemer of this game.WW2 zombies is a great recreation of the classic Treyarch zombies we know and love (no IW zombies, we know you exist, but you are not Treyarch zombies. back into the corner), but instead of the copy and paste formula in a different time period, or simply changing the location, WW2 zombies creates its own unique narrative, and adds variety. (IW zombies, get back into that corner! You used the stupid ""helpless heroes trapped in a movie"" and inception bs!)Storywise, WW2 zombies spins a gruesome but enjoyable tale. Marie Fischer gathers 3 operatives to assist her in rescuing her brother Klaus from a group of Nazis that are performing experiments with Barbarossa's sword. On the way Mittelburg, the train carrying them is destroyed by a shadow hidden beast, and they all run to the deserted (for the moment) town. They enter the (not so) hidden bunker, and proceed to activate the devices that provide energy to Barbarossa's sword, which is also powering the zombies. After dislodging the sword, they fight the behemoth that attacked them earlier, the panzermorder, which Klaus has been fused with and is unwillingly a part of. The panzermorder is used to destroy a Nazi airship that is shooting at the group, and is also destroyed along with it. Depending on which easter egg the player did, Klaus can be dead, or if the hardcore easter egg is complete, a crystal will resurrect Klaus from the dead, and he will be surrounded in a strange aura. Much more complex treyarch zombies when it comes to telling a story in a single map.Gameplay wise, WW2 zombies is like Treyarch zombies, but it has far more interesting zombie variants, like.... ugh, Exo zombies. God, i wish i didn't have to bring that up. Still, Sledgehammer created a diverse all star cast of zombies, ranging from skeletons that are barely clinging on to little bits of flesh and muscle that lets them move, to giant behemoths wearing flamethrowers. each variant of a zombie brings some new twist that will make the player have to think and prioritize targets.OverallI do recommend this game. Not for the multiplayer or campaign, only for zombies. The campaign is lackluster at best, and the multiplayer is plain disappointing.

												The game has some minor bugs and glitches, but in the end i didnt have any major problem.I have a solid 80 fps, both in campaign and multiplayer, so far i had a great time in multiplayer, no toxicity.The levels from the campaign are awesome, they are very realistic and every detail from the war can be found there.In my opinion this is a great game, even if it is 60 euros."

Multiplayer is incredibly fun, probably the most enjoyable experience I've ever had in COD Multiplayer since MW2... and the campaign is amazing, detailed, gritty, and all around great.  Has a pretty large playerbase that continues to go up and runs really well.  Haven't tried the zombies yet but have heard it's actually really fun as well too. All around fantastic game!

												Ok so lets address some of these ""negative"" reviews. Yes the game is historically inaacurate for some parts of  the singleplayer oh well. But the story was  worth while so it diddnt bother me, but people are saying the game runs like garbage, and for me personally this is not true. I am on the most updated GPY drivers for my gtx 970, and running maxed out at 60fps locked no problems. I also havent really had any server issues with the game so im not sure if thats just me being lucky or what but so far so good. As for the gameplay I think it is very fun and back to the root of call of duty like what people wanted. The mutiplayer is fast paced and relentless. The divisions are all unique there is already alot to be unlocked, the whole headquarters idea also seems very cool.  The game obviously can have some work to it to make it better, but in my oppinion the best COD since MW2! People are also saying the game is ""dead"" already but I have no problem logging on and jumping right into a game with my squad. Bottom line, if you like the basic root of Cods, and can get past the fact the game isint PERFECT and that it needs some time for some updates then you will love this game. New game modes, new guns, and a whole new gamplay style is refreshing and it feels like what everyone has been asking for for so long has finally been answerd."

												I haven't liked a COD title since Modern Warfare 2 but I am quite happy with this one so far. The multiplayer is fast paced and fun, doesn't have all the ridiculous killstreaks or jetpacks. Is it a realistic multiplayer shooter? No, that's what Heroes and Generals is for. Zombies is zombies as per usual with some minor tweaks, but is still fun.Campaign starts with Normandy and if you ignore some of the dumb inaccuracies it's quite the experience. My only major gripe with campaign is the inability to turn off music, which in 2017 just seems like such a lazy move from the developers. The soundtrack is really jarring and they need to patch in an option to shut it off. Overall I am happy with the purchase but really don't understand how devs can make such silly mistakes that we see in this title."

												I was expecting A LOT MORE from the campaign I managed to go thru it in 8 hrs and the story is not half bad! The only 2 famous battles from the era of  second World War that they put in the game are D Day and The last bridge of the river Rhine. There is 1 mission where you can fly a plane, 3 missions where you drive a car, and 1 mission where you fight with tanks. All together 11 MISSIONS, kinda 50:50, you can play stealth in a couple of them. They put a health system into the game where the health doesn't recharge all on its own, you have to use medipacks if you find them or you can ask your buddy to give you one, same for the ammo and granades, even mortair fire. Kind of a cool system if you ask me. All in all I would recommend this game, it has style, NOT AT ALL a copy of previous COD games, although it could have been SO MUCH BETTER! The game didn't crash a single time, there were some problems with audio being a little bit skreetchy, but I was running Premiere Pro which is CPU intensive so maybe thats why. The plot is nicely written and the overall story is emotional and kinda keeps you going. My final rating of this game is 6 out of 10, and I do reccomend this game."

Of course, it's got the standard ""superhero"" feel to it where you don't die as a freaking B2 bomber is descending on your squad and somehow you manage to survive virtually unscathed. The multiplayer, on the other hand, needs some work. The netcode is pretty trashed right now, and some guns are wayyyyy OP for the setting that they're in. I'm also not a big fan of the addition of supply drops as a reward. It's better than buying them, but it's still unfair to worse players. That's just me"

And to the people complaining that there are no swastikas that is due to the fact that it is against the international law to do anything related to nazis and if you buy the international versio of the game obviously there wont be any traces of nazis due to the fact that the game wouldn't be able to sell in germany and other countries. Overall i'd give the game 8/10 due to the fact that its good but there could be some tweaking with the cut scenes and the only glitches i've found were funny so im not complaining."

												This game is great the story jumps a bit but thats because the 1st didn't fight every battle in europe the multiplayer to me runs fine it just requires a bit of skill and the game is historically accurate even when people complain about the germans have ppsh-41's and m3 submachine guns this is because most of the men were getting them from battles against the russians and from italy when america invaded italy. And to the people complaining that there are no swastikas that is due to the fact that it is against the international law to do anything related to nazis and if you buy the international versio of the game obviously there wont be any traces of nazis due to the fact that the game wouldn't be able to sell in germany and other countries. Overall i'd give the game 8/10 due to the fact that its good but there could be some tweaking with the cut scenes and the only glitches i've found were funny so im not complaining."

												This game is amazing regarding the quality of graphics, detailed maps, story line, imerssiveness, and multiplayer balancing. The graphics are incredibly customizable, which is a must for someone like me who derives as much satisfaction from tinkering with graphics settings as I do actually playing the game. It looks beautiful - to the point where you can hide in a crater waiting to ambush someone, and you'll notice the detailed textures, reflections, and bump-mapping of the mud and dirt. The sounds enhance the experience with grit and pebbles flying around you from grenade explosions. They can be used to locate enemies during multiplayer sessions, sometimes too easily in my humble opinion, but in no way does that detract from the gameplay. The environment sounds also contribute to the immersive experience with radio chatter, AA guns, automotive sounds, etc... Overall the audio compliments the visual quite nicely.The weapons feel quite authentic. From their gritty textures to the detailed (and believable) camouflage patterns! There are many to choose from, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. In the single player it's fun to use the M1 Garand, and in the multiplayer it can be used too! While the single player campaign doesn't allow for customization of weapons, the multiplayer certainly does. I've realized the customization of weapons is so abundant, yet simple, that you will be able to craft the right weapon for your needs. The multiplayer maps are quite realistic. In fact I would not be surprised if they tried to replicate actual battlegrounds for the game. Either way, even if they didn't scrambling up the rubble of a half blown-up building is as satisfying as hearing the tap of my boots on the still-intact wood staircases. Combined with the graphics and audio delights described previously, the multiplayer is addictive.Overall this game is incredible. I feel like my money is well spent. I do not feel the need to spend more in a ""pay-to-win"" scenario. The single player campaign is satisfying and enveloping. The multiplayer is challenging, but not impossible once you find the right weapon to use. The game actually reminds me of Medal of Honor Allied Assault when it first came out - brilliant, just BRILLIANT!"

												I want to start off by saying I have a total of 2 hours on SP and over 15 hours on Zombies.Since the launch of Battfield 1, I knew this was coming. Treyarch and activition havent been putting a whole lot into their latest games, and I had very little expectations for this one. However, aside from the SP campaign being so god awful with their inaccuracies and storyline, I am quite surprised. I have yet to try MP since ive literally been stuck with my face to my screen playing zombies the last 2 days, but I feel I can say the same about it.Pros: There arent too many pros aside from Zombies being incredibly fun.Cons: Oh boy where do I start-I understand its a new game, but there are alot of issues with people still having errors and failure to launch. Still alot to fix with that department.-From the list of ""Minimum requirements"", its DRASTICALLY underminded. I am running with an i3-6100 with a 1050ti, 6gb ram (only 2 less than min required), and I am still having to play at 1280x720 with everything on low. Even THEN I am still having constant stuttering issues as well as FPS issues. On top of everything, they fail to tell you that you are REQUIRED to have both SP and MP installed and updated before you can play SP. I have horrible internet, so I waited overnight for SP to finish installing (which took 22 hours) and was greeted with something along the lines of ""You must have ww2 multiplayer installed and updated before conitnuing. Would you like to install now?"". so for me to even play SP, I had to wait another 7 hours."

Now this is my first year on pc I always been a console player but I recently got a gaming pc so I decided to give my favorite game fracnchise a chance on pc and it's perfect! (Now that tank mission in campaign sucks (ALOT) and I hope they change the controls because that is like impossible on keyboard and mouse!)

												I wouldn't say the game is bad, but it's just more of the same. I stopped playing the franchise for a while, but I wanted to give it a shot. Some mechanics were new to me but rather not interesting (for instance the one where you have to move the mouse to a specific circle on the screen. To me it's at most meaningless).The story, well, like any other American story .... the hero, his squad. It's full of cliches, having the good and the bad guys. The good americans pretending to save the world vs the evil Nazis.In general the game is full of bugs and really bad framerates (considering I have a relatively new machine). Publisher should be ashamed of charging 59 for that quality, but you evil guys won this time. You got my money.If you like all the above, buy it, otherwise save that money and buy something else."

												A good return to the 'boots on ground' we all knew and loved in call of duty titles of old. A lot of critics out there beating on this game before they give it a chance because of their history which is understandable, but for anyone looking at buying this game i would say give it go, give it a fair chance and try to be as unbiased as you posssibly can be. It might suprise you...."

												This is just a campaign review, there will be no spoilers. First of all I would just like to say this campaign isnt like any previous campaign. This campaign focuses more on the characters not killing a main villian. This was a good and bad thing. Why it was a good thing: You get attacted to the characters and makes you want to be a better solider. However the bad thing is that there is nothing for you to push to, or to grind out the campaign. There is almost no satisfaction at the end of the game unlike games like MW2 or MW3. All in all I would give the campaign a 6/10 I say this because the charcaters are great and you get attached to some of them. But I would buy the game for the campaign."

												I love this game, it's alot of fun. Campaign is great. I've played all the COD's since modern warfare and I've really gotten into the story, the characters and the settings. If you liked the other campaigns, you'll probably like this one.There is a ton of negative reviews out there for this game. Historical accuracy? Listen; you're playing call of duty. A video game. Get over it.  You want to count buttons and german insignia?  This really isn't the place you want to be doing that. If you spent $70 and are super angry that this game isn't historically accurate, then you just wasted your money I suppose.The one thing I hear over and over about this game and how bad it is seems to revolve around the fact that Germans are using the PPSH in Normandy.I'm over it.If you like the call of duty games, get it. If you want absoulte supreme historical accuracy with a complete absence of errors then...I dunno, go to your local library and get a book or something."

												This game is ""ok"" but it could be ""good"". I had major performance issues for quite a while even though my specs are wwwaaaayyy better than the minimum requirement. But the performance issues randomly went away half way through playing, idk why maybe there was an update but I just didn't know it. The multiplayer is good, its just the same old multiplayer but in a WW2 setting. The zombies is a lot of fun. But the single player is ""meh"", I can only remember a couple of the main character's names. The story is cliche, and there are references to Call of Duty: World at War, even though this game can't even compare to COD: WaW. I only really started getting invested into the story during the last couple of missions, and I found the single player got bland fast. This game is also very historically inaccurate, the first enemy's you encounter have a PPSH... a Soviet gun... the Soviets weren't even anywhere near D-Day. If this game were set on the Eastern Front with the Soviet Union, then it could be explained why a German soldier had a Soviet gun. The guns also fire nothing like the real things, the MG-42 and the PPSH need to fire WAY faster, and there are also no Swastikas except for in 1 place. The developers let the SJWs' win. I could ramble on for longer but I won't. If I could give this game a mutual rating I would, but I can only recommend or not recommend. Therefore I am going to give it a positive rating, this game has postive traits, I just decided to focus on the negatives."

												I havent been playing a lot of CoD titles since the franchise went futuristic. I started with CoD / CoD United Offensive, CoD 2 and then Modern Warfare. I played a little of MW2, Black Ops and World at War afterwards but somehow the feeling was gone. I bought or played the newer titles on free weekends and wasnt really interested at all anymore and my hope for playing a CoD again that is set in WW2 someday was high. I mean Battlefield did an awesome job with BF1 and so i hoped for CoD WW2 to do the same. For me the CoD WW2 woke some feelings of the old playstyle and i really love to play it. Some people argue about graphics or historical inaccuracies but come one it looks fine and its just a game. I liked the looks and the feeling of the campaign so far and i think the multiplayer with all its modes is overall fun to play. I didnt encounter any cheaters or problems with the game yet."

												Call of Duty: WWII is a great entry into the long-running series. Sledgehammer has done a fantastic job in creating a Call of Duty that will appeal to contemporary fans and those fans who might have favourable memories of earlier games in the series. Like me. It often walks a fine line between thoughtful representation of World War II and typical Call of Duty flamboyance, but it’s a line that Sledgehammer walks with absolute confidence. And they derserve to do so! The result is a Call of Duty that feels assured of what it’s trying to accomplish, and what it accomplishes is riveting, entertaining and at times hard-hitting. Do not even hesitate!Sledgehammer sure did a huge job repairing the issues showing in the Beta (well, an enormous amount of them at least) and it's a CoD playing exactly by the books."

												- It's kind of ridiculous the amount of hate this game is getting on PC. If you ""can't"" play this game then maybe upgrade your PC..? Instead of trying to play on a potato.- I haven't gotten any crashes or stuttering so far. I've played over 15 hours at this point including both single player as well as multiplayer. It runs great and I constantly get 120+ fps @ 1440p (Ultra Settings). My system specs: i7-6700K @ 4.5GHz - 16GB DDR4 @ 2800mhz - GTX 1080. Plus, this game is constantly getting updates (daily).- Campaign may not be historically accurate but it's still pretty fun. I enjoyed it, I do wish it was longer.. It's 8 hours long and includes missions where you can be stealth or go in guns blazing. It includes missions where you get to be a sniper, a tank driver-shooter, a pilot and you do your best to take out as many nazies as you possibly can.- Multiplayer feels faster paced than previous CoD games. It may take a little bit to get used to but once you do it's all fun from there on. There are many different kinds of gun and character customizations. New game modes are a plus although ""loot boxes"" aka ""supply drops"" should have been avoided IMO. Too many games now days use the loot boxes feature. If you weren't a fan of CoD multiplayer before then you won't like playing this one. The only negative thing I ran into while playing online is *hackers*. They mostly *aim-bot and wall-hack*. Other than that multiplayer is great. Besides there are hackers in every game so it's nothing new.. just annoying at times.- Nazi Zombies is a huge plus and a must have for CoD. It's extremely fun specially if you like playing co-op with your friends. I hope split-screen co-op feature gets added sometime down the road (should have been included in a first place).- Overall it's a pretty decent game and for those that do like CoD series should definitely give it a try at some point. I give it a solid 7.5 out of 10."

												I have played every Call of Duty to date. Most of the recent ones haven't been the best experience but this one breaks that cycle. I am a very big fan of the time period the game is set in (WWII), so I was excited to check it out. The multiplayer is fluid and doesnt get old, same thing for the zombies. The zombies is more scary this time around and I think that's a good thing. The story for the game is one of the best in any Call of Duty to date. So immersive and can be replayed without it being burnt out. I recommend this game to any COD fan that has been disapointed of the last few CODs."

I am still getting to know the many aspects of the multiplayer but it is easy and fun to get on to, with lots of fun little games in Headquarters.

												The campaign is a beautiful and rewarding experience.  If you don't end up enjoying the multiplayer part of the game, you haven't been totally robbed because the campaign is a blockbuster experience in itself.Multiplayer: I can see some of the frustrations people are having, but currently I am thoroughly enjoying it.  In every competitive sport and especially FPS games, you're always going to have a small percentage of people who take it too seriously or who try to spoil the fun.  As far as hacking/cheating:  Perhaps I'm just lucky, but I haven't caught anyone in the act of cheating, yet...    I do frequently encounter and enjoy some really skilled and technical players that often give me a run for my money.  In the same situations, I've also witnessed these players being accused of cheating because they are shooting well and scoring on the objectives...  I've found that the best thing to do is to just take a deep breath, push through and focus on playing your best.Overall:  The multiplayer provides high replayability.  This is actually a pretty decent game with stunning graphics.  There are certain multiplayer modes that are worth experiencing -they have their moments and they will bring you back to the battlefield, thirsty for more.    8/10"

It's not quite on the same level as modern warfare but it's damn close. I have read that a lot of people are having issues with performance and crashes but I did not experience any of this nor any game breaking bugs through out the whole camping.

												Okay... felt the need to write this review, first I've done.I feel, that so far the game is fantastic.I just finished the campaign and really... it just moved me. Now you have all these kids on here putting reviews up and saying many things, like, the Germans didn't use Russian Weapons, they gave into SJW issues and replaced the swastika.Okay... first off, Germans requsitioned Russian weapons around 1944, after the majority of their weapon factories had been bombed. Second. They used the Iron Cross as a symbol over their flags in addition to using the swastika. (Yes, the game still has swastikas. But all that aside, I'm a huge WW2 fanatic, and the story, and gameplay was breathtaking.Aside from, graphics are incredible. Forewarning though!!!! I ran this game with 8 gb of RAM. Had to run it on low settings, and still got frame studder, or freezes. But! The game looked amazing anyway. If you have 16 gb of RAM and at the least a GTX 900s series, you'll run this fine.Zombies: Meh, had some fun, don't have friends to play with. But there's so much to explore in the new mode.Multiplayer: What did I expect? A Infinite Warefare style experiance. I was honestly suprised, it felt like to me the game returned to some of their old COD 4 and W@W roots. This is the first game since COD W@W that I just love the multiplayer in, I cannot get enough!"

												(This review only covers the single player campaign)Stop me if you’ve heard this before – a country boy from the south, the invasion of Normandy. The campaign of Call of Duty: WWII is an amalgamation of things that we have seen before. The main thrust of the game is clearly inspired by the likes of Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and the countless WWII games that dominated the PS2-PS3 generations. There was a chance here to carve out their own path and Sledgehammer’s campaign is disappointingly boilerplate themes and tropes that we’ve seen retread many times over. Despite these shortcomings though, the campaign still succeeds.While the story may be overly wrought, there are enough new gameplay elements that make this campaign worth playing, the first being no regenerating health. Unlike many of the recent COD games you have no regenerating health and must instead use health packs. This definitely changed the way I played and forced me to use a bit more thought in my approach to situations. You feel a bit less Rambo-y, which is a good thing in my eyes. In addition to the new health system there are also squad commands. As you play through the game your squad can supply you with grenades, ammo and health packs when you are near them. While I’m a bit disappointed that you can’t command them a la Brothers in Arms, this was still an enjoyable addition and led to a more immersive experience.Another addition to the game is stealth, even going so far as to base a whole level around it. While it may be somewhat simple, I found it to be a nice pallet cleanser between some of the bigger set pieces, which are still great.The shooting still feels top notch although there are some rifles that felt shockingly weak as enemies took more bullets than necessary to go down. Once the game opens up a bit and you get to use more weapons I found this to be less of an issue.Clocking in at around seven hours, the campaign of COD: WWII is disappointing in some regards but still succeeds at a gameplay level which is to be expected from the franchise. I don’t want to bemoan it too much but I was let down by Sledgehammer’s story after the terrific Advanced Warfare. With WWII being Activision’s answer to Battlefield 1, it will be interesting to see where the franchise goes next. After the colossal letdown that was Black Ops 3 I hope that Treyarch can right the ship going forward."

												Honestly, I have no clue what people are talking about with the optimization, it is running as smooth as a baby's♥♥♥♥♥ Even my friends are running it fine and somehow COD automatically set rendering resolution to 400% and it was still rurnning as smooth as. This game is honestly the second best cod I have played and I love it, will never beat modern warfare 2 but this game is worth every penny. And for reference my friend has a GTX 960 and i5 4590 and he's running high with no fps drops or anything and there is never a point to where it drops below 60fps for me even with intense moving and grenades. So all in all, people with the negative reviews, I have no idea what is going on with your system but the game is optimized fairly well imo."

												I haven't owned a COD game since 2009 and it seems that with this title it is a good time to come back to the franchise, if you intend on throwing money at your screen. The game comes at a steep price if you include the season pass which in my opinion is overpriced. On top of this there are loot crates (microtransactions).If you actually plan on spending over a hundred dollars on a game to experience all of its content, then reviews won't matter to you. Your mind is already made up, buy it. However, I cannot recommend it due to these sh*tty loot crate, cut content sold as DLC practices.So yes... The game is fun but not worth the full price tag.If you're reading this as a die hard COD fanboy, your blood pressure is probably rising to dangerous levels. Just remember that this is my opinion and you don't need to pop a blood vessel just because I may disagree with you."

												I'm gonna be honest Just playing the beta was a major letdown due to hackers on day 1 of the beta. Like come TF on. DAY ONE!And after watching a video on zombies gameplay for this game, it was almost a refund right there. But this game is more of a game to play than watch on youtube if you understand what I'm getting at. The 1 zombies map was very enjoyable. Just wish there werent so many boss zombies and less trying to run around just to packapunch though. I had like 4 bosses at once. It really is a great map. But plz make a map with just regular zombies and such. :). Other than that the zombies mode is perfect.Graphics are fantastic and so far there hasnt been any serious lag spikes. So optimization is on point this time (so far). And adding the VRAM bar was an excellent idea. I don't know why every game ever made has that feature.I have'nt tried multiplayer yet, for obviouse reasons, but ill give it a shot and update review in a few months if its worth it."

												So far so good. I've successfully completed the first mission - D-Day - it took just over an hour on regular difficulty (medium) including cut scenes and deaths. It was fluid and furious. If I wasn't already failiar with the D-Day capaigns of old (and Private Ryan) i'd have been entirely blown away - newcomers rejoice. Great gun play and audio. Graphics ran absolutely flawless at Ultra Settings 4k 60fps using 4930k, GTX 1080Ti and 64GB ram. Although I'm only an hour in it is evident that this game certainly doesn't deserve the negative remarks it's recieving. Shame on you 'gamers' that love to (lie and) hate. I'll update the review once I've completed the game but needed to give my first impressions in a see of negativity from those that have played 40 mins only yet claim to be on the 5th mission!"

												*Mainly Campaign*Alright, so i see alot of negative reviews on the new CoD. I just wanna tell you, most of them are right, some of them wrong in different ways. I am not a huge fan of CoD. Never played the old ones, so i don't know what this is supposed to live up to, but you have to cut Sledgehammer and Activision some slack. Though i do truely hate that they gave the Wehrmacht SVT-40's and PPsH's, the campaign is decently good. I know they promised for it to be historical, and in some ways it is. The story of Ronald ""Red"" Daniels is most likely not true, but it is good fun. In Activision's defense, they can't keep making a WW2 shooter with a 100% historical campaign. Eventually you will run out of stories to tell. From what i saw when my brother was playing it in the days, the old games got mostly the whole of WW2 covered. You can't do much more. Therefore we have to start getting creative. I don't know what it is with people when they see a game that takes place in the past, they expect it to be 100% historical. We can't keep picking on games for doing things like this. And yes i do know that Activision and Sledgehammer both said it would be as historical as they could make it, i do find it a bit annoying they didn't make it more historical. But to be honest, they do cover the moving of the frontline pretty good. They follow the plot of the end of the war pretty good. That's all.Don't be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and follow the group :)"

												After 168 hrs in the multiplayer/zombies and finishing the campaign, i think that this game is 100% worth the 60 dollar pricetag, Im currently almost done with prestige 4 and have diamond on almost everything. The weapon balance in this game is good, there arent any guns besides the shotguns that are underpowered, my only complain are the full auto ar's. The progresion system is good and doesnt involve lootboxes. Lootboxes are only cosmetic and you can earn the new guns in the winter siege by compleating challanges. The gamemodes are standard cod and war is great, especialy for weapon challanges. Moving on to zombies, the casual easteregg is a lot of fun and the hardcore one leaves something to be desired, otherwise this is a standard zombie expirience. The campaign is great too, you get to play as a n american solidair with his squad, the characters are somewhat memorable, but nowhere near ethan from iw. And the change in health regen did this game a favor. If you are a cod fan, you most probably got this game already and font regret the purchase but if you are new to the frenchise, this game wont let you down and if you get it on a discount, then its a steal."

												This game brings ""Boots on the Ground"" back which is amazing. Like every game, CoD: WWII has positives and negatives. I will list all the pros and cons of every part (Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer) that I experienced. This will hopefully help you decide better! Some spoilers included (maybe? You decide if it counts as a spoiler). TL;DR at the end.CampaignPros-The campaign is wonderful and introduces some new interesting features that I believe impact the campaign positively. Besides the features, the storyline I found quite intriguing. For the collectors, the campaign includes mementos, 3 per mission, which are basically intel in previous games. There are also new events where you either save an ally, force the enemy to surrender, or drag an ally to safety, all of which are named as Heroic Actions.-One outstanding thing for me are the cutscenes, especially the cinematic ones. The cinematic cutscenes look so surprisingly real. You can visibly see the emotions of the characters and immerses me more.-The campaign adds an actual health bar along with the normal HUD. This is because now, to heal, you need to use a health kit now. Therefore, throughout the areas of the campaign, you can find health kits to heal up.-Besides finding health kits on the floor, you can ask one of your allies to throw you one. The campaign now adds some allies who, upon request, can give you some bonuses. One will give you ammo, another can highlight every enemy, etc. This adds some unique strategy as to when you should use their ability. The abilities aren't a one time event however, as, after enough kills, you can use the ability again.-There's also a new detection system for stealth missions. Enemies now have an indicator above them to show if you are detected or not, which I quite enjoy.Cons-The campaign feels somewhat short for me. There are only 11 missions with no optional missions. I don't remember the amount of missions in past CoDs, however, I was able to finish the campaign on Veteran in 6 hours, which seems too little of time.-Controlling the vehicles are somewhat clunky. Excluding driving the jeep, the tank and plane driving is weird, which might just be because of my low sensitivity and/or mouse+keyboard. Might be more smooth on controller. With the plane, I find myself turning farther than I intended while on the tank, strafing is difficult and occasionally found myself stuck on debris because of this.Zombies*Note: This is the first zombies I have played so I'm unsure of how previous zombies played. However, I have some knowledge based on watching videos. Because of this, I will list the features and you can decide if they're positive or negative.Neutral-This zombies has a class system in which you can choose your perks and weapons. This means there's a level system like in multiplayer.-There are new ""ultimates"" which take a while to charge and are quite powerful, such as giving you infinite ammo or the ability to not be targetted by the zombies. Some of the perks boosts these ""ultimates"" or give some bonuses.-There's a prologue section which can serve to help new players. Can be helpful.-There's only one other map, the Final Reich, besides the Prologue.-On the Final Reich map, you are given objectives which serve to help complete the main Easter Egg.-You can't repair windows and put up barriers.-There's a new ""Armor"" system which serves as extra health. Every time you buy more, the armor becomes more expensive.-Perk bottles have been replaced with a little machine that zaps the perk into you.-There's a special shovel ability you can perform that will instantly kill a zombie and give you some bonuses.-Money has been replaced with JoltsMultiplayer*Note: Again, my review is based on my experiences and not on what others have experienced. This is my opinion which may differ from others.Pros-Headquarters is a unique idea as a way for people to gather. At the headquarters, you can test out scorestreaks or fire weapons. You can 1v1 another person or you can commend people. You can collect your daily reward and mail at the Mail station. At the Quartermaster, you can use your COD Points, buy contracts, and complete collections (which rewards you with weapon or uniform variants). Here you can also receive your Daily and Weekly Orders which serve as bonus challenges to get bonus XP or a supply drop. The other NPCs in the Headquarters include a NPC that allows you to prestige your Division, another where you can prestige your Guns, and a NPC where you can prestige your Soldier.-The customization extends past the calling card and emblem. You're able to change your soldier's uniform (only for Allies), change the face of your soldier. You have emotes and you can choose to wear different helmets or just have none at all. There are also pistol grips to add a little flare to your sidearms.-WWII introduces a new War mode which contains 3 different unique maps. I quite enjoy War because of the different ""style"" of gameplay. The attackers must complete objectives and upon doing so, pushes the defenders back to the next section, which keeps going until the attackers complete the final objective or the defenders hold back the attackers until the time runs out. The only available scorestreaks is a flamethrower which is dropped in by a care package. There's only one flamethrower given per section of the map and most of the time given to the defenders. Although one or two people can carry a team, teamwork makes the dream work.Neutral-The Create-a-Class system has been revamped and changed. Instead of perks there are now divisions and basic trainings (BTs). There are five divisions, Infantry, Mountain, Airborne, Armored, and Expeditionary. Each comes with different bonuses that you get from leveling up the divisions. You can also prestige the divisons, resetting all your bonuses and giving you either a new weapon, calling card, uniform, or weapon variant.-You can only choose one BT to have, which serve as perks. You can choose to quieter footsteps or have a rocket launcher or have enemies appear on the radar. I think the BTs are cool, but need to be reworked.-There are a variety of guns, however, some feel underpowered. The Time-to-Kill on some of the weapons feel high and more often than not, when using these weapons, I either die eventhough I shoot first or the enemy gets away. This could also be because of lag compensation and whatnot.-The scorestreaks are varied and stick with the time period. I feel they are balanced for what they are, however may be to difficult to shoot down at times.Cons-Hackers are starting to ruin the game and it seems there hasn't been a response by SHG. Reporting them doesn't feel to do anything and sometimes will crash your game.-The maps need to be expanded upon. Some of the current maps are unbalanced and unfun to play on. There are also very few maps, I believe 9 from what I remember reading, which hinders the game.TL;DR - Get this game for the campaign and zombies, hoping for improvements to multiplayer in the future. Campaign is innovative and fun, but also seemingly short. Because I haven't played previous versions of zombies, I have nothing to compared WWII's zombies to. But, I think this zombies is scary and enjoyable to play. The different aspects are interesting. Multiplayer introduces a new create-a-class system which I like, but needs to be expanded upon. The headquarters is a cool section and I believe is fine where it's at. There are some cool customization options although somewhat limited. On the downside, there are few enjoyable maps and there seems to be more hackers everyday with little to no action being done.If you can remain positive and hope that SHG is able to fix issues with multiplayer, then you should buy this game. If not for multiplayer, at least the campaign and zombies are amazing."

												My expectations for this game weren’t to high and I was afraid that it wouldn’t live up to the hype. But... when I soon after I started playing the game I understood that that I was wrong this game was one of the most fun games I have ever played.The story is great and the multiplayer is exceptionally well. So who is this game for:1. People that have the money cuz this game is so freaking prissy.2. People that like or are fine with playing single player because single player is one of the best and main things in the game plus the multiplayer is fine but not as fun as other multiplayer games like CSGO but we still need to wait a little bit before we know if it’s good or just fine because not enough people are playing at the moment so some game mods like capture the flag, nazi zombies and more are not working cuz not Enough people are playing at the moment. and also more updates are coming so that also may make the experience better. Again the game came out yesterday so the game may become better in the future from updates."

												I'm gonna be honest Just playing the beta was a major letdown due to hackers on day 1 of the beta. Like come TF on. DAY ONE!And after watching a video on zombies gameplay for this game, it was almost a refund right there. But this game is more of a game to play than watch on youtube if you understand what I'm getting at. The 1 zombies map was very enjoyable. Just wish there werent so many boss zombies and less trying to run around just to packapunch though. I had like 4 bosses at once. It really is a great map. But plz make a map with just regular zombies and such. :). Other than that the zombies mode is perfect.Graphics are fantastic and so far there hasnt been any serious lag spikes. So optimization is on point this time (so far). And adding the VRAM bar was an excellent idea. I don't know why every game ever made has that feature.I have'nt tried multiplayer yet, for obviouse reasons, but ill give it a shot and update review in a few months if its worth it."

												Finally, a call of duty game thats 70% worth playing, The SP is so far, flawless, with zero performence issues, The zombies is decent though the lack of maps is going to get old faster then normal.MP is ok-ish at best, the lack of hardcore modes, zero dedicated server, and no server browser is going to kill this quick, The ""hub"" were 47 other people can hang out on the beach is not going to help ether. Lucky for everyone the drop creats don't mean @##% to the game play ether. so u can play the MP and never have to worry aobut using or other people using items from the drop crates...but deffentlly the best cod game in the past 10 years...

I have explained this to steam to get a refund but they feel that I have played to many hours.. really I have not played that many hours cause I have been in the game trying to trouble shot the issues I was having and nothing worked... very disappointed with Activision and steam... they should except all returns with in 14 days.. I mean you go to a store you try the game if it's not what you expected or having system issues they let you return it.. steam should follow the same protocol.. 2 hours is too short.. should be like 20 if there is any hours.."

												REVIEW HAS TWO PARTS, first part was written after completing first missioin, second part is later, written after completing the campaig.[ I installed this game, optimized it, and ran it with no problems. Any errors codes people may have encountered could be issues running it due to hardware or the installation. ]Had a lot of fun playing the game (only finished the first level in campaign) and enjoyed the gameplay and of course the visuals. Mission objectives are simple but the map layout keeps the player choosing routes or methods without straying from the arcade-style linear story shooter. Of course I think it's all fine and dandy that this wasn't done like an action movie (like many of the past CoD games from MW to IW) since it follows that true events and real life actions of a war that was fought during a time when young men were lying about their age to serve their country and fight the Japanese and Nazi war machines. I have yet to play more (it's 4 am on release day as I write this) but I feel that the relationship between characters and the attention to detail - physical and historical - is what has made this game stand out so far. Some might say it's nostalgia. For example, once again storming the beaches of Normandy like many gamers have doen countless times in so many past titles. But I might argue that ""nostalgia"" -  if you could even describe a historical game in such a way - has nothing to do with why I enjoy this game. It is done simply: the history is there and has existed for decades, and Call of Duty: WW2 delivers it without censoring anything. The realism is forced upon you, the bloodshed and the onslaught and the death. Of course I have yet to play more. And I have not even touched the multiplayer yet. As for many of the other reviews I have read - mostly whining about crash errors due to an abundance of incapable PCs - I would add that players save their reviews for the game itself, rather than of your crash errors. Maybe fixing the errors would help your experience (since I had no errors at all). If crash errors made a bad game then Deus Ex would be one of the worst games ever made since it was released 17 years ago and can barely run without problems on modern computers.-FOLLOWING WAS ADDED AFTER COMPLETING CAMPAIGN (9 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY)-So I just completed the campaign on veteran difficulty (which wasn't all that hard since the game on veteran isn't nearly as dreadful as CoD 4 or CoD:WaW on the same difficulty where the grenades fall like snow in the Alps)...To add on to my previous comments, I will say that the game continues to bear its realistic and intense gameplay well. The story is engulfing and the dialogue and even the character developement brings a whole new layer to the WW2-based story game genre. Instead of the past COD games where you're either am unkillable badass who can take on the Nazis alone (CoD 1-3, 5), or you're a Jason Bourne/James Bond/Bruce Willis chap who can pull the craziest stunts in the history of action games (CoD 4, MW2, MW3, BLOPS, etc). In CoD:WW2 it is constantly presented to the player that you alone cannot win by yourself; your bestfriend is good cover and concealment (on veteran you may use smokes more than frags). Your squad mates give you supplies that benefit substantially to the progression of the game, especially those precious medical kits and mortar strikes. Of course these supplies could have been game-ruining if they were more consistently available or if they were more affective. I have not played any difficutly other than veteran, but I know that despite the availability of medical kits, it is still very difficult to remain unhurt for long. On that note, here are some negatives: the enemy are much too accurate with their weapons, and they can take shots like they're being hit by metal BBs. The CoD4:MW - CoD:MW3 enemies require less shots to be downed - which is more realistic - and this is during the age of flak jackets and kevlar. So it is a little annoying when, in a war where body armor did not exist in the modern G.I. infantry kit, it takes almost an entire magazine of any SMG or semi-auto carbine/rifle in the game to take down a bad guy. And no, headshots do NOT always kill in one hit. SMG bullets sometimes ""deflect"" off of the Nazi helmets. This of course is strange considering that - despite the possibility of a sub-sonic bullet actually being able to do this, I would argue that the .30 Carbine projectile (fired from the M1 Carbine, a common campaign weapon), which is basically a lever-action munition with slightly less powder, would not likely (at all) take 4-8 shots to kill a human being. Could just be the difficulty, which I will find out sooner than later since I am aiming to replay the game on regular and find those illusive mementos. Now about the characters and the story!Call of Duty: WW2 delivers intense gameplay and creative, intricate missions and terrain while accelerating it with the engine of storytelling through lovable and emotional characters - that is to say, the US Army soldiers to whom you belong really do feel like your friends in a way and love to hear them speak to you and to see them fight alonside you. The cutscenes before and after missions allow you to see deeper into the lives of these American soldiers which surfaces a little more about their personalities and history with the Army. The ""tough but just"" Lieutenant Turner is the focused lens of the US Army's system and order. He seems to be young but seasoned, having served with SFC Pierson for quite some time. SFC Pierson is the ""rough-and-tumble hardass"", a mean and relentless soldier who seems to have an insecurity linking back to a prior campaign. This shadow of regret hangs over him the entire campaign and affects the squad both negatively and positively. SFC Pierson is the driving force behind the depth of the characters, his attitude and personality and tactical choices charge the squad with both good and bad feelings and often times change the mission. The rest of the squad are the loyal and lovable warriors who share a valuable friendship with one another. Their life and fighting spirit embody the stories and tales from that great World War and bring to life that ethos spoken so intricately and emotionally about by those who lived in those dark times. It becomes obvious very early on that despite the hardships and trials, it was - and IS - the propellant to the desire and motivation to move forward, to survive, to fight, and the live. There really is not much to say about the game except a vast list of positives and some negatives that would not stop be from buying the game, should not stop you from playing it, and will not stop me from playing it again.Gameplay/Story: 90/100Atmosphere/Graphics: 100/100Mechanics: 80/100Replayability: 85/100Genre Significance: 94/100Overall: 90/100"

Cool gamemodes, balanced weapons and few glitches (Will probably be fixed in a upcoming patch)Zombies- After treyarchs great story of zombies i have personally got a liking for this story where it shows a lot of cool nazi myths which brings upon a zombie apocalypse. the game is great to be played with friends but gets a bit boring when played with friends.Finally i should say this call of duty is worth to buy as its back to the roots and has great gameplay and graphics."

												*Mainly Campaign*Alright, so i see alot of negative reviews on the new CoD. I just wanna tell you, most of them are right, some of them wrong in different ways. I am not a huge fan of CoD. Never played the old ones, so i don't know what this is supposed to live up to, but you have to cut Sledgehammer and Activision some slack. Though i do truely hate that they gave the Wehrmacht SVT-40's and PPsH's, the campaign is decently good. I know they promised for it to be historical, and in some ways it is. The story of Ronald ""Red"" Daniels is most likely not true, but it is good fun. In Activision's defense, they can't keep making a WW2 shooter with a 100% historical campaign. Eventually you will run out of stories to tell. From what i saw when my brother was playing it in the days, the old games got mostly the whole of WW2 covered. You can't do much more. Therefore we have to start getting creative. I don't know what it is with people when they see a game that takes place in the past, they expect it to be 100% historical. We can't keep picking on games for doing things like this. And yes i do know that Activision and Sledgehammer both said it would be as historical as they could make it, i do find it a bit annoying they didn't make it more historical. But to be honest, they do cover the moving of the frontline pretty good. They follow the plot of the end of the war pretty good. That's all.Don't be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and follow the group :)"

												The game brought back memories of earlier COD WWII titles, SP combat, graphics and animations are great. Cut scenes are nice and story is not bad. I would love more SP content and missions. Multiplayer if thats your thing is fine but not a fan of the bunny hopping and usual MP nonsense. War mode does make it more enjoyable, I would say bring in more sounds and atmosphere of a war in the MP. Many of negative posts are alot of preference issues and PC issues. I have no issues playing and enjoying the game many need to look at there own systems a bit. This is a AAA game and the norm is $60 to ♥♥♥♥♥ about it should be $10 less is nonsense. No game is perfect but this is highly enjoyable and COD series is the only games I think I ever finished the Storyline and have me playing again at higher level.I would agree on some of the realism concerns, use of some weapons that maybe should not have been in the area, and use of whatever unique uniform or customization in MP takes me out of immersion but again its MP and not a game breaker.Sledge/Activison make more SP content! and a free DLC here and there will go a long way."

If crash errors made a bad game then Deus Ex would be one of the worst games ever made since it was released 17 years ago and can barely run without problems on modern computers.-FOLLOWING WAS ADDED AFTER COMPLETING CAMPAIGN (9 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY)-So I just completed the campaign on veteran difficulty (which wasn't all that hard since the game on veteran isn't nearly as dreadful as CoD 4 or CoD:WaW on the same difficulty where the grenades fall like snow in the Alps)...To add on to my previous comments, I will say that the game continues to bear its realistic and intense gameplay well. The story is engulfing and the dialogue and even the character developement brings a whole new layer to the WW2-based story game genre. Instead of the past COD games where you're either am unkillable badass who can take on the Nazis alone (CoD 1-3, 5), or you're a Jason Bourne/James Bond/Bruce Willis chap who can pull the craziest stunts in the history of action games (CoD 4, MW2, MW3, BLOPS, etc). In CoD:WW2 it is constantly presented to the player that you alone cannot win by yourself; your bestfriend is good cover and concealment (on veteran you may use smokes more than frags). Your squad mates give you supplies that benefit substantially to the progression of the game, especially those precious medical kits and mortar strikes. Of course these supplies could have been game-ruining if they were more consistently available or if they were more affective. I have not played any difficutly other than veteran, but I know that despite the availability of medical kits, it is still very difficult to remain unhurt for long. On that note, here are some negatives: the enemy are much too accurate with their weapons, and they can take shots like they're being hit by metal BBs. The CoD4:MW - CoD:MW3 enemies require less shots to be downed - which is more realistic - and this is during the age of flak jackets and kevlar. So it is a little annoying when, in a war where body armor did not exist in the modern G.I. infantry kit, it takes almost an entire magazine of any SMG or semi-auto carbine/rifle in the game to take down a bad guy. And no, headshots do NOT always kill in one hit. SMG bullets sometimes ""deflect"" off of the Nazi helmets. This of course is strange considering that - despite the possibility of a sub-sonic bullet actually being able to do this, I would argue that the .30 Carbine projectile (fired from the M1 Carbine, a common campaign weapon), which is basically a lever-action munition with slightly less powder, would not likely (at all) take 4-8 shots to kill a human being. Could just be the difficulty, which I will find out sooner than later since I am aiming to replay the game on regular and find those illusive mementos. Now about the characters and the story!Call of Duty: WW2 delivers intense gameplay and creative, intricate missions and terrain while accelerating it with the engine of storytelling through lovable and emotional characters - that is to say, the US Army soldiers to whom you belong really do feel like your friends in a way and love to hear them speak to you and to see them fight alonside you. The cutscenes before and after missions allow you to see deeper into the lives of these American soldiers which surfaces a little more about their personalities and history with the Army. The ""tough but just"" Lieutenant Turner is the focused lens of the US Army's system and order. He seems to be young but seasoned, having served with SFC Pierson for quite some time. SFC Pierson is the ""rough-and-tumble hardass"", a mean and relentless soldier who seems to have an insecurity linking back to a prior campaign. This shadow of regret hangs over him the entire campaign and affects the squad both negatively and positively. SFC Pierson is the driving force behind the depth of the characters, his attitude and personality and tactical choices charge the squad with both good and bad feelings and often times change the mission. The rest of the squad are the loyal and lovable warriors who share a valuable friendship with one another. Their life and fighting spirit embody the stories and tales from that great World War and bring to life that ethos spoken so intricately and emotionally about by those who lived in those dark times. It becomes obvious very early on that despite the hardships and trials, it was - and IS - the propellant to the desire and motivation to move forward, to survive, to fight, and the live. There really is not much to say about the game except a vast list of positives and some negatives that would not stop be from buying the game, should not stop you from playing it, and will not stop me from playing it again.Gameplay/Story: 90/100Atmosphere/Graphics: 100/100Mechanics: 80/100Replayability: 85/100Genre Significance: 94/100Overall: 90/100"

												First off I was very excited for this game.. but I have played over 15 hours of multiplayer and there are in game issues.. servers are garbage cont kicking you out of in middle games.. glitches are horrific at times makes it very unplayable... I have explained this to steam to get a refund but they feel that I have played to many hours.. really I have not played that many hours cause I have been in the game trying to trouble shot the issues I was having and nothing worked... very disappointed with Activision and steam... they should except all returns with in 14 days.. I mean you go to a store you try the game if it's not what you expected or having system issues they let you return it.. steam should follow the same protocol.. 2 hours is too short.. should be like 20 if there is any hours.."

												First and foremost, ignore all the negative reviews from the people who were only complaining about the servers being down for a couple minutes on day 1.Now that we got that out the way, let's get onto an actual review. The game runs fine for me, a few stutters here and there but that's mostly at the beginning of a match. Some people have higher specs than me and I run this game on a smooth 100 - 130 FPS on high settings with my gear. - i5 6600k 3.50Ghz- GTX 1060- 8 GBs ramIf you're lagging that bad and have higher specs than me, just turn it down. You don't need ultra settings on every game. From what I've experienced on the beta compared to now, the game has improved greatly in the multiplayer aspects, and yes, I know it was just the beta. Such as the guns and the whole collection of things is also a nice touch. Adding contracts and daily/weekly missions to the game to make you feel like you actually have something to do and recieve a actually valuable reward instead of some number that keeps going up each time you level and a little prestige badge like other CoD games. These missions give you supply crates that actually hold some value, like adding more outfits or gun camos to your collection, the spectrum is very wide with what you can get from them.The social aspect of this game is incredible in my honest opinion, I love the headquarters without a doubt. You can watch other people open up crates, have a nice shootout contest between your friends, and even settle some beef in a 1v1. The social aspect was a very good touch in my opinion, allowing players access to pick up contracts and turn them in for rewards as said above.Zombies. Is. Amazing. I love the whole linear aspect of it, the hectic gameplay, the spooktastic jumpscares that the character reacts to which also gets me pretty good. The quests and actually having something to do constantly instead of mindlessly killing zombies is a nice idea, and I do hope there is more zombie maps.All in all, if you like a simple Call of Duty like how it used to be, boots on the ground instead of exo packs flying in the air, I would pick it up if I were you."

As long as your computer doesn't suck, you update your graphics card drivers, it runs great.The game reminds me of World at War which was one of my favorite COD games.

How is it possible that this sh it happens again and again? HOW?NOW this:It's been 3 weeks after the release - still no anti-cheat in place. You will get a cheater every 5 games on average. Reporting doesn't make any difference.Game is unfinished, not every option works - emblem editor for example - random lag in MP (perhaps their version of lag compensation which penlizes people with good ping in favor of people with mediocre ping - yes I use a good mouse and can tell when there is a lag)Buggy lobbies, sometimes the game just kicks you out - connection to servers lost - HOW is that possible??

												Don't believe all of these lying asses. The campaign is not short. The only way I can see someone completing the campaign within 7 hours is if they are on the easiest difficulty in the game, in that case they don't deserve to have their opinion heard if they play on the easiest difficulty then complain that the campaign is short. Hell I bet I could beat Mass Effect 2's main story within 7 hours if I put it on the easiest difficulty. I've only played the campaign so far on hardened mode and within ten hours have not finished it, so I cannot review the entire game at the moment, however I will say that the campaign is one of the best in series. It will really immerse you into WW2 in an experience and sensation I have not felt since COD 2 - unless you are a historian familiar with the era. (which I am not - I am more familiar with antiquity) But, if you have ever wanted to be your own Saving Private Ryan but with modern graphics then here you go I guess. If not, then it's not for you. Edit: You may read a lot of people saying that there are some out of places guns and uniforms (which I did not catch - as I mentioned before the overwhelming majority of my knowledge of historical events is not related to the 20th century) The historical inconsistencies do bother me but not that much considering I had to read reviews mentioning them and then actively look for them to find them. But now that I have played more of the game, some of the game (cough cough multiplayer) is pandering to SJWs. You will find black female soldiers fighting on the germany army in multiplayer, which is absurd and should not be a thing. However, I gave this a positive review because I had fun on this game, and in the end, this is a GAME which people refuse to realize most of the time. As long as it's fun, sure I will give it a positive review. They are not trying to be a complete, exact virtual recreation of WW2."

It is a cod game so expect the same gameplay but overall have brought back what mostly people love about cod with some extra cool cotent.

												Part 1:Story/CampaignOut of the CODs from previous years, this one is a step up trying to bring historical action to the viewers eyes and hands. Graphics are excellent, but unfortunately unlike COD:W@W limbs are less realistic in destruction. After AI dies no fun time with shooting the enemy corpse to see if you can riddle them with bullets for limbs to come off. Other than that, the destructable environment later in campaign makes for more immersive feel. It is worth to get this game for this gamemode.Part 2:MultiplayerSame old Same old. From what i remember W@W was a little bit better in the regards to it. Feels more like a copy paste of the previous call of duties. As always for PC expect the cheaters. *fan of the cancer buy this if not part 1 and part 3 are better reasons to play this game.Part 3:The games Nazi-Zombie mode doesnt fail to impress, and is still worth it especially playing with friends.

												Oh boy, Call Of Duty WWII, just got done playing the campaign so this review will be based off only the campaign.First off, I'd like to say that this game was (in my opinion) supposed to be a war simulation, that's what they had at their core when they first made games like COD 2 or COD World at War. You start out as some private and just follow orders from your squad leader or just follow the diamond wherever it told you to go while mindlessly killing Germans or the Japanese (in the case of World at War in those few missions). That's all war is and I appreciate the authenticity that those 2 games offered. But COD WWII was a bit different.Call Of Duty WWII was the next COD after Infinite Warfare which had a lot of criticism because of the lack of new places that you could be. So Infinity Ward took that as ""We need to make a game set in some other place other than the future"" and so they decided on WWII, not a bad idea, right? I think so. The first mission starts you out of the most influential battle in WWII, D-Day. June 6th, 1944, you briefly meet up with your squad before you are thrown on your boat on its way to Normandy Beach, and let me tell you, I LOVE D-Day, it is probably my favorite battle next to the battle for Stalingrad, so I was pretty hyped up for this mission. Pretty typical starting, you start getting shot at and the bullet sounds are phenomenal, the cracks and whizzing of gunfire really get me immersed in the setting. Your sergeant tells you to lower the door and all hell breaks lose, your allies are getting shot left and right and after the gunfire ends, you have a body on top of you with half its skull missing and gore is everywhere. You climb the side of the boat and are greated by your squad leader telling you to storm the beach. Then the rest of the mission is up to you. I'm going to stop spoiling it there but that sums up the best part of this game.Now onto the negatives, guns are not accurate for the time nor are they accurate in general. The M1928 that you see Pierson holding is not a military issue ""Thompson"", those guns do not have a drum magazine nor a grip. The Kar 98k with an extended magazine has a clip instead of it being a strip mad loaded version. Every scoped Kar 98k has a bracelet along the scope stand. The M1 Garand does not need to have the action slammed shut every time you reload because there is a spring that automatically pushes it forward when you pull it back after you reload it. That's just the problems with the guns.Now the story, without spoiling it too much, it is more of a story telling game of a heroic soldier who just couldn't die instead of it being about what I mentioned earlier which was a war simulation. The story is compelling at times and can get you immersed which is defiantly not a bad thing but all I'm trying to say is that they didn't really go back to what made Call Of Duty good, they just put COD in the WWII setting and kept doing what they have been doing with other titles such as Black Ops, Advanced and Infinite Warfare, which was making action movies instead of war simulators.But all in all, regardless of everything I just said, I would recommend Call Of Duty WWII because the story really got my immersed and wanting more and more of what happens next and it defiantly isn't a bad purchase, I can't wait to see what they do with the Zombies mode, but thats another topic for another day.I would say that COD WWII gets a:7/10 for story telling6/10 for combat8/10 for overall enjoyment5/10 for authenticity and realism"

Classic Multiplayer ,nice zombie mode and okay campaign. Call of duty is what it is guys, a big action packed game. so like it or not, it is what it is. I like it its fun to play and thats what gaming is to me . Hopefully they will patch the very few bugs people are getting but overall, good experience for me . :)"

I just don't understand at what point COD has ever been team based and people have been quickscoping sense COD 4! Also what is the big deal that you can be a black female and have the LGBT flag as your callingcard?? What's wrong with other people getting to be represented?

												The campaign truly shows the sheer brutality of war. There are several characters ranging with different rankings like Private Sergeant ETC but you get attached to them. The AI are alright, but there are random heroic moments, where a Nazi might be struggling with an ally and you save the ally. It gets you points and reaches the special ""bonus"" of a different ally. For example ""Turner"" has ammo, ""Russman"" has meds and ""Pierson"" has binoculars. Its a great campaign so far!"

												Campaign was very fun while it lasted, good story; sometimes lacked the character building but other than that it was fun.Multiplayer is the funnest since MW3 for me. I haven't purchased any COD games since BO2 but played them all and for me this does do what it promised in terms of bringing Call of Duty back. The maps are small, it is built so many confrontations will occur, and quickly. By doing this it sometimes is too easy to get on an enemies spawn and take down 10 people before they know how to react. As a very bad zombies player I didn't play the mode much, but really it has David Tennant in it so it must be good ;) did play a couple of rounds and did have fun while it lasted and I can't wait to see how it ties in with the overall zombies story.Overall, this is a game for CoD fans, it doesn't do anything special apart from those campaign graphics which I'm sure has been topped in other games. It doesn't try to break ground, as it has tried to do this before and failed. It will see improvement through updates, which it does need, but nothing to stress over. I believe this game to be a 6/10 for non CoD players and a 8/10 for OG's. So 7/10. Hope this is helpful"

												OK heres a brief pros and cons on this game's campaign.Pros--Animations (both cut scenes and actual gameplay) are extremely well done. It is very realistic.-The Story is very well done, can connect to the characters and so on.-DOES touch on many different battles that occured on the Western Front, including Battle of the Bulge, D-Day, and so on. (D-day mission was very realistic and as if I was controlling Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan lol)-Gameplay is fun and intense, you wont get bored.Cons--The Historical Inaccuracy in the game is fairly evident. Many guns that the Germans are using were not available to them at the time and place this game took place. Uniforms also seemed a little out of place. Also there is a black man that fights with you toward the end. The Army was segregated at the time so not sure why he is there?-The Campaign was rather short in my opinion. Not saying it was only a few missions, you still get to do a lot, just felt it could have been a little longer.-The back and forth between the Swastika and the Cross. This kind of feeds back into the Historical Inacurracy. As other reviews have stated in the gameplay you rarely see a swastika but then during the cutscenes it changes to mainly swastikas. Kind of confusing.-The lagging and pontential crashes. Although my game ran flawlessly, I felt I should put this in since its apparent others have ran into this problem. Many users have experience lagging and crashes during or right before the mission starts. JUst something to keep in mind if you are running an older PC. In conclusion, the realism of the animations and intense gameplay made this game extremely enjoyable for me. If you are someone who cares more about how historically accurate the game is than the gameplay itself, this is NOT the game for you. But I do personally think you should give this game a chance. I am a huge WWII history buff and have been patiently for this game to come out for a while. Even though I read the nasty reviews about it, I gave it a chance and I am glad I did. Great game overall and you will not be disapointed with purchasing it!"

Review: Call of Duty: WWII Graphics:Maybe it's the setting that makes the game look a lot better  than the previous ones or they just made a good with this one. Personally i do consider the cutscenes extremely beautiful and jaw dropping and add to the experience quite a lot.In game the game looks pretty nice too as most of the Textures were sharp, it had some crazy effects and a beautiful level design (Visually). The Sounds are high quality too. All in all i can only say that they improved a lot in my opinion.[ 9 out of 10  ]Gameplay:There are not many changes but there were some pretty significant ones.You do not have Health Regeneration which reminds me a lot of the older games and do not understand why it did not get noticed a lot more. You can ask your Comrades to give you Ammo or other things which in my opinion is another good change ( Like some Medal of Honor games ). Other than these major changes it is your classic fast combat gameplay we had for a decade now.[ 8 out of 10  ]Story:There will be no spoilers or not any major ones atleast!The Story is rather short as it is in most Call of Duty games. You will get around 6 or 7 hours out of it.A lot have different opinions, but i would say that with the action and interest this Campaign brings you get more than enough. What i did not like was that the story is ""robbing"" you of the ability to play the story the way you want.What i mean with that is that the Campaign has invisible checkpoints that trigger various ""scenes"".Bolt Example: Enemy is on the roof of a building. You use your sniper to take him out but can't until you trigger the next checkpoint. Other than that it is another classical Call of Duty story, that sadly feels a little ""old"".[ 7,5 out of 10  ]Multiplayer:I haven't played that much Multiplayer ( 2 hours online and another 4 were i had selected to be visible as offline )So i cannot go into detail. Zombies was great as always and Regular Multiplayer felt solid but the Maps were not the best.[ 7 out of 10 ]Performance:The Game runs easily on High End PC and runs decently on Mid Range ones ( Tested with AMD FX6300 & GTX 760 )it even runs on Low End ones with a little tweaking. ( Tested with Intel i3 & 750ti ( not my rig)).I doubt that you can run it on Laptop (Other than High End ones). But a lot more stable when compared to CoD: IW[ 7 out of 10  ]Price:The Game is not the cheapest and i doubt that the price is going to fall anytime soon.DLC:-Recommended!

The HQ is the best part of the game i think because its fun and stupid at the same time cuz of the glitched animations and the 1v1's. The maps are well made smooth and open as a vetrin of call of duty i can say that WW2 is the smoothes of all i think its even better then the original modern warfare.

												I cannot recommend this game at its current state. I don't care for the campaign, I've never been a COD campagin player... I've always enjoyed the multiplayer and I feel that theres some balancing issues they need to address. For example:SMG--The maps favor SMG playstyle. Yes, I understand they have maps with ""lanes"" but some of these SMG's (which shoot much faster than rifles) end up out playing rifle players in these ""lanes"". 4 Hit makers at the longer range kills. Almost INSTA death at close range due to the firerates.Sniper rifles--The quick scoping in this game is absurd. I DO NOT hate on this skill... These players are without a doubt good. Unfortunately, in this COD the sniper rifles have a very forgiving hit box. I feel that these bullets literally gravitate to the players. I've seen many kill cams where the crosshairs are CLEARLY not on the person and yet the shot registers a ""headshot?"" I've seen this many times over. Its not luck.... its an ISSUE. We have players running around, rushing, flanking, quick scoping EASY kills.Rifles--The semiautomatic rifles in this game is a joke... Period. 2 out of the 3 semi-auto rifles state ""will kill in 2 shots"" the other kills in 3. On paper that sounds GREAT but the fire-rate on all the other guns will out do your 2 clicks for the most part. The automatic rifles have magazine sizes of 20 and 32 with extended mag (for the most part, i believe the STG has 45?) I feel that 20 is on the lowside.... When SMGs with extended mags are rocking 50+. The auto-rifles take 3 hit markers to register a kill. SMGS take 4.LMG--Overall my experience on these seem pretty fair. My only issue is the magazine sizes for these LMGs are 30.... But when you get an extended it jumps to 100??? Lol...The reload rate on an LMG is slow (obviously, like most games they are) but with a magazine size of 30? Thats a joke. Froces players to pick extended mags.Pistols--IF you like semi-automatic guns... Just run around with pistols!!!! They're better than the semi-automatic rifles! Literally, 2 hit markers at close-medium range=death. THE SAME DMG registration that the semi-automatic rifles have.Bazooka--JOKE. This ""rocket laucher"" playstyle does NOT exist lol."

												Call Of Duty is the latest installment in the COD franchise and has brought call of duty back to it's roots.Pros: - Without spoiling anything the campaign covers all aspects of war, from how a soldier overcomes D-Day to Finding the horror of concentration camps. It is truly the most impactful, gritty heart felt campaign in Call Of Duty.- The Campaign has new features to make you feel like you are fighting along side your teammates by adding new features such as Medkits and medics who throw medkits to you when you request them, same as ammo etc.- The Graphics are beautiful, they fully immerse you into the horrors of World War 2.- The Multiplayer is familiar yet revamped, now away from exo suits the boots on the ground gameplay is fast paced, immersive and balanced.- The level design is spectacular, truly pushing the limits of their In-House engine with breath-taking scenery and visuals.- The voice acting and mocap is spot on and the characters feel very real and deliever emotion like nothing scene before in Call Of Duty.- This Call Of Duty add a new NAZI ZOMBIES mode to its gamemodes comepletely giving it a Left4Dead 1 and 2 vibe while keeping a core creepyness compared to that of Treyarch's Zombies and Infinite Warfare's Zombies. If you liked WaW Nazi Zombies you will like this mode.- War mode and HeadQuarters! "" all new modes to Call Of Duty MP, HQ is an area for all players to interact which each other, maybe challenege each other at the firing range or maybe go head to head in the 1v1 pit. The War mode is a objective based gamemode that is similar to Territory in the Rising Storm/Red Orchestra series which involves either defending or attacking on 3 segments of territory until either the enemy is defeated or the enemy has been overrun.- The Supply Drops system involves doing contracts that earn you credits which you can then unlock parts of a kit you want for a specific gun or buy contracts to get you a supply drop which gives you a random chance at getting items.- Supply drops are cosmetic only (as of now 4/11/17)Cons:- The mocap can be a little off sometimes due to having a higher fov than consoles (which is what i presume the mocap was done based on)- The campaign while fulfilling and being around 6 - 8 hours long, i do think it could of been longer with more story details as they jumped ahead in time in a few missions skipping over smaller details.- The Multiplayer has had a few server is issues at launch, like friends not being able to join eachothers party and occasional server lag when ingame.- There is not many weapons in the game which i presume will be so they can add weapons into supply drops :/- Game has Supply Drops (Loot boxes that will eventually  be able to be bought :3)- Still havent expanded on SP DLC other than the typical 4 mp maps and 1 zombies :/- Carentan (a Classic COD map) is behind a paywall, the only way to get it is by owning the season pass. (which i do so eat it suckas)Other than that, i love this game, the SP is a playable movie, the mp is solid and the zombies is a nice new take on the typical zombies.Get it :D"

												Great game that runs buttery smooth on my machine on high settings. GTX 970 i7-3770 16gb DDR3. The one thing I am annoyed about in this game is the no support for aim assist on controllers. I realize the aim assist was strong, but given the fact that there is no aim assist at all on the controllers in this game, it makes for a very unfair field while playing on the couch, or sitting back in a chair. Now, while I do realize the importance of KB+M, realize I've played games like Rust with KB+M for about 2000+ hours. I simply like to sit back and enjoy using a controller sometimes, especailly the cod games. With that being said, I hope there are future updates that improve on the functionality of the Xbox One Controller and other controllers and so on. Other than that, I am satisifed."

												Ok so first off, in my opinion, as a fan of Cod from the original to modern warfare 1-2, but also one that personally disliked the Black Ops series and completely ignored Infinite Warfare, I have to say that this is refreshing. CoD went back to its roots, it's VERY bloody roots, and while there are some glithes here and there (TBH no more then the rest of the games have had) it is still a great game, new modes in multiplayer and a different approch to Zombies is very welcome. I would deffinently recommend CoD:WWII simply because of the fact there are those of us who have been playing the came since the first few in the early 2000's."

The HQ is the best part of the game i think because its fun and stupid at the same time cuz of the glitched animations and the 1v1's. The maps are well made smooth and open as a vetrin of call of duty i can say that WW2 is the smoothes of all i think its even better then the original modern warfare. All and all its a really good game and i recommend it for any one who want to try a good c.o.d game."

												I cannot recommend this game at its current state. I don't care for the campaign, I've never been a COD campagin player... I've always enjoyed the multiplayer and I feel that theres some balancing issues they need to address. For example:SMG--The maps favor SMG playstyle. Yes, I understand they have maps with ""lanes"" but some of these SMG's (which shoot much faster than rifles) end up out playing rifle players in these ""lanes"". 4 Hit makers at the longer range kills. Almost INSTA death at close range due to the firerates.Sniper rifles--The quick scoping in this game is absurd. I DO NOT hate on this skill... These players are without a doubt good. Unfortunately, in this COD the sniper rifles have a very forgiving hit box. I feel that these bullets literally gravitate to the players. I've seen many kill cams where the crosshairs are CLEARLY not on the person and yet the shot registers a ""headshot?"" I've seen this many times over. Its not luck.... its an ISSUE. We have players running around, rushing, flanking, quick scoping EASY kills.Rifles--The semiautomatic rifles in this game is a joke... Period. 2 out of the 3 semi-auto rifles state ""will kill in 2 shots"" the other kills in 3. On paper that sounds GREAT but the fire-rate on all the other guns will out do your 2 clicks for the most part. The automatic rifles have magazine sizes of 20 and 32 with extended mag (for the most part, i believe the STG has 45?) I feel that 20 is on the lowside.... When SMGs with extended mags are rocking 50+. The auto-rifles take 3 hit markers to register a kill. SMGS take 4.LMG--Overall my experience on these seem pretty fair. My only issue is the magazine sizes for these LMGs are 30.... But when you get an extended it jumps to 100???

												The campaign is pretty good to me. The story has character, moreso than other games in this series. If you can get past some slight over the top action and some slight historical innacuricies (I know I buthcered that word) than you will probably at least have the campaign keep your attention until its over for one playthrough. The multiplayer, the reason everyone plays the gameIt's....not bad. The guns feel great and the KB/M really helps it be skill over TTK. Now, some of the modes are more populated then others. TDM and DOM are gonna have you getting in matches faster than other modes like CTF and gridiron. The hardcore playlist is a little annoying to me as there is close to no punishment for TKing you teammates constantly. You don't get kicked yet and that needs to be fixed. The multiplayer is fun beside some balancing issues and some maps catering to very specific playstyles leaving some people in the dust beacause they can't or won't adapt. If you like a mindless multiplayer where you can have fun with friends or just chill with music and a beer. You're going to like the MP. At least when your not that salty over the game kinda fighing back unless you do what it wants. Zombies is not bad. It's a little more Objective focused that I would've hoped but it's still fun. I miss classic zombies and black ops zombies. It's getting a tad complicated now but if you have a full party it can be fun. Overall, the game is fun. It's COD. It has some problems like all games do at launch but as they get fixed and the game becomes more stable I hope that the community here stays. What we have is a good base, it just needs to be built on and stabilized for it to really get into it's stride and become something special."

												All these negative nancies reviewing this game are comical.  I’m actually getting a kick out of some of these.To be honest COD good job with this game.  Probably one of the most addicting CODs I have played in a long time.  Let’s get this straight, I am an Xbox One guy and I see a lot of people complaining about the servers here on PC, I don’t see how there bad??  I can’t even play on Xbox servers and it’s been 3 days since release, I haven’t had 1 issue yet on PC.The graphics are honestly so beautiful!! I tried playing this game on Xbox but it just hurts my eyes now.  Everything is just so choppy on Xbox.  Honestly if there wasn’t so many negative nancies on Steam, I guaranteed this game could be a big hit.  Yeah this game is definitely more competitive on PC than console but why write a bad review for it? Makes no sense sorry that you’re not good at FPS.The destiny tower idea you guys added called “Headquarters” is brilliant.  I love how there is so much customization and a 1v1 arena pretty cool! You guys knocked that out of the park!The only negative thing I have so far about this game, is nerf the SMGs on online play.  People bought this game hoping for like a World at War experience with assault rifle and sniper battles and who has the better shot.  But it’s hard to do that with the SMGs so powerful.  Kind of stuck to the old roots with that, making bad kids sort of good at a FPS game.If you are stuck on the fence about getting this game give it a shot you won’t regret it!Great job COD: WWII"

												Okay, so I think that this game is actually good. It has flaws, but I think it is still good.Lets first get some things out of the way. Yes it is not historically acurate. The nazi soldiers may occasionally drop ppsh's, but the other reviewers can't lie, people would be upset if they couldn't use a ppsh. Yes, you can create an african american soldier in multiplayer. But sledgehammer made this a feature so that people can play the multiplayer with customization. It IS NOT in single player. Single player was made in the attempt to be as historically accurate as possible. Sometimes mistakes were made. Swatstikas were removed in multiplayer so that countries like Germany can play without being blocked off to German servers only. (swatstikas are illegal in video games there). Okay, we good? good.CAMPAIGNThe campaign is very fun to me. It may be short compared to other games like wolfenstien, but it's a COD game. Cmon.The graphics are very well done, and it still suprises me how realistic these games are becoming compared to older generations. There were times where cutscenes looked like A-list movie CGI.The missions are typical, shooting nazis and destroying stuff. I knew what I was getting into. I don't care that it's not WaW, because all I really want is to shoot Nazis in 1080p with a ppsh or M1 Garand.People say it is boring, but its still interesting to me. I think people exzaggerate that the characters are forgettable. Your platoon is more memorable than in WaW. You got memeboi Zussman, hardass Pierson, Turner, Glasses the photogropher, and AEIOU, the other guy. MULTIPLAYERIts COD multiplayer. The base thing is cooler than just a menu, War mode is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, and Zombies makes me want to cry.I didn't like loot boxes until I started out with 5, and now I really don't care.SO, TL;DR. COD WW2 really isn't bad, it still beats battlefield 1 in the close combat department, looks better than Mass Effect Andromida, does its best in historical accuracy, and is overall a fun game.I think people are upset with the price. This is the first game I have ever paid $60 on since Lego Pirates of the Carribean on the Wii in 2011, and I don't think my money was misplaced. I payed $60 for a beatiful looking Cod game set in ww2, and to be able to play the multiplayer while it's still fresh. I don't mind it. I'll probably just♥♥♥♥♥wolfenstien 2 if I get bored in 4 months.So buy it if you want, I reccommend it. It's not as bad as everyone says, just don't expect it to be the next Half-Life or anything.

												I just wanted to voice my frustration to the choices that the developers have made to the gameplay. My biggest frustrations can be compiled under two major topics:1- The ease of using the sniper rifles2- The notorious incompetence of this development team to prevent the cheaters to humiliate them with each and every given opportunityI can understand that no team is perfect. They may have failed to hire the right people and they may suck miserably when it comes to coding secure networking for the game. But, if this team can not prevent people breaking into the network packages and develop their cheats, why are they leaving such a powerful weapon to be used beyond its' realistic ease of use in the game? Don't they understand that, if these sniper rifles have a longer 'settlement' time, the cheaters will not be able to use them as they are being used today? Longer settlement times will render these weapons useless as it would be impossible for a cheater to kill an enemy with a single shot, halfway looking through the scope. I wonder if these developers examine the gameplay of a cheater. Most of the cheaters score a successful shot, halfway looking through the scope. If the settlement time of these weapons were longer, this extra time would give at least a fighting chance to the non-cheaters to deal with the cheaters, and the non-cheaters can start enjoying the game, even if they know - in the back of their minds - that this development team may never solve the cheating issue. I hope the developers stop supporting the cheaters by making the sniper rifles harder to use, because obiously writing a secure networking code is beyond their competence.P.S: I am writing this review after 6+ hours of game time. You should tell Steam to keep decent track of which game was played and how long."

												When i started played COD in 2008 i played through an bought every single one (on console) and noticed a slight but clear drop in quality around when ghost had realesed, make no mistake, i enjoyed Ghosts thoroughly but it did seem a bit off (maybe i was biased because i was a huge fan of the Zombies mode, multiplayer didn't really suit my fancy) when AW rolled around i digged the new movement system and the zombies mode was kinda fun, especially with the exo-movement, which also led me to multiplayer, in which i got an ""OP"" weapon from a supply drop, and noticed that it did seem a bit unfair to use, and i say that because first of all i know a lot of the veteran players didn't bother trying AW but also that compared to other weapons, even other variants it felt too OP, but when BO3 stroleed in, i was in love. The Treyarch games had always been my favorites, a bit biased i guess, but i entered it with hope. The Multiplayer felt like it'd be a new dawn for COD, yet that feeling faded over time as i noticed it plagued with all that people complain cod always had, and the campaign was less than stellar, if not for the Zombies i would've quit that game the year of release. It was only because of intrigue, friends, and a passion for Zombies that I stayed with this game. Man did this game have a great run, it fealt even better with the release of DLC 5 which for me and a few of my friends, reinvigorated the game, but even that couldn't keep me going for the next game, I did'nt buy IW, i did try it, in demo's, at a friend's house, and even game-sharing, but I just didn't feel it, the friend only played the game for about bit, because he bought it only for MWR which he stopped playing after 2 or 3 months. When i heard about WW2, i was hopeful and thought i'd just sit it out and whatch it either go on and prosper or go down in flames, i.e. IW, ghost, or AW, maybe even BO3. But on the day of release, since their had been plently of gameplay to watch prior to its release, i decided to strap in and go in for the ride, the campaign, the first thing i tried, ate up and spit out my PC, i tuned things a bit and it ran smooth, but I left before i finished the first mission, as even though i loved the way it looked, and D-Day looked pretty, in a gritty sort of way, I felt a significant amount of hand-holding throughout the level, and moved to the meat of my ribs, the Zombies mode, which was repeatadly said to be earie, when i started it up i did feel a bit scared, partly because of the foretold eeriness and partly because it was solo, and i always felt a tad frightened while playing solo. as i played through it for about five minutes, i decided that since none of my friends whom which i played on the PS4 with had baught the game on PC or at all. So I took for the public matches, and after a few dropped games and botched connections, I found a game that didn't immediatly drop, i was host which was new for me since i only used and ethernet connection on PC so my connection in the past had much to be desired, and this being my first real match i and another much wandered aimlessely, loosely knowing what to do and just surviving while helping out where we could, we got pretty far in the casual easter egg, but due to an unforeseen event i had to quit, the host was migrated and I never saw them again, after a few more matches, not all, or any that fruitful, let's just say i had a pain in my shoulders from all the carrying I had been doing, this was over a span of a week and ahalf or so, being busy with school and swim had taken up priority and along with it my free time, but anyways i eventually beat the casual easter egg with a random after the other two randoms left so it was just the two of for the second half of the game, yet when i finished it, i didn't have the same fealing of seeing Richtofen swoop in and steal the Summoning key, or blowing up the Moon/Earth, Ending the MOB cycle, freeing Samantha, seeing the childrens room for the first time after Origins, or seeing Richtofen, Dempsey,Takeo, and Nikolai being sacrificed for a greater good, then strapping in for Revelations, only for the cycle to be repeated and the loop starting over. So I don't think that not liking a game series that you happen to like even if theyr'e being biased, just becasue they like different games, i moved on from COD to pastures new,I saw an endless amount of games and genres before me, i saw how Micro-transactions had ruinded once great games, something EA had done time and time again, something I saw Activision turning had been slipping in, at first just a stcker in my shoe, a minor change, not someting too different to get worked up about, but soon after the success of micro transactions i saw that the once simple almost harmless sticker in my shoe had turned into a poison that slowly killed off things i very much loved. Not just the micro-transactions but games atoning to the likes of more ""tolerant"" public views, not a very big problem but something that didn't seem right, just as Ghostbusters had gone into, i feared the same would be come of this series and many others. And the developers, though i respect them, claiming this game to be a work of passion, a work that was to bring the series back to its gritty WW2 setting it had so long ago, but what they had failed to see was that what was first thought to be merely a hate of setting of the games, had actually been a cry, a cry from fans who wanted nothing more, or rather didn't want to see their beloved franchise be runinto the ground, and placed 6-feet under, as they partially dug the hole, dug it with selfishness, and only after the gravestone had been placed did they see they wanted it to come back to them, not someone wearing its old clothes, no, but a ressurection of it, or even a reincarnation. But i believe that if this where to ever happen, the people who mourned for it will surely be long gone, once no longer wanting to have to settle, but now just want to leave, to find a different way to escape. (Going to recommend it because i want this series to surpass its current self and change direction, to turn away from what it's become)"

												This game would be a slam-dunk if they just worked on it a bit longer.  The gameplay is fantastic, the core concept is great, and the game runs amazingly for a modern CoD on PC (no weird lags, no bad ports, nothing).  The problem is two-fold: this game lacks content (9 ""meh"" maps and only a few guns, seriously?  9 maps??) and there is no real defense against cheaters.  While rare, the people with walls and/or aimbot can singlehandedly destroy an entire lobby and sometimes game mode if few people are playing it.If they remedied these 2 things, this game would be a hit; easily an 8+.  As it stands now, it's a 5.75/10 and does not justify a $60 pricetag.  I recommend it more than I do not, but that's not saying much.  Buy it on sale and enjoy.  Do not throw $60 out for this game and definitely do not buy the season pass."

												All I see from the reviews is people complaining about the inaccuracies in the game. It's a video game. I didn't know you were watching the History Channel. The campaign was really fun and I enjoyed it a lot. Action packed and in some missions, it was hard. I didn't like the controls for the tank and plane mission. Those were just awful. Besides that, the campaign is amazing.I enjoy the multiplayer a lot. It is the same old Call of Duty but without any jet packs. Some of the guns are very overpowered in my opinion. Like the snipers. But I still have a lot of fun with the game. The maps are okay, not the greatest but they're not bad. Only map I do hate is the train one. That is a sniping fest. This is the first CoD i bought in a while and I'm glad I did. I don't get why people are giving this game hate because of historical inaccuracies. I think they're just trying to find ways to hate on this game."

												Gonna break it down from SP to MPSpecs: i5 6th genAMD RX 480 8gb8GB RAMWindows 10SP:. Great story that shows the struggles of the war and the brotherhood type pack between your soldiers. It may not be entirely accurate but, for what it is it's pretty damn good and an overall fun and enjoyable playthrough. Roughly lasted about 10 hours depending on difficulty this can flucuate the legnth. Great set pieces as well as a mixture of missions ranging in a variety of locations made the overall experience feel not stale. Toss in a emotional story of the hardships of the war its really felt at times like a grade A movie. My overall experience has left me rating the SP portion a 8/10.MP:This may be the main reason why people play CoD and expectations are high ever since announcement of returning to boots on the ground. I can say its actually one of the best CoD MP experiences in a long time but, it is not near the overall best. It features a good robust ammount of guns but, there are the stand out guns  that feel as if they are the strongest and best choice. Good attachment varieties with the usual camo challenges that help keep the grind for unlocks going. As always you have your prestige classes and prestige unlocks. I like the new feature of different classes like mountain to infantry and how each class has their own little niche. The game modes feature the usual classics that people love with a new addition called War which is a scenario break down pvp mode that also includes bots. Its fun with friends but, not the best mode overall. The overall experience feels optimized and runs very smooth with FPS ranging for me in the 120-135's. My main issue is how the map layout and designs are. Some maps are great but, majority feature very close quarter 3 lane layout that maps sniping feel quickscope focused and less range. However overall the general feel of the MP is good. I rate the MP porition a 7/10 for great effort bringing back boots on the ground however still lacking in some departments like maps."

Servers should be up, I understand that but 2 hours out of your day for servers being down and .7 hours on a game doesn’t warrant a bad review you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 2. If the games runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥it’s probably because what you are trying to run it on is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Once again, it’s 2017, get a good enough pc and stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing about a game not running at 100% optimal settings. This also leads into the next point. If you do not put the time into a game to review it, don’t even review it at all. I only have 4 hours (check profile) but I felt it needed to be addressed because I see these kids with an hour or less complaining about plot when the first campaign mission probably takes that much time. How the ♥♥♥♥ can you honestly tell me you know the plot from one mission?? I think this game is fine, and every game needs feedback but complaining about realism in an arcade shooter is ridiculous. Go complain about something else and sue McDonalds for having too hot of coffee you little ♥♥♥♥ing snowflakes."

												Well, best game story in WW2."
"Posted: November 10, 2017",Recommended,6.7 hrs on record,"Posted: November 10, 2017
												Intro - This game offers (potentially) hundreds upon hundreds of hours of content, and objectively, it's all done incredibly well. The majority of the reviews are from people who jump into this game specifically looking for things to nit-pick and whine about - aka children. The port is flawless, those who saw otherwise are still running Q6600s and 660tis with 8gb of ram. So assuming you have relatively newer hardware, you'll be absolutely fine. With that out of the way, lets jump into this.CampaignI'll admit, I was pretty unimpressed with the campaign. Every COD campaign has at least 1 or 2 'jaw dropping' set piece moments in it's usual 'action movie' forumla. This one unfortunately, didn't have one of those large scale moments. However, it does have some positives.First, there's a really fun mission where you control a plane and basically free fly around your fleet taking out about 20 bad dude planes. It doesn't last very long, which sucks, but it's definitely a fun moment.Second, the graphics are pretty damn impressive. The facial animation and mapping turned out flawless. It's pretty incredible to see in engine faces look indistinguishable from real life. Honestly, the best I've seen. Yes, games like Battlefield do it great, but they all fall into the uncanny valley and your brain iinstantly recognizes them as not real, so they come across creepy. This game however, does not.And third, the relationship between your main character and Zussman is awesome. The negatives everyone will notice, is it's incredibly short. It took me 6 hours to clear it, and I died probably about 10 times. You could do it in one sitting in about 4 hours if you really wanted to. Also, the other characters are poorly acted, which is a dissapointment considering who's in it.ZombiesOh zombies, finally someone came along and took the stage from Treyarch. Treyarch's been doing dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥like throwing electric ghost men and aliens into their own franchise, which has made it terrible. Zombies hasn't been enjoyable since Black Ops 1. SHG however removed all the goofyness and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and finally give us back the creep and horror. The design is amazing. The lighting, fog, and atmosphere really put you on edge (especially when playing solo). I don't want to go into too much detail, but it's fun and I definitely suggest it to those who've been playing since WAW.MultiplayerMultiplayer removes the old create-a-class system and gives us Divisions. There are 5 key divisions with weapon specialties that grant a sort of perk if using the weapon the division specializes in, which in turn, means you're penalized for using a weapon outside of the speciality. Personally, I love the system. Since Black Ops 2, I've fallen into the habit of having 10 classes with the exact same set up of 4 perks, and 2 attachments, but with different weapons. It takes away from experiencing a variety of different play styles. It's nice that there aren't 4 guys running around with ghost every damn game, it feels more balanced. The score streaks finally do something, which they've been lacking the passed couple years, and the weapons all have their own feel and characteristics - they don't just feel like a skin of one gun in it's class. There are supply drops, but they come much much more often and don't contain game changing varients or weapons. Although I'm pretty sure they will throw some in there eventually (guns, not varients). But, the quartermaster system is close to MWR, meaning you can work to unlock them yourself. Although, I prefer they pull and IW and give them to season pass owners. Anyways, we'll just have to wait and see. But as of right now, the system doesn't seem like it's going to be anywhere near as awful as Black Ops 3.Headquarters - finally we get some sort of open world centeral hub where (up to) 48 players can all just hang out, 1v1, recieve orders and contracts, shoot at the shooting range, and watch each other open drops. It's actually really unique, and I've spent a good amount of time there myself.All in all, there's no BS specialists, no 'free streaks' for bad players, and it's boots on the ground. I definitely can't complain.SummaryIt's a World War II first person shooter, and it's done incredibly well. It censors multiplayer to allow those in other countries to actually play, and allows for playing of genders and races you don't see in the actual conflict for everyone to enjoy some customization. And honestly, that's perfectly fine. If you want swastikas, play the campaign. The multiplayer isn't a hardcore simulation, it's a fast paced, run and gun, arcade style Call of Duty like the franchise has been doing for the passed 11+ years. So if you wanna ♥♥♥♥♥ about that, go ahead, but it's clear what this game is and how it will play. If you actually expect otherwise, it's you who's the idiot, not those who enjoy the gameplay. I 100% recommend this game, and don't let all these negative reviews steer you away from having fun. It's a seriously good game, and hope to see you online. One might say, see you on the Battlefield ;DCan I say that?"

												Can't possibly get my head around all the bad reviews. Some people will always be set in their ways and decide, regardless of anything, when they don't like it, they don't it. This Call of Duty is amazing. Finally got back to the game I loved so much back in the day. The campaign was, while a bit short, great fun and interesting with an incredible story line. The Nazi Zombies is probably the easiest it's ever been but loved it all the same. But despite all that, my favourite part, and I can't stress this enough, is how good I am online again. Clearly the 13 years old of today can't compete with the 13 year olds of our generation. Without the ability to double jump, climb walls and plasma weapons, they just can't compete. This game is better than it has been for a long time.Call of Duty... Welcome back."

I don't have any lags, long waiting time or bad servers, besides you dont have to use money to get stuft, you get coins from every match and you can do mission to get more xo or lootcrates, where you can get skins for guns or your avatar. This campaign is the best one i have played of all of the COD games, so much drama and so many different way to play a mission. So many new things. This game is not a waste of time or money. Oh yeah, how could i forget the zombie game, so far only 2 maps and one of them is really cool and big, new zombies, new miniboss and big boss who can retk you in 2 secs, one of the best things is you do not only take 2 hits from a zombie to die like in Black ops.If you got a few friends who want this, then do it i guess i dont control your money"

												Wonderful game! The multiplayer is a real blast. War mode is just what the players needed in all these call of duty years. It makes the action feel more realistic and it is more objective orientated so teamwork is now more an option. The customization options are numerous. Also the new Create a Division gives a more diverse playstyle and makes the game more interesting. The singleplayer is good as ever, with dramatic scenes and a lot of action. In conclusion, COD:WWII is a fantastic sequel in the call of duty series for cod players. If you're not a fan, this game deserves to be tried."

This game just was not ready to launch lol.It looks like its gona be a great game once they get these launch bugs fixed.Or if you dont mind solo playing for a while.Multiplayer is really boring.If you cant quick-scope, dont play multi. Youll just feed. With the hitbox ghosting, quickscope is everyone godlike. No other choice.I do like the fact that they tried to balance out sniper camp fests with close-quarters stuff but... It feels like a miss. You can use snipers cause of quickscoping in close quarters so there really so no point.Nobody cheating, just, the game doesnt work right when quickscoping yet and it lets you get shots that should completely miss."

												another great story telling in a Call of Duty franchise of which I am a great fan :)I have not played MP at the moment, I just finished SP in something less than 8 hours on hardened difficulty.game brings new system where you're not being healed automatically by taking a cover instead you need to find a medkit and hit a button to patch yourself. new squad system opens a new level of getting support from your 'brothers in arms' like grenades, medkits, enemies location, air support etc. I kinda liked it, the key bindings on those are horrible though. pressing '6' for medkit or 'N' to ask for a pack of ammo is just completely out of your reach at the action you're gonna live in.the cutscenes are probably one of the best I've ever seen in any game so far, few times I found myself not believing I'm not watching a real actors in a short movie. Excellent I won't forget on few scenes thanks to this.I find myself disappointed by the fact it's all aimed on an american guys fighting his way thru the Europen theater of war though. Yeah. I am from EU so Americanism is making me sick sometimes because of all those heroes and soldier that died for their countries and this game forgots to show its homage to them (except of the last line in ending credits).Still, story is what it is, not very complicated, predictable (hell, actually you're not going to predict anything, you're just fighting your way out!) but it serves the game just fine. Sarge is definitely taken (or at least inspired) from the (ah hail the king!) movie Platoon, but it's missing more courage and charisma maybe. But he's great!If you're a Call of Duty fan, you're going to have a great time, believe me, just play and enjoy, nothing more. Visuals are outstanding, jaw dropping sometimes, it's just great and makes the whole enjoyment exciting and great.Honestly, I will buy it and play it again on my console(s), it's that much worth it to me. Yep. That's it boys! Helluva game it is ..."

This is how I rate the game in my persnol opinion:Campaign: 9/10Pros: - The most of the characters are well fleshed out and you enjoy fighting through the war with them.- The new ammo and health pack system in a perfect edition to the gameplay.- The story is well written and well acted.Cons:- Not all characters I well fleshed out, including your own character.- The campaign is a bit to short being able to be completed in 6 hours.- The tank mission controls TERRIBLY on PC.Multiplayer: 9/10Pros:- The multiplayer is addicting and fun to play.- Best since Black Ops II.- The supply drops dont feel pay to win.- The contracts bring more replay ability.- Headquaters....just headquaters.Cons:- Supply Drops- Servers are funtioning at 90% and not 100% (at release)- Women in multiplayer ruins the immersion (I'm a history guy)- Black Women NazisZombies: 10/10Pros:- Fun gameplay.- Fun easter egg.- It's actually scary.- David ♥♥♥♥ing Tennant- A new and great class syestem with different powers and perks.Cons:- Can be very HARD not great for new players.- The new armor system is a bit much for new players.For a Call of Duty Fan: 9/10For a non Call of Duty Fan: 7/10"

												I understand that there's lots of people complaining about the campaign. I think the devs want it to be 50% historical and 50% made up by their ideas. I'm just finding this game fun to play, ofc there might be bugs and online problems but that's propably goin to get fixed, bcz this game just got released 2 days ago.I would rather say i'm happy this isnt made by ubisoft."

												Okay here we go. So some history: I've played CoD since the original on PC. I've enjoyed the games up until MW (yeah I know everyone loves it, but I sincerely think it's the worst in the series to this day), and has more came out, my faith in the series went down. I did enjoy IW (campaign. MP was meh.) , and when I saw they were going back to WWII I was excited. Now they promoted this and said it to be historically accurate. Well, the campaign isn't (German's using PPSH's on D-Day, uniforms are wrong) and the characters aren't memorable. But overall, it's gritty and fun. Zombies is definitely the best since they were first introduced in WaW.Now to MP: Maps are tiny, but chaotic. I am very glad perks were taken out (felt like they held your hand). The guns though handle very awkwardly, but you get use to it. Back to the historical accuracy: there seems to be almost more WWI than WWII weapons in this gmae. Also some of these weapons were prototypes and never saw combat (the 1914 for example). I thought it was weird, but whatever. But with that, the character models (everyone knows what I'm talking about so I don't need to go into detail), and terrible voice acting, the immersion of the setting gets lost in MP.So why am I giving this a positive review? Well if you go in thinking it's going to be historically accurate (as the devs claim) like the old games you're not going to have fun. But if you view (at least the multiplayer) as an arcady, alternate WWII setting, you'll have fun. It's not the best gameplay, but it's a major improvement over MW. I guess you just need to accept that they won't ever make a good one like CoD 2, but at least they are trying."

												After I get some more playtime I will edit this review and asses the game completely; from what I can tell right now though, the game is actually fun and the port is much better compared to the previous PC Ports. My Computer’s hardware isn’t the best and is kind of low tier but the game still runs beautifully and looks great too. A good step in the right direction. Don’t listen to other negative reviews just bashing because of the rough server start, look for actual criticism."

TOOK SWASTIKA OUT OF MULTIPLAYER TO NOT OFFEND SNOWFLAKES!!, You get like 4 maps LOL, gun selection sparce, connectivity issues (on PC havent been bad and are getting better), and spawn points can be camped very easily like previous games.I think if you liked the previous games you will love this one another great title and overall worth my $60."

												Wonderful game! The multiplayer is a real blast. War mode is just what the players needed in all these call of duty years. It makes the action feel more realistic and it is more objective orientated so teamwork is now more an option. The customization options are numerous. Also the new Create a Division gives a more diverse playstyle and makes the game more interesting. The singleplayer is good as ever, with dramatic scenes and a lot of action. In conclusion, COD:WWII is a fantastic sequel in the call of duty series for cod players. If you're not a fan, this game deserves to be tried."

												Can't possibly get my head around all the bad reviews. Some people will always be set in their ways and decide, regardless of anything, when they don't like it, they don't it. This Call of Duty is amazing. Finally got back to the game I loved so much back in the day. The campaign was, while a bit short, great fun and interesting with an incredible story line. The Nazi Zombies is probably the easiest it's ever been but loved it all the same. But despite all that, my favourite part, and I can't stress this enough, is how good I am online again. Clearly the 13 years old of today can't compete with the 13 year olds of our generation. Without the ability to double jump, climb walls and plasma weapons, they just can't compete. This game is better than it has been for a long time.Call of Duty... Welcome back."

												Don't listen to those COD haters. This game is really awesome and fun. I don't have any lags, long waiting time or bad servers, besides you dont have to use money to get stuft, you get coins from every match and you can do mission to get more xo or lootcrates, where you can get skins for guns or your avatar. This campaign is the best one i have played of all of the COD games, so much drama and so many different way to play a mission. So many new things. This game is not a waste of time or money. Oh yeah, how could i forget the zombie game, so far only 2 maps and one of them is really cool and big, new zombies, new miniboss and big boss who can retk you in 2 secs, one of the best things is you do not only take 2 hits from a zombie to die like in Black ops.If you got a few friends who want this, then do it i guess i dont control your money"

As someone who doesnt really care much for the campagn and zombies, I don't really mind if its historically accurate or not, as long as it's somewhat thematically correct which it as at the least. In terms of performance I can run the game just fine enough for me but it still ranges between 90-144 Fps depending on where you are and whats happening and I typically turn shadows down to normal and other post processing effects off to improve visibility.

The 1vs1 fighting pit is great to play and even more fun to watch, be cool if you could place bets... but would be too easy to manipulate I suppose.the campaign is fun and the MP feels more like MP of old.Not played Zombies yet.Overall it is a great addition tot he franchise, yet will probably be dead within a few months on PC as always."

												Call of Duty: WWII tells the personal story of soldiers forming a tight bond while also delivering a panoramic view of a war where the cause was good but the fighting was brutal.The squad fights through a dozen horrific battles in the single-player campaign. Each one is like its own nightmare. You crawl up Omaha Beach through withering fire. You drive a jeep through enemy lines. You face an artillery ambush that shatters the trees above you. You learn to stick with your comrades and make the ultimate sacrifices for them. During the battles, you are called upon to do heroic actions, like dragging a fallen soldier to safety, capturing enemies instead of shooting them, or escorting a little girl away from the fighting. Such acts of humanity take place against the backdrop of a war that was brutal in almost every way, from the collateral damage on civilians to the mistrust it bred among the conquered populations.The return to World War II has slowed the pace of multiplayer. You have time to think about your survival, to take your shots, and to hide behind cover when necessary. This is good for players with rusty reflexes.There are also more ways to practice to get better. In the Headquarter social hub, you can play one-on-one challenges and practice how to use Scorestreaks or weapons. All of that means that you’ll have a better experience as you go from noob to a veteran.War Mode stands out in particular because you aren’t just out for the kills anymore. Like Electronic Arts’ Battlefield shooters, War has multiple objectives that you have to take in order to win. Each match has two halves, and you switch sides at halftime. To succeed in this match type, each player must fulfill a crucial role. The emphasis isn’t on the kill-death ratio at all. It’s the best part of multiplayer because it forces players to find and fulfill a role in order to win.I would give this game a solid 8.5/10"

												To me, and this is absolutely just my opinion, this was the best CoD campaign I played so far. I didn't like the confusing modern warfare triology, BO was kinda boring, Infinite Warfare just too sci-fi. But that one: Only a few characters, but they work, I like them, I understand them. The story isn't a mess, it's logical. By far too short, too much ""blockbuster"" but on it's best moments, it's really really good. Suprisingly. I would recommend but if you don't like CoD at all that won't change."

												-The Rant-All the negative reviews are just 13 year old CoD fan boys who are annoyed because they don't have modern weapons, heartbeat sensors, glowing weapon camo's or akimbo shotguns.Also anybody who complains about skill based matchmaking is a cry baby and just wants to be placed in servers with lower skilled players so they can pretend that they are good at the game.-The Review-Positives:Graphics are nice and it runs well.Single player is interesting but not the best CoD has to offer.I'm enjoying multiplayer and the social hub is pretty cool.The new war mode is great, it's nice to not have the enemy constantly spawn behind you for once.First time i've ever seen regular team work and communication in a CoD game.Weapons are mostly well balanced.Killstreaks aren't overpowered.Zombies is fun as always and now has its own rank/class system.Negatives:Russian and Japanese weapons on the western front? (singleplayer).Zombie games can go on for as long as 3+ hours so you end up getting bored and killing yourself.Weapon camo's look like garbage unless applied to specific variants.War mode needs to limit snipers to a maximum of 1-2 per team to encourage objective play.Spawn rotation- Enemies will literally spawn next to you due to the small map sizes.Maps are mostly tiny.Not enough maps.It's only 12 player (6v6).Hackers are present in some servers and can ruin the fun by wall banging every player so they cannot advance on the objective.Quickscoping is still a joke and snipers ruin team play.Singleplayer 6/10This is a fun singleplayer game but CoD: World at War is much better.Multiplayer 8/10This is the 17th game in the CoD series... and for the most part the multiplayer is solid but with a few annoying problems."

												COD is back!My initial impressions so far are great. The campaign is top-notch so far. Great acting, high quality sound and fx.Havn't touched multiplayer yet but there is a enough beta impressions out there to get a good feel at how good it is.The strongest point that stands out for me are the graphical options.Very impressed with the number of options available to the user. Every major option is offered and thoroughly explained in the UI. The one thing that suprised me is that FOV is defaulted at 50 degrees. That shocked me. When I switched to to the max setting of 95 it was like taking the blinders off. I feel sorry for console players if they are stuck with 50 fov.Another shining point that stands out so far is how incredibly optimized this game is. I can actually run this game at an upscaled resolution of 8k at around 20fps with my Titan X system. Pretty impressive that it's even possible with only the recent dice games offering the same option.At 4k I am locked (synched)  at a smooth and solid 60fps with my 4k monitor with max settings (including AA). Well done devs!I hope they still have that multiplayer mojo the COD series is famous for. I will tackle that option after my campaign playthrough.I highly recommend this game. It's a good year for FPS games that's for sure.I will never understand the review hate. To tear this game apart because it isn't 100% accurate with uniforms etc is pathetic. To whine that minority models are used in multiplayer is just sad.This entertainment product did a good job of entertaining as far as I am concerned. It's not perfect but it's still fun and in the end it's a video game."

												Playing this game for the first time, gives you the exact same feeling you got when you played Modern Warfare 2 for the first time. It has the classic Call of Duty style gameplay, with all the WWII aspects. Nazi Zombies is unbelievable it is so detailed and its almost like Treyarch Zombies + Infinity Ward Zombies + L4D2 + Zombie Army Trillogy (of course without the 3rd person aspect). Definitely recommened this game if you're sick and tired of playing futuristic games, and would like a Battlefield 1 type gameplay, but with Call of Duty mechanics. 10/10 - Sledgehammer's best."

												A CoD that is actually playable. Havent had that since Black Ops 2. 11 Hours into the multiplayer i can tell you that this game, at least gameplaywise, doesnt deserve the bad ratings it gets. Some weapons have to, and im confident that they will be, rebalanced (like in every CoD ever...) but overall this game is enjoyable.Im running a GTX1070, i7 7700K (non OC)and have 8gb of 2600mhz RAM. It runs like a dream. No stuttering, no fps drops, just the occasional stillframe. (Happens to me in other games too sometimes so i wouldnt blame this one on CoD)I dont really give a crap about authenticity (playing like a squad of clone trooper n***ers in MP is actually pretty hilarious), fact is I havent had his much fun in a CoD for years and I even look forward to playing it while im at work. This also hasnt been the case for a CoD in years...Long story short: buy it, try it, dont like it? refund it. Easy.Dont let all this (now apparantly mainstream) hate for CoD scare you of. PS: One BIG♥♥♥♥♥Con will be weapons in suply drops that will be released eventually. (unless they balance them properly... yeah right as if they would do that lol)"

												Dont usually write reviews but as its now cool to hate on Call of Duty (somewhat deserving due to the last few games) i feel like i have to.The campaign in this game is fantastic. The cut scenes are great, the story is relatively grounded with the set pieces only just getting a bit ""whacky"" or ""CoD"" like. I expected the usual CoD campaign here and was pleasantly surprised with the pacing, the missions themselves where all fantastic. Stealth sections felt appropriate and didnt end the mission if failed, just changed it up slightly. From the D-Day landings, to taking back paris, to an incredible segment in the battle of the bulge this is one of Call of Duty's BEST single player experience.The multiplayer is more of what you know, and thats not a bad thing. It feels more like black ops than recent iterations. Runs fantastic, the guns feel varied enough and the addition of HQ fleshes out the online considerably.I've yet to touch zombies so cant comment on that, but the campaign and multiplayer sells this game for me already. If you like COD Buy it. If you havent liked COD for the past 2-3 years, give it a go! Like me, it may just surprise you!"

I think need little more bass toneGameplay 8/10 : Hmmm.. where to start?....Big problem, for now, is weapon balance, for example, IW have one of the best balance.. you can go 1v1 almost with any weapon.. here no chance.. hit marker it's also not so pleased... the new movement system is great, annoying at first but when you start using him then is cool.. we need something like that..

												I have been a loyal COD Fan ever since Modern Warfare 1 came out. If you've already seen my Black Ops 3 review, you could tell how much I hated Treyarch's god awful loathsome butchery of crap. I liked Infinite Warfare a lot better despite having an unpopular opinion, but still, it felt more like a ""Big"" conflict than a ""LARGER THAN LIFE"" one. I'm 20 years old as of this Review and have been playing COD's campaigns since MW. The only COD Games I loved playing multiplayer for was MW1 and Black Ops 1. The main complaint I hear all the time is that Call of Duty should strictly be a horribly overused term I like to call ""Boots on the Ground"" or as I like to call it ""MUH BOOTS UN DA GROUND"" COD IMHO was never about being Boots on the Ground, or being World War 2, or being Modern, or being a space opera or being a vietnam/cold war nazi zombie game WHATEVER! The point is, Call Of Duty was always about the WAR AND PEOPLE IN SAID WAR. Lately, I noticed after replaying IW for the second time, IW had good characters, but it didn't feel like the conflict was that big. The game felt more like a Villain of the week Saturday Morning Cartoon. So if you are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how COD Should always be BOOTS UNH DAH GROUND than you missed the entire point of Call of Duty. It was about The War and The Soldiers. Enough Said.Now onto COD WWII. The fourteenth game in the series. I was really excited about playing a COD Game set in WWII and was hoping the game would be Awesome. Thankfully it is great. Not only in the campaign, but in Mutliplayer as well. The game strives in multiplayer and it feels just amazing. The sound design is also fantastic, with grenades sounding the best they ever did in any COD game. Multiplayer is not historically accurate so be prepared to see Female Axis people in the multiplayer game.I've only played two missions so far in COD WWII. I got frustrating a bit when I kept dying due to the awkward quick time events and beginning mission where turrets are shooting at you on Normandy beach. There are some big name stars in the campaign and they look fantastic otherwise. The game features health and medkits, but that problem I had with that was I was using medkits so little because my health was always up to par as I felt more like a super soldier. Kind of ironic. There is also vehicle controls and they do pretty well. Now time for graphics and technical stuff. Graphics are fine I guess especially the characters looking pretty good. Audio cut outs are evident here and I had to just change the graphics a tiny bit to get a good 60 FPS at 2560x1440p. So overall, nothing to bad.But most importantly, The conflict and characters (as I said, the primary focus of COD Games in general) are HUGE. Yeah the European Theater of war is overused to all hell in video games and you are focusing on the Allies like always, but to be honest, I've been craving this ever since I played COD 2. I'll keep looking at reviews to see how it is going, but so far, More positives than Negatives at 65% from last I checked. I hope I didn't push to many buttons with my ""MUH BOOTS"" rant, but that's what happens when I don't talk, I keep it in my for so long then get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at others for bandwagoning.These are just my initial thoughts on the game. I have still yet to dive into Nazi Zombies and will most likely get the Season pass for this game. Great game especially multiplayer being a return to form for Classic COD."

												Recommending the campaign, not the multiplayer.Users basing their reviews solely on the already ill reputation multiplayer aspect of the game should be taken with a grain of salt.I have never bought a Call of Duty game to get caught up on the multiplayer with the not so great community picking it as their pro choice over the better parts. When the naive part of the community buys a Call of Duty game they ignore the existance of a great campaign and tunnel vision on reviewing the anticlimactic and chaotic part of the game. All they care about is zombies this and quickscoping that, something that is getting even older than futuristic games this year. This audience probably would refuse to buy the game had it not included a multiplayer part. A linear simple-minded audience very easy to please. The feminist agenda and political correctness campaign Activision is running will get hammered into your head when playing multiplayer, while they promise a some-what realistic and enjoyable experience in the campaign. Learn to enjoy the well-written campaigns Call of Duty games offer.As the majority of Call of Duty titles, the campaign is outstanding. I'm never going to touch the multiplayer part of the game to avoid getting caught up in the mindblindness on the spectrum with the children only here to find a good daycare center after breaking into their parents' piggy banks. The multiplayer community described in a nutshell."

												Yet another cod that just isn't what they told us it would be. Too many f*ck ups at launch, even though they released a beta to test things out, it feels like we received the alpha version of it. Despite that it does have some good characteristics, even though they are heavily outnumbered. After all, it's cod, it hasn't been truly good since mw3 and it's kind of their image nowadays, to be a game that disappoint people. Despite all my negativity I would still recommend the game, just because it's a cod and it's finally back on the ground as it's supposed to be."

												Pretty decent COD.I got this a few hours after it came out and i have been addicted to it ever since. It feels like your ordinary cod and to me, weirdly enough, it feels kinda like BO2. I've never really played cod on pc but came off of console. From what it seems like, this cod is probably a better cod than the other previous ones on pc. There are lots of snipers and smg rushers but i dont really mind it too much(im a quiksKopEr myself lmao). One bad thing i see in the game is the spawns and some of the maps. The spawns are completelyâĽâĽâĽâĽâĽâĽand the maps are sub par. Other than that i really like the multiplayer and the zombies and could go on talking about this but ima keep it short. id say 8/10 would recommend"

												This game is great! To all the people giving bad reviews, they haven't really played it. Some of the issues people have are historical inaccuracies. Couple things, The nazi arm band were only worn by actual party leaders and party members. Most of the army didn't wear those arm bands. so most of the game is accurate in that sense. Another thing people complain about is Normandy saying it isn't acurate. It totally is. They never actually say the beach is Omaha, which the beach that suffered most of the casualties on that day. Most of the other beaches had minimal casualties. Plus, the actual beach invasion only took about 15 minutes for most of the beaches. Omaha was a little bit longer because they didn't have their armored support (The tide was higher then planned so a lot of the tanks sunk before landing on the beach)Overall gameplay alone is enough to buy this game. But don't buy it because of supposed inaccuracies. It's still an amazing game that honors those who actually fought and died in WWII."

												Zombies was good its what you will be paying for however like only one map you will end up playing lol. PvP wise its SMG and LMG dominate on Normal servers usally.. War is like Sniper only. Hardcore as of right STG is the best and just one shot everyone running around low recoil far range great control. If your decent as CSGO and love super fast pace games even though they should be slower welll you will mostlikely find yourself dominating these players.Single Player was alright my mission is gltich on something like HILL 493 or something sooo I can't complete it.My point of view of what your paying for.Campaign-10 dollars (for me a broken mission I can't finish) VERY VERY MOVIE action based and took many ideas from like every chessy movie that was WW2 and WW2 games that are dated.. Even a BF1 WW1 mission LOL But ehhZombies-35 Zombie camoMutiplayer-15 Get free stuff automatically almost lvl by just logging in lolWould I get it if I was in your steps and you already have FPS shooters like CSGO, BF4, BF1? ehh I would wait till it was like 40 dollars on sale.But if your brand new to PC gaming? And also have the hardware to play it. Then Buy it small group of people play and they are not that great but decent players. I even use a controller and still do pretty decent."

												As you may know call of duty is a grat franchise, BUT has suffered many drawbacks. I personally lost interest in it since ADVANCED WARFARE, and the singleplayer campaign got less and less interesting. Personally i loved the early COD series such as Call Of Duty 1, COD 2, all the way up to COD MW2. This game actually has an INTERESTING CAMPAIGN STORY though it is only like 6 hours long or maybe 8 if you collect all the collectables. It does a descent job in making you feel the characters, Zussman is my favorite. the multiplayer new mode is pretty good (play with friends dont play alone). one of the downsides of this game is it's balance (i hope thay fix that soon). hopefully this review is helpful"

												I have always gotten evey call of duty to date. Past Modern Warfare 3 it didn't really seem that viable but i have renewed my faith with this title. First of all, what I think most people are forgetting is that it's a game. It doesn't bother me that there are female soldiers or that we are fighting in places that didn't have that big of an impact in the war. If you want history read a book, if you want a fun multiplayer shooter, zombies, and campaign look no further. There are some bugs though, hopefully they will be addressed in the near future but so far I do not have that many complaints. War mode is by by my favorite game mode in multiplayer; I haven't beat the campaign yet but its been fun so far; zombies...my god I love it. I did not really like infinite warfare zombies since it did not have that essence of zombies like the previous ones did. This zombies brought some of that essence back, and I really enjoyed it. All in all, I rate this game 4/5. There are some things that need to be worked out but I like playing this because it is a GAME, NOT A HISTORY BOOK. Thumbs up from me!"

												The first Call of Duty game in a few years that's actually fun. Yes the game isn't 100% accurate to what WWII was actually like e.g. German Soldiers using PPSH (Russian SMGs) but that doesn't remove from the fun of the game. Compared to the previous Call of Duty games, e.g. Black Ops 3, Infinite Warfare and Advanced Warfare, this game is actually fun again. Sniping is actually good for the first time in years, SMGs aren't totally broken for the first time in years. The class system is not limited to 10 slots and there are no perks, just unlockable class abilities and a skill e.g. reloading while sprinting. The campaign, although it was short, was immersive and exciting with the health regen being removed anbd replaced with First Aid Kits which were scattered around the levels, or were available from using your squad skill. The stealth element worked well and was fun to play.Overall, this game is not for someone who is looking for complete and utter realism and accuracy to WWII, but for someone who is looking for a fun game with WWII weapons and battles, then this is the game for you.Thoroughly enjoyed the campaign and the multiplayer so far, I'd rate it at an 8.5/10"

												This game is a triumph, overall. An excellent instalment. Great sound, graphics, storyline, and gameplay. The weapon upgrades are fun without being tedious, and I love how players can change the look of their character, which is not new to the series, but fun to see in WWII mode. Some downsides: There's a spawn timer between kills in War mode, which is a major drawback to the game-type. Also the ridiculous kill-cam in standard mode is there for the cry-babies. The payment system, or coins used to purchase items is a little skimpy. A big bug I have noticed is that the skin part of the engine is not very stable. Random skins show up on my toon, and I have had an entire class disappear from my screen. Others have reported problems with missing drop packs, and weapons. I hope this gets sorted out soon. Nice to see a return to the WWII genre, it works well with the FPS gaming. The game has crached a litt on me, but nothing like previous releases.Multipler is rich with different modes and the maps are built well meaning they are not so wide open that players are dispersed, and not so tight that it brings out the lunatic ""tight maps"" run-and-die crowd.If you have been gaming for 30 years like me, and can recall the original CoD release, you'll enjoy this one for sure. Go get it!"

												So, everybody here crying about small things such as nazi's running around with a PPSH? So ♥♥♥♥ing what? This ain't a WWII simulation, this game is made in the same theme, but it is meant to be fun. If you go play military simulation games like Squad or whatever, you'll realise it sucks and is boring as hell, because it is to damn realistic and it's just running around!I think they did a great job in making a change in the franchise. For example the Headquarters, they've put a lot of work in that! Never seen before. And what about the divisions? Sure, maybe you prefer the perks, but you can't always have what you want so deal with it. I agree, the amount of maps in the multiplayer are a bit low, but think about what kind of details there are in the campaign maps, for example Paris! Just beautiful. Now you're probably thinking, yeah but they had 149532 multiplayer maps in a previous COD and there was a campaign aswell. Yes, that is true, but was the campaign made this beautifully made? Were the maps this realistic? I don't think so. Sledgehammer Games took more time for the campaign this year, because we shouldn't forget WWII really happened, they want to show us how it was like, in a story based way. Oh and the War mode. I really like it, again, something never done before, why go hate on it? Atleast this company tries out something new, do we really want to stick with the same old 13 multiplayer maps,♥♥♥♥♥♥campaign and ''oh yeah I also got zombies for my 60 bucks''? Personally I don't think so. We finally get some new things for the 60 bucks, be happy, maybe the new things don't fit your style, but not buying it because the nazi's aren't using the right weapon (again, it's not a ♥♥♥♥ing war simulator) is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Just give this a chance, if you decide you don't like it, just refund it? Make sure you don't play more than 2 hours and I can guarantee you you get your money back.Now, go and buy that game and make this an awesome PC community!#PCMASTERRACE"

												I'm going to be honest, people complain about their computers not being able to run it well but I have a MSI 1060 6GB, a i5-6600, and 16 GB of DDR4 RAM and I run it Ultra with motion blur and depth of view off. I've only played the Multiplayer and Zombies which were both pretty solid, but the D Day map was a tremendous failure on their part, MG-42's will mow you and your entire squad down the entire time. Zombies is interesting in the fact that there are multiple zombie types, and more perks, but I feel the whole experience is sort of watered down by the 'Extra Gun Damage' perk, it sorta makes Pack-a-Punch a little less exciting to get to. Also, sometimes the game does these akward jumpscares where zombies will appear in front of you from seemingly the ether and stop you dead in your tracks, but I feel it's still a solid experience overall for the Multiplayer and Zombie aspects. Some other notes that should be madeCommunity - Still ToxicDivisions - An interesting twist that adds some extra stuff to upgrade your SoldierHQ - Surprisingly a nice little addition, a place to go to accept orders and missions, or just goof aroundGunplay - SMG's seem to be heavily favored along with the STG and MG-42 but there's always fan favorites, pretty solid (as it should be for an FPS) It's aided with the multiple customization options for your gunsOverall verdict, It's pretty good, it definately has it's flaws but if you miss old Call of Duty this might just be the breath of fresh air you need to get you back into it. However I would greatly recommend checking to see if your computer can run it, and if it can't turn of shadows.

 Call of Duty: WWII [/b] Summarization Call of Duty: WWII is definitely a good attempt at going back to the series' roots and origins gameplay wise while maintaining the cinematic and dramatic experience the recent entries have put on the table, the game combines both original and unoriginal factors. It is a must buy if you want a good long break from exo suits, futuristic weapons, and want a good throwback to Call of Duty's old days. Details start here  Gameplay In my short yet effective hour/s of playing this game, the gameplay and mechanics still feel as a Call of Duty should. The re-addition of the health bar mechanic is a good throwback for those returning CoD 1 fans and also is a good leash on overly rushy type of players, this however only applies to the main campaign. You can heal up by obtaining first-aid kits from fellow soldiers and from the ground. Multiplayer is of course good but not perfect, as the PC port is more exposed to modders and hackers. For now, we will stick to the MP itself rather than it's community first. There isn't much change as the Loadout system is still present and functioning, weapon XP, player XP, killstreaks, and the such are still here.  Story I will review this properly when I have the ideal hours and experience within story mode Graphics The graphics in this game are very well done as it gives a lifelike (obviously not 100% real) look. Not much else to say in this department. End. Thank You for your time"

												This game is amazing. Long campaign missions nice variety of weapons maps are not too big or too small. Divisions are a nice add to this game too.  Online is very fun. Got the game today and already played 5 hours. 1 hour in single player 4 hours+ In multiplayer. I reccomend this game if you like a world war 2 setting as well as world war 2 weapons. This game brings a ton of fun and you would probably enjoy it."

UPDATE:I've found a way to prevent the mouse from slowing down when frames are low! This may not work for you, but all I had to to was unpark my cpu. If that doesn't work for you, please contact sledgehammer and complain.Optimization:The game is very optimized, no issues at all with gameplay. (From my experience)Campaign:Great campaign, lots of fun, I had no problems with it. People are complaining about length, but bo1, bo2, AND waw, all had 7 hour or shorter campaigns. So I'm not too fussed. Zombies:Great zombies mode, far better than black ops 3's or infinite warfare's, they just need to nerf the Wüstlings. Multiplayer:Decent multiplayer, could be better, plus it has some connection issues. Not to mention a lot of pc players are sweaty, so that can ruin your fun sometimes. Issues:Oh, and kind of a big thing here, the mouse sensitivity is tied to framerate. Meaning you either have to constantly hit a high framerate, OR you must lock your frames. Verdict:Once they iron out the issues I mentioned, this game is golden."

												Call of Duty: WWII is a return to the original recipe, the first game set during the Second World War in 10 years. In a lot of ways it attempts to reboot the series as a more grounded, a more sober military shooter.Now first and foremost i'd just like to point out that this is just my initial review, as the game hasn't been out for a week yet but i just want this review to be a reflection of what the first week of this game has been like. So as far as it goes with my experience with this game so far I have only played the first campaign mission so far. I have a couple hours in zombies. However, when it comes to multiplayer i've already prestiged twice and on my way to the third prestige. I think i have roughly 40 hours played so far that's where the bulk of my time has been spent . If you're new here or just don't know my background with call of duty. I started playing Call of duty with Call of Duty 4 in 2007. I've been playing the franchise for 10 years. I've gone back and played every single call of duty game that's been made.So i think i have a decent grasp on the Call of Duty series.The CampaignThe first thing i noticed about the campaign and i'm sure you'll notice this as well is just how lifelike it is. The graphical leap from Call of Duty Ghosts to advanced warfare was actually pretty good but because it was set in the future and it had like a fictitious setting, it kind of makes it hard to appreciate the art style if that makes any sence. So when you have a game like COD WWII that as a realistic setting, the graphic fidelity and the art style really shines through. Honestly it's kind of scarily photorealistic like Call of Duty 4 was back in 2007. The other thing that's really cool about the campaign is that it has a lot of elements of classic Call of Duty. If you'v been playing this franchise since 2003 or 2004  then you're probably accustomed to not having health regen in campaign. Call of duty 2 innovated this in 2005 by having a health regen system btu now in this game ,  we don't have it. I will say that it's not as cumbersome as the older Call of Duty games, you don't have to hunt or scavenge the entire map trying to look for a health pack. You just have squad mates that can resupply you with ammo or give you health. The COD WWII campaign also draws some similarities to Call of Duty 2's campaign in terms of the level design and the enemy AI, which I think will be pretty nostalgic for some players. Even just judging from the first campaign mission this game offers character and personality and refinements like World at War did back then. Eventhough it has all of these elements the game also has its own identity it can be extremly gruesome but emotional at times. And again im only one mission deep but i'm really curious to see where it goes from here. Now is this campaign harder, challenging like COD 2 - on veteran was back then? Again this is my initial review. I'm playing the campaign on recruit purley for the story. But eventually i'm going to go back through and play all of the missions on veteran so will edit this review at some point. The one thing i'm not big on in the campaign is the quicktime events. Sure they're kind of unique and not as annoying as some games but it still really just doesn't add to the gameplay or the story. It just forces you to not fall asleep during cutscenes, which if that's what they're going for that's cool. I'm just never personally gonna be a huge fan of quicktime events. ZombiesThere's only one thing I have to say about zombies in Call of Duty WWII: FLIEGERFAUST!!! This one rocket launcher is the single greatest thing i've seen in Call of Duty zombies . The power fantasy that this thing gives you is just ridiculous. It's just really just a rocket launcher with multiple rounds but it is so stupidly strong and fun to use and obviously if you can upgrade it that will make it even more stupdly fun to use. ""Play zombies, get this weapon, profit GG"" I haven't really played this zombies as much as BO3 as i don't fell the same vibe and such.MultiplayerI'm gonna kinda start with the bad stuff, move onto some stuff that's okay and end up with some good things and also some requests. Bad Stuff:Some people migh say that Call of Duty WWII launch is unacceptable.I think we can all agree with this, the game has had some issues at launch and it's not to be taken lightly. The log-in servers for the game have been on and off, you get this stupid alphabet error. The load times matches have so slow that sometimes you're just loaded in the next game and you can't even change anything. I also heard about a rank reset glitch but thankfully that enver happened to me . I'm feel sorry for anyone who experienced this glitch but apparently it's been addressed already, which is good. Now i would say that all of these problems should be expected because of sheer amount of players trying to get on and play this game  but at the same time it should have been predicted. There should have been more stuff preemptively done to prevent this from ever happening. At the same time, i don't think this is as bad as people are making it out to be. Clearly some of these people weren't around for Battlefield 4 or GTA 5s online launch. Those games initially had much worse launches, this is nothing compared that . But again i'm not trying to make light of it, these things that need to be taken care of as soon as possible so that way it can ensure a good experience. Now this one might be a little bit more subjective and it's just something that i noticed but it seems like playing on a 2 bar or worse connection can just feel unplayable. Sometimes it j ust feels like you've died faster and you need more bullets to kill enemies and when that happenes there's just no point of staying in the  lobby. Connection seems to be very important in this game so if you have bad internet or a bad NAT type you need to try to address it. Otherwise you could honestly have a very skewed view of the multiplayer.The Okay meh Stuff:This game needs ground war. It needs 9v9. I don't want it to become a weekend game-mode like it is in BO3, that's just stupid. You can currently go into a private match and load in with 18 people or 17 bots. It's possible we just don't have it online. On top of that I think it would be nice to have even bigger player counts. Playing 12v12 or more on PC has been an absolute blast in the past and i'll like to Call of Duty go more in this direction because it would just be so much more chaotic and fun. That's just a little bit more subjective that's just my opinion. This next one kind of will be as well. The STG44, is it overpowered or overused? Now i personally think that it's overused and i don't know how to feel about it quite yet, all i've noticed that in my matches it's pretty  mcuh dominating the kill feed and players are gennerally not taking any interest in using other weapons, which is a shame. The same thing pretty much goes for the FG42, the PPSH and the type 100 but not quite to the same degree. The STG44 is a mindless rifle to use it's just stupdily easy to use. I pretty much equated it to the ACR of Modern Warfare 2 it's for people who don't even try to challenge themselves whatsosver. With that being said I think it's still too early to ask for a nerf but i just wanna see some weapon variety. I don't want this to be a long term porblem like the BAL and ASM1 in Advanced Warfare. However, i would like to ask for some buffs to two weapons. Pretty much the both of the double barreled shotguns, they are so underwhelming and boring and terrible to use. They are str8 trash. I'll habe an easier time trying to kill someone by poming them to death with a blade of grass. Please increase the damage, increase the reload speed just make something to make these guns actaully usable. Next up is supply drops. In their current state I actually think they're OK again in it's current state they can only be earned for free."

We just can play when I find lobby with about 11/12 or less players in match who's prepared for next match and with lighting speed before time is running out for the next match I must send to friend on steam invite to the game and then we can play. That's  the only way it works . It's just like lottery to play together. C'mon sledgehammer games fix your s**t up.

												Rating 9/10I have played almost every Call of Duty and by far I would have to say this is my favourite one yet. I enjoy going back to the basics no jetpacks, abilities, wallclimbing. It's definatley a very enjoyable pace and don't even get me started about the amazing way they made the zombies.Multiplayer:I enjoyed most of the maps other than the large snow one due to me being a close quaters combat player but that's just personal prefrence. I definatley enjoy all the maps and love the way they all layout.There is definatley good guns/bad guns in all games and I think that the LMG's outweigh the other classes by far.Really enjoy the way the Class prestiges work with the different unlocks that you receive. Makes it worth while to grind all of the classes and get the last bonuses (silent footsteps, faster movement, faster movement scoped and less damage to grenades)Zombies:Thrilling, Immersive and Fun all at the same time. Definatley a good direction change in the zombies franchize.It is actually semi-difficult with the armor helmet zombies, the fly zombies, flamethrower guy ect ect.Singleplayer:To be honest I haven't played much single player but I did do the first mission and it felt awesome. Having to find med packs around the map the way the characters feel together.Overall a very good game that will be played by me for hours on end."

												I have recommended this game, I waited a long time for it be released and it has excellent gameplay and graphics but, I've completed it after 12 hours on the hardest setting, it just isn't long enough and I find this with all Call of Duty games now, they are just too short and that makes them very disappointing when you've waited months to play it. I find that if you try to take your time, the other characters nag at you to ""open the door"" or ""use the Bazooka"" etc. forcing you into making the next move.Also, whilst I was awaiting the release date I watched video after video of how authentic and real they wanted to make the game and really they've done a great job of doing that but, they have missed the little things and have made the exact same mistake all military game producers make and for me it lets down all that research. Armed forces NEVER use the term ""over and out"" on a radio and I heard it twice in this game. ""Over"" is used to tell the other person that you expect a reply, ""out"" is used to tell them that you don't want a reply so by using ""over and out"" you're telling them to reply and not to reply in one sentence.Come on guys 12hrs to complete and silly inconsistencies, you're pushing the friendship"

												I'm really enjoying this game! The campaign I really liked and I even got emotional a few times. Though that tank mission did get me very triggered, I eventually completed it. The game in gerneal looks and plays great on my 1060 and i5-6500. This is my first time playing COD on PC as I've only played it on Playstation. The last COD I thoroughly enjoyed was MW3 as the newer ones didn't really click for me, so I havent't played this franchise in a while. I quite missed the arcade, run and gun, style shooter with small maps. With Overwatch and Destiny 2 being my other two FPS games I greatly enjoy on PC, this game was a refresher and brought me back to the good old days.Many people complained with the older CODs that it was just the same thing year after year. So the developers changed the game with the jet packs and a futuristic setting. Then people complained that it didn't feel like COD anymore. So, now we have COD WW2 which is going back to the style of their older games, and people still complain. Can't please everyone I guess.I respect those who genuinely dislike the game because it might not be their playstyle. If you're looking to get a thorough history lesson from a video game, look somewhere else. It's not a documentary. I feel like people just hate on COD just because they're on the hate train. They try this game and then just look for things to hate on. Just like how people who are afraid of spiders will find more spiders lurking around in their homes than people who are not, because they're more concious of them. In conclusion, It's quite simple. If you don't like the franchise, don't buy this game beucase it'll probably be all the things you're expecting it to be. A Call of Duty game."

												I'm starting to think that we as consumers have gotten impossible to please.Everytime a new release comes out in the last couple years, immediately we all hit the store page and find page upon page of mixed reviews, and in many cases these are deserved - the gaming culture has changed to one of loot box galore and tacked on microtransactions - as releases are rushed and games are plagued with buggy launches.This game is by no means perfect, but I don't believe it's outright garbage like every other review would lead you to believe. Every review is slating the game practically as we all want everything to be perfect now with no bugs or flaws. I'm not trying to make excuses, I know some have had horrendous issues even trying to start the game, and for those people I do feel sorry for as they've spent their hard earned money, only to be bitterly dissapointed that they can't play the game they've spent ÂŁ45 on because the game has trouble with certain setups.Now onto the game itself:The campaign is enjoyable and reminds me a lot of the older Medal of Honor games due to the soundtrack. Yes there's innacuracies and some weapon sounds are dissapointing, but it is still a good bit of fun. Not sure how long it is as I've only played 3 odd hours of it, but I know I've been enjoying it.The multiplayer is also very enjoyable, much like Black Ops 2's multiplayer back at release. Great fun if you're prepared to be laden with those who seem incapable of playing objectives. Currently there are issues with the servers going down but I'm hopeful these will be fixed in due course. There is quite a reliance on sniper rifles now unfortunately, some of the maps in the war gamemode are just not balanced for sub-machine guns or shotguns as they are based on long sightlines but in other modes every weapon is perfectly viable.So far the game has run perfectly for me with a 3.0 GHz i5 and a GTX 970 with 8gb of DDR3 RAM. Not had a single issue performance wise, nor even a single crash. The only issue I've encountered is my FOV keeps resetting and if I equip a heroic weapon then the loadout resets after every game.In essence, buy this game if you want. I enjoy it, and I've had a great amount of fun with it just over the weekend after release alone. This may be down to me having had no issues, and being a general sucker for WW2 games but I honestly think it is a good game. I currently have 14 odd hours at the time of this review, but it only shows 3 as that's all I've played of the single player."

												so yeah, umm firstly preordered the game and preloaded it--> morning comes, day off, so i deside to try out my new cod (first one i bought since first black ops.) and what do you know, had to wait for 1hour to game to load or unkrypt or something. anoyed but ok, i can live with that. then want to play single player (multiplayer not even loaded) game starts and settings to optimiced, ahh cant wait to play.. so naturaly the game grashes after couple of minutes in cinematics. for f... sake. try again and again and now can not even get to the menus without crashing. ---> loads mp and by some miracle that works. play one match and get myâĽâĽâĽâĽâĽhanded to me (no surprise here). return to the singleplayer and now game crashes whole computer... ...if this would happen in real life then designers or whoever is responsable would be fired instantly.but as this is only a game it does not matter. we'll fix it eventually, maybe.not impressed.computer:i7700ktitan-x16gb ramand more than enough space in ssd'slates drivers&sh*t"

												âĽâĽâĽâĽing sucks.Edit1: It's the same stuff over and over. I didn't feel the need to write a whole essay on that. It's obvious enough. And don't get me started on the historical inaccuracies that this game offers.Edit2: Also requested a refund(approved and waiting). When I originally wrote the review, it was 0300ish in the morning, so I just wanted to speak my mind. And, speaking my mind means that this game really does âĽâĽâĽâĽing suck.Edit3: It's still terrible. Needed that badge.The âĽâĽâĽâĽ is a Waffe 20 or whatever it was called? Isn't that the made up gun from Infinite Warfare? Or am I missing something?The D-Day Beach Invasion was so lackluster and felt so... cheap. When you go and write a game that is based off of a tragic incident such as the D-Day on the beaches of Omaha, at least give it some thought.It was terrible. I expected Saving Private Ryan material. But no, I didn't get any of that. Sure, the guys in the front getting mowed down was okay, but everything felt so cliche(and no I don't mean my Country's soldiers getting mowed down is a good thing).The Wehrmacht using PPSH's on the beach? What the absolute âĽâĽâĽâĽ? Yes, the Krauts used them from time to time due to their design(Russian Engineering heh) and performance. BUT ON THE FRONTLINES? No, I'm sorry, I can't deal with that. It makes zero sense.Before I refunded the game, I could barely stand getting through the first Mission before I had enough of it. The firearms felt so stale. When I'm playing a game that uses any firearm, I expect to see and almost ""feel"" the power behind it. When firing the M1 Garand in the game, it felt like I was shooting .22's, not .308's.I could go on and on(and the Colt 1911 is using recycled animations from every one handed-pistol in the CoD Franchise), but it's not worth it. The first CoD(IIRC) had the Omaha beach invasion. They did it PERFECTLY. The ""30 seconds"" and the whistles. No, none of that, all I heard was laughing and small-talk, which is by far so damned out there that it had me edging to refund it right there.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, honestly. I'm always about the Singleplayer when it comes to Call of Duty games and especially in the World War 2 genre.That's my review. If you don't like my review, more power to you. If you like the game, more power to you also. My opinion is not a fact, but the game tried and failed at Historical Accuracy.In reference to the comments below:1.) I attempted to play the Singleplayer Campaign, and it failed to even keep me interested. I had no character bond, and I could care less whether they died or not.2.) If I were posting this review to look cool, I'm not sure I would have said what I said in the first place.3.) Now it's more constructive.4.) When you write and build a game based on real life events and make it look likeâĽâĽâĽâĽâĽâĽ of course the first thought that comes to mind is historical inaccuracies, so screw off.1/10, the developers don't have any balls."

												Call of Duty World War II is a damn good game.  I am fortunate to have a beastly rig that contains an i7 6700k, 32GB of DDR4 Ram also complimented by a GTX 1080ti. It runs like a dream, because I am consistently achieving 100+ fps all settings maxed out @ 4K. If you are not achieving the performance you believe you should be, I would check to make sure that your Nvidia or AMD Drivers are fully updated to 388.13 for Nvidia and Crimson ReLive 17.11.1 from AMD as both of these drivers were released with the intention of optimizing this game very recently. Now if that did not help then try adding some ram. That usually fixes some performance issues. Now the actual review...Audio:The sound design is incredible, the weapon's sound intimidating, the screams of pain from the soldiers as they are shot are horrible to hear (good horrible). The zombies sound extremely creepy and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Zombies in Call of Duty has not creeped me out since Mob of The Dead from Black Ops 2. Or even zombies in general back in World at War. The music is perfect in my opinion. Especially the main menu theme, it sets the tone for me. I found myself bowing my head in silence for a few seconds because of how depressing the topic of WWII is as a whole. Visuals:For me at 4K with maxed out settings, the game looks absolutely gorgeous. Even on the lower graphics settings the game still looks like a joy to play. In the opening campaign mission, I was extremely horrified and felt extremely sad that anyone had to experience such a terrible event like D-Day. The game does a pretty good job of making it seem convincing. The visuals really go and in hand with the sounds because everything seems real to me, and that is what I love. The sounds of gunfire wizzing by your head, the yells of german soldiers as you advance towards them in the bunkers gives me a very good idea of what the actual soldiers had to deal with.Gameplay: Campaign wise, I have to admit that I really love the manual healing via medic bags. I am still not fully used to it but I welcome it completely. Objective wise, I am only on the first mission, while playing on hardened difficulty but it still appears to be the same formula as you would expect from a Call of Duty campaign, Do this, checkpoint, do this, checkpoint a couple more rinse and repeats and level completed. That is not a bad thing as I have played all COD campaigns from COD4- Infinite Warfare and loved them all so therefore I cannot wait to continue the campaign.Multiplayer: I can only describe it with one word, batshit crazy. Oops, sorry I lied. Its for the most part the same standard COD formula. However I love the addition of the Headquarters, which is pretty much in the simplest words the COD version of Destiny's Tower. For the first time ever we have prestige unique weapons, too. However my personal favourite addition is the ""War"" gamemode because believe it or not I forgot I was playing multiplayer, It felt like a campaign mission because we had to do real life tasks that the real sodiers had to do. Whether it would be defend or storm the beach, or defend or destroy a bridge, and etc these types of game modes are what Call of Duty needs more of. If I want to run around like a maniac I would rather play Counter Strike, because those games do not look realistic so in my opinion it is ok to not play out realistically, but if it looks the part it should play the part too, enough said because even Battlefield is guilty of this.Nazi Zombies:Without a doubt a lot of thought went into the mode. The zombies themselves look and sound disturbing, especially when they talk occasionally. Oh does that make my hairs on the back of my neck stand up when I hear their garbled, demonic voices. The game is more of the same formula again but the fact that they are Nazi Zombies make them that much more enjoyable to send to Hell...again.Conclusion:Buy this game, it is a really good PC port and at one point I saw 50, 000 players online. I think CoD on PC will be great again. Truly I do. If money is an issue there are 3rd party websites that can help you get a little discount on the game. Thanks for reading :)"

												Call of Duty: WWII! The only game which rallies 'Historian Elitists' like the seagull's in Finding Nemo looking for fish, but in a more comedic and salty way ironically!Before I make fun of everyone in this review, I'll at least put my thoughts about the game in first.Campaign?: Good. It was probably the only campaign to get me to care about my squad since Operator Skully and Operator Detergent died, and adding health packs was a bit annoying, but it forces the casuals to actualy STRATEGIZE! But I couldn't cheese the enemy as easily.Multiplayer?: GARBAGE! Unless you're into twitch shooters with little content, and only one interesting new mode, War Mode, I don't see you playing the multiplayer for more than 2 hours. But the multiplayer hub is kind of neat. And the weapon custimization is just disgusting, mainly because the attachments you can get are just 'wat'. I guess people can't shoot without a green dot site or extended mags that don't exist to compensate for their bad aiming.Zombies?: Okay! Not hard to get it wrong, but not enough content to play it more than two hours as well.AND That's all I have to say. I can talk about how good the graphics is or how I hate twitch shooters, but who cares about that!? I'm going to make fun of a bunch of complaints I saw instead!""There was no women in WWII!"": That's a lie, while women weren't soldiers for most factions, both Germany and the Russian had a company of female soldiers, albiet one each. And in regards to that one mission in the campaign where 'OH MY GOD A ♥♥♥♥♥♥, REEEH!' She was a french revolutionary and a spy AND wasn't even in a military unit, so if her accent or her speaking french half the time didn't tip you off, you clearly need to watch Ratatouille. Seriously, i learned this stuff after one google search, so checkmate. Now if you're referring to the multiplayer, Man or Woman, they die just as easily. So I don't really care for it""There was no black people in WWII!"": Albiet being more rare, there was definitely African Americans in WWII..and WWI...And the American Civil War. Not much to argue here.""There aren't wearing swaztakas (Not gonna spell check that)"": I'm pretty sure most German soldiers didn't wear them in battle, and was more for show during parades and stroking Hitler's ego. Commanders and high ranking Officers definitely had them, and they were shown in the game multiple times. ""There uniforms aren't correct!"": Sorry, none of us can hear you while we're wracking 100+ Kills in the first ten minutes of the campaign. If you're so picky as to actually check their Uniforms, you need to learn the F word. ""Fun"".I'm just surprised a great percentage of people who bought this game was expecting, historical accuracy to a T. It's Call of Duty!! It hasn't been Historically Accurate since COD4. World At War was probably the most, but even then they were pushing it.So to read all the salty comments later, I'm going to leave this recommended for now, but my personal verdict is to only buy it for the Campaign and it's Zombie mode. For...$30 at most."

												BTW THE TIME IN GAME ONLY SHOWN ON THIS REVIEW ONLY COUNTS FOR SINGLE PLAYER FOR SOME REASON.Where to start. This game is a solid meh, If there was a sideways thumb I'd give it. It has fun(ish) with A LOT of ping issues. (I have very good internet but the connection to the servers are just a joke.) You can get killed behind walls, there are already hackers, the loby is a useless copy of Destiny (even if it is pretty sick), and the higher level weapons are op as hell. All that said however, it does go back to ""boot's on the ground"" which is a plus. I don't like the way they've redone movement. I like how they have made it so you can't fly and♥♥♥♥♥♥but the sprinting is weird. Like somtimes you can sprint for long distances and sometimes you cant. Some classes when you level up you can sprint for longer and faster (like tf). And also there are not enough maps. Like I know that there are 3 war maps but I never get put in the D-Day one. It's not just me either, most of my friends that play this game only play 4 diffrent muliplayer maps and never get put in any others. ALSO WTF THE SEASONS PASS IS $69. BUT the singleplayer is outstanding. That whole review might sounds negitive but this game if so ♥♥♥♥ing addicting. And I like it with all of it's problems and issues. It's not as good as I expected it to be, but it is still pretty decent.Can I just mention the other reviews. Wtf guys, this isn't a ♥♥♥♥ing WWII simulator its COD. I don't care if the Germans are using Russian guns, and most people I think won't either."

												I am abosulutely disgusted with some of these comments.. Everyone needs to get off their highhorse and stfu. They made this game for the fans! After years of us saying we didnt like the old ones. Some of you are just ungrateful, spitting your milk out over minor things left out of the game. Yes fair enough, if they added these things into the game then it would be more realistic but thats not the point! Its a game! They have a target demograph, they have buisness regulations and restrictions that they must follow. Including not offending anyone. And the comments about 'women shouldnt of been in the game' shut your ignorant♥♥♥♥♥up. It was nice of them to include them specially for the french resitance. As there actually were female spies/volunteers that went into battle. But you guys need to remember this is just a game, yes its set in ww2 and has you doing realistic missions etc But thats what makes the narrative. They cant just be like 'yeah heres ww2 but we're going to pump out cliche moments in war' no they did their own thing and make it work. The visual effects for the campaign and multiplayer are amazing! It feels like you're in a movie and the amount of empathy you feel for your main characters is incredible. People need to stop thinking highly of themselves and appreciate things alot more."

The characters in the game look outstanding and the environments, they look good to me as well. People having stuttering, I suggest a reinstall. Wolfenstein did that to me and a reinstall fixed it. Zombie mode, within 5 minutes managed to freak me out numerous times. Plays just like you remember just a bit darker, immersion wise. Multiplayer, well I suck at it but again, its CoD. I havent played CoD multiplayer since World at War so I dont know if the new zone they implimented is a new thing to CoD or its been used before. Its neat to pick up tasks to achieve to keep you pushing for a goal and not just kills."

You can run around and inspect other players loadouts, check out their lootdrops and weapons range just there so you can check out new guns or scopes on the fly without load times! game is getting a bad wrap, but this is a great breath of new details and things to call of duty that all feel refined and familiar"

												Very good campaign, decent graphics and my i7 and GTX 1070 ran the game without sweat. However when I try and play multiplayer I constantly get the msg saying no network detected which is BS as Im on a wired connection. Zombies reminded me of BO3 zombies just not as good. its always 100mph running around."

												This is going to be a refund. Wanted to play Nazi Zombies split screen, and the Steam tags clearly say ""Local Co-op"", but there is no option for it?! The tags are wrong, and the ""Local Co-op"" tag should be removed. Not going to pay twice for this game at full price just to play it with friends. Feels like a cash grab.  Tried all possible variants and even contacted the support, but didn't get any answers. Needed to create an Activition account to reach their official support, and I did not want accept the agreement so I got no support, except the ""Activision ambassador"" that was a troll, not serious at all.Furthermore the game is horribly optimized and historically inaccurate.EDIT:Got a comment saying it should have the tag ""Split screen"" if the game was to support it. Probably got confused by the second google result when googling ""Cod WW2 split screen"":https://twitter.com/codww2intel/status/652566006909546496?lang=en This was a false statement then. Don't think this is the official twitter for the game, but even with 155k followers Activision had no interest in correcting them.It also seems split screen is available on console. Way to go removing functionality for the so called ""master race"". But sheep think it's okay buying multiple copies of the same game even in the same household. Way to go Activision, your business model at least seem to work."

												I am abosulutely disgusted with some of these comments.. Everyone needs to get off their highhorse and stfu. They made this game for the fans! After years of us saying we didnt like the old ones. Some of you are just ungrateful, spitting your milk out over minor things left out of the game. Yes fair enough, if they added these things into the game then it would be more realistic but thats not the point! Its a game! They have a target demograph, they have buisness regulations and restrictions that they must follow. Including not offending anyone. And the comments about 'women shouldnt of been in the game' shut your ignorant♥♥♥♥♥up. It was nice of them to include them specially for the french resitance. As there actually were female spies/volunteers that went into battle. But you guys need to remember this is just a game, yes its set in ww2 and has you doing realistic missions etc But thats what makes the narrative. They cant just be like 'yeah heres ww2 but we're going to pump out cliche moments in war' no they did their own thing and make it work. The visual effects for the campaign and multiplayer are amazing! It feels like you're in a movie and the amount of empathy you feel for your main characters is incredible. People need to stop thinking highly of themselves and appreciate things alot more."

The characters in the game look outstanding and the environments, they look good to me as well. People having stuttering, I suggest a reinstall. Wolfenstein did that to me and a reinstall fixed it. Zombie mode, within 5 minutes managed to freak me out numerous times. Plays just like you remember just a bit darker, immersion wise. Multiplayer, well I suck at it but again, its CoD. I havent played CoD multiplayer since World at War so I dont know if the new zone they implimented is a new thing to CoD or its been used before. Its neat to pick up tasks to achieve to keep you pushing for a goal and not just kills."

And those who are complaining about the PPSH being used on the western front. All of germanys factories were destroyed any gun they could salvage was the best they could get. Mulitplayer is good campaign is great and the nazi zombies are actually pretty fun even if i do prefer treyarch a bit more. Overall its a good game dont let the anti call of duty hate sweep you up.

												I dont play Call of Duty since Black Ops 1 and when i played the beta of this COD i had so many good memories of how good i felt playing this FPS . I played Call of Duty WWII BETA for 42h and i loved it . Why should you buy it ? Because its a WWII game where you have a fantastic customization , a game where the campaign is fantastic and you really feel that you are inside of the story , the multiplayer as so many things to do especially in HQ , you will find a good variety of weapons and there is a lot of them to come , well i fairly believe on this COD because Sledgehammer Games did what they said they would do . Their trying to change and this COD is the proof of that so i think sometimes we need to risk like SLedgehammer Games is doing . If you like the game and the game concept go for it because its really a master piece . Cya and good games ;) ."

												I've spent over 24hrs in multiplayer so far, I've enjoyed the campaign so far, approximately half way through. I don't normally review games on steam but I find the immense tidal wave of negative reviews very strange. The game is a solid call of duty game and is exactly what I expected for my money, the game is absolutely worth it's price tag as there is so much content to get through. If you like call of duty you will like this game, it's more of the same just WW2 flavoured which is always a bonus for me. The game feels much better than world at war did and runs very smoothly on my PC on max settings, literally had no problems with it.The only bad point for me so far was spending more than 2 hours in zombies and getting to the final boss only for everyone to get disconnected from the game. We lost all XP and progression which ♥♥♥♥ing sucked. As a result we're gonna wait until those bugs get ironed out before heading back into nazi zombies."

But after 3 days of the release something made me buy it. I downloaded it jumped straight in to the multiplayer (I play mostly mp) and after these 7h play time in multiplayer i just love the multiplayer i have not had any problems with it. Some people we're crying about no teamwork and people just run & gun but isn't that what all the cod games mostly are??! And most of the bad reviews came about campaing that it isn't historically accurate and something like that. So if you mostly play multiplayer i recommend it really highly and you don't care if it's historically accurate or not then go for it!!!"

												This is by far one of the best Call of Dutys to date for me.  I know it might not be popular opinion but I really enjoyed the campaign, (which for me was the best one in the series by far), the multiplayer is somewhat slower than the predecesors, but it still holds up as classic Call of Duty multiplayer.  The nazi zombies is really enjoyable too, but I wish they would've included more than a short prologue and one map.  It seems like in the zombies mode they didn't add as much blood as the campaign or the multiplayer for some reason.  I know it's really kinda insignificant but it would be a nice touch to have the zombies bleed a lot more since the map and the zombies themselves looked really gory and slimey.  As for the headquarters, I like it and it's a nice addition to be able to 1v1 people and get field orders that give you extra XP.  Overall this is my favorite Call of Duty to date and I definitly recommend it if you haven't been a fan of the futuristic setting of the last three.  I definitly recommend this game to anyone."

												This is a quick review coming from a die-hard Battlefield fan....Call of Duty WWII is the best Call of Duty game I have played in years. The campaign is a solid B in my book. Plently of exciting parts, a tank sequence and a plane sequence that kept things interesting. However, character development is lacking and I only felt attached to one of my squadmates, all the others I could barely remember their names. Multiplayer is great. The new War mode is by far the best gamemode Call of Duty has ever released. This new gamemode takes a page out of Battlefield's playbook which is totally fine by me! Zombie mode returns on steroids! Zombie mode is definitly a huge plus for this game. However, the Call of Duty community is one of the most toxic communties of any game. It really is noticable when playing in multiplayer."

												Absolutely amazing. When I played the Open Beta, this game  looked promising, and it didn't fail to satisfy. The weapons feel pretty balanced (Except the Louis Gun, pease nerf this, it's too op XD) and the attachments mostly go with the World War II era. Haven't played zombies yet, but it looks great from what I've seen. I do recommend this more than Infinite Warfare (But I still loved that game) and it feels much better (No E X O J U M P S or E X O S L I D E S anywhere, and they brought dolphin diving back!)"

												Alright, so i've spent a few hours in this game. (Dont let the hour counter trick you, this is for the campaign which i havent played a lot of yet) The multiplayer is great, the War gamemode can be good or bad, depending on if your teammates actually give a crap about the objective or just want to try and get kills. Apart from that i have no complaints about multiplayer, Headquarters is pretty cool, you can do a lot of things, you can target practice, you can test out scorestreaks, 1v1 people and do objectives that reward you. Now onto zombies. I'm a massive fan of zombies. This Nazi Zombies mode has blown me away. The zombies are incredibly detailed, from their look to the way they move and sound, just amazing job on them alone, the charging zombie can be annoying because 3-4 can spawn and get in your way when you're training a horde of zombies, obtaining the tesla gun is a part of the game objective which is cool, its optional if you want to upgrade it or not, upgraded tesla guns are awesome but the process to upgrade them can be very tedious, however if you want to do the main easter egg, you have to upgrade all four. The easter egg in itself is pretty cool, you fight a giant monstrosity filled with zombies holding it all together, its not that scary but it hits hard. I've completed the easy and hard easter egg with a few friends and had some fun. All in all, this zombies experience was amazing and i cannot wait to see what they have in store for us in DLC 1, i really hope things get even better from here. Solid game thus far."

I have a 3440x1440 monitor so often games struggle with that. This is supported by default with no extra tweaks or edits, and it is very customizeable (in-menu FoV adjustment, and even a separate sensitivity for 'Aim Down the Sight'? That's awesome!). Graphics are good, had no crashes, no frame rate issues, story seems OK so far (actually good by CoD standards). I have yet to try the multiplayer though..."

												This isn't your average CoD.Prologue:When I heard that the next Call of Duty to be released was going take it back to WW2, its true roots, I was very pleased. ""Finally a AAA title based on WW2 again,"" I thought to myself. Then I discovered that it would be led by Sledgehammer Games, a very reputable creator. I patiently waited for more information about to game to be released. At last, the first trailer was released. As soon as I heard that ping from the M1, I was locked in. I knew from then on that I would buy the game. Then they released the Nazi Zombies trailer. A flurry of nostalgia from WaW's Nazi Zombies came upon me and before I knew it I had preordered the Digital Deluxe Edition. Back to the waiting game. After waiting a few months, the multiplayer beta weekend was released. I played the beta for a solid 5-10 hours, and although multiplayer isn't exactly my cup of tea in the CoD franchise I found myself enjoying it. The weekend came to an end. Once again I had to wait, but this time for only a few weeks. Finally the game was released.My experience with the ""game"":I spent all of yesterday dying to go home just to find out what the game really had in store for me. When I jumped in I was shocked. For as long as I could remember, in CoD history, you were always just thrown into a frontline battle where your only goal was to push forward and get as many kills as you could. I immediately realized that this ""game"" was going to be drastically different from the ones before it. I was put on a ship where my platoon and squad were being human and just playing around as friends, as brothers. Finally, the action began and I was put directly into the beach sccene from Saving Private Ryan. I was astonished and I instantly realized a simple fact: this ""game"" didn't glorify war or its ""heros"" like its predecessors did. I won't go into any more detail, so as not to spoil it, but this ""game"" tackles emotional struggles seen on and off the battle field. I infact, found myself questioning my actions during many parts of the campaign or getting so immersed with in it that I would take the rage of loosing a fellow soldier out on the nearest enemies.This game does not shy away from the horrors commited by either side of the battle, it puts them under bright light for you to see what truly happened in World War II. This not only is my new favorite CoD, but is possibly my new favorite singleplayer ""game"" of all time. All in all, this is a wonderful experience that I recommend to anyone that can stomach the absolute hell of war.Rating*:I easily find this ""game"" to be a stong 10/10 in every aspect: from the emotional stesses/drama; the acting and visual; and even down to the nitty gritty shoot 'em up aspect.Sidenotes:Although I'm not a CoD multiplayer guy by any aspect, I find the multiplayer to be the standard run-of-the-mill ""run around like rambo"" that it always has been, but there are a couple of original gamemodes that have been added to the mix that gave it a more interesting aspect and made it feel like a Battlefield-esque game. The new HQ mode was pretty cool to play around in as well. Many people complained about the SJW stunts sledgehammer pulled to make the game PC. I agree having black female Nazi soldiers is too far, but one of my favorite YouTubers (Rags) has a very informative video that I can get behind and agree with. I suggest that anyone who is concerned about this matter watches this video entirely.When it comes to zombies I'm not a diehard player, but I enjoyed the new maps and mobs as much as the games. The zombies experience in BO3 I still feel is the best you can get, but the WW2's version of it adds a much creepier aspect to it and keeps it fresh with new guns, perks, and upgrades.When I put quotation marks "" around the word game I do this because it didn't feel like a game to me. It felt more like an experience or at least a movie.*Rating of the base game/campaign mode only"

												This is all in my humble opinion but:If you are looking for authenticity and realism,look elsewhere.But if you are looking for a solid COD shooter with potential,this is for you.Pros -Decent singleplayer campaign with decent length.Difficulty levels are quite balanced and challenging.-Zombie mode now resembles something with more of a story,and also features level ups and unlocks,similar to multiplayer.I suggest playing it solo while using a walkthrough to get the hang of it and knowing what to do first.Cons-Weapons in singleplayer campaign are very underpowered.Enemies can even survive multiple headshots.This can make progression through levels on higher difficulties difficult.-The controls in the tank mission are awful,especially in regards to the extremely low mouse sensitivity.The fighter plane mission is still all right in regards to controls,but could use some improvement.Suggestions-Would like to see a full single player DLC,or even better,expansion with an additional number of missions,telling a new story,or full focus on the Pacific theatre,or perhaps a long list of missions covering different factions,similar to Call of Duty 3 on the PS2.-There should be a lot more instances of gibbing by many weapons in the singleplayer campaign.Hope this can be added with future updates.-Oh,and I hope the game developers can do something with regards to CPU processor optimization.My CPU runs a bit on the high side even when playing on lowered graphics settings.-""Low"" or ""None"" options for more graphic advanced settings.This will help those who are playing on less powerful computers."

												I absolutly recommend this game if you're not a special snowflake. I run the game at 150fps on high settings. My specs are lsited at the bottom of my rant.Okay, I don;t know why everyone is b*tching about this game. It is fun, the characters have character, by the end of the campaign you actually feel like you've done something.I have had ZERO issues with this game and I have no issues about the campaign. It is enjoyable and viseral. This is the first game of COD I have played since MW2 and I can say it feels good.Everyone who claims the controls feels like a consol port are F*cking Morons. First off that means absolutly nothing. Remap the keys if your princess♥♥♥♥♥is too good for the basic set up, in reality everything is a f*ucking port to everything else, simply set it up for your needs.Everyone thats b*itching about the setting please shut your stupid snow flake faces. Boo F8cking hoo you need to individually customize your settings for campaign, multiplayer and zombies. Cry me a river. I appreciate the split customization of settings because between the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies I have different needs and it feels good to just get into the gamemode without having to raise or lower settings evertime. The game is good and I believe it is worth the full retail price. Even with microtransactions in the game. Because if you want a gear box then f*cking earn it through challenges. Stop playing the victim because you, by your own free will, spent money and then want to cry and b*tich about it later how they ""stole you money"" Man up and own up to your own actions and stop blamming the game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OS Name --- Microsoft Windows 10 HomeSystem Type --- x64-based PCProcessor --- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz, 2801 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)Installed Physical Memory (RAM) --- 16.0 GBTotal Virtual Memory --- 18.3 GBGraphics --- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070"

												Call of Duty: World War 2 is the newest installment in the Call of Duty series. The previous game in the series was Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare which failed miserably as hackers flooded in. So far, I have not experienced a hacker but unfortunately, the hacker-free COD game will not last. My estimate is that in a week or two, hackers will start flooding in and there will be nothing we can do about it. The bad thing that every COD game experiences in its time are the hackers. Sledgehammer studios do nothing about hackers and that seems to be the downfall to all COD games. Infinite Warfare got flooded with hackers within a week or two. In the open beta of this game back in early October, hackers flooded the servers within 3 days which could be the case really soon. Hopefully SledgeHammer does something about the hackers. I also compare this game to Battlefield 1. The graphics are near enough the same but it feels like COD WW2 is more optimised. I run the game on an AMD graphics card and 3.7GHz with 8GB RAM. I run the game @ medium settings @ 80fps which is quite great compared to how well i run other games (i.e LawBreakers, BattleField1). I run Battlefield 1 on the same specs @ lowest settings @ 40fps. The best thing, at this time of the review, about COD WWII is the multiplayer. Multiplayer is incredibly fun with multiple guns and classes to deal with. You can either be a front line attacker with a submachine gun and a machine pistol. You could be the Pyro that everyone likes with a powerful shotgun and incendiary bullets. Or you could even be a sniper that shoots from the distance. There is a class to suit everyoneâs play style. In multiplayer, there are multiple game modes but some are dead while only a couple have a lot of players. For example, the old Kill Confirmed from COD Ghosts and Co. is always dead in EU morning. But Team Deathmatch is always booming with players. Even when the multiplayer EVENTUALLY fills with hackers, there is a zombies mode Â and campaign to keep you busy. Overall, COD WW2 is an amazing game and probably the best one in the series. I hope that the developers sort out the hacker issue and hopefully it doesnât flood with hackers. This is my fav FPS and COD game and I seriously do not want it to be ruined because of Aimbot. With Aimbotters, I will be able to cope but with the wallhacks and shooting through walls, I will hate the game the second that happens in every game. I rate this game a 4.5/5."

												I don't really have a lot to say except that this probably was what the CoD franchise needed.Performance is stellar in my experience and the new hub in multiplayer is a good addition to the series.I have played every single game in the series excluding console only games and WW2 is easily one of, if not the best game in the franchise in terms of mp and zombies. Can't really say anything about the sp since I havent played it yet.There are lots of improvements since the beta, e.g some gun sounds have been changed for the better and smg's got nerfed somewhat.Zombies thus far has been an immersive and fun experience (spooked) even solo. Tho, to be honest I quite enjoyed playing solo zombies in other cod games as well so if you didn't like soloing zombies before, you're probably not going to like it now either.Only gripes I have at the moment are mostly about cosmetics and immersion. Like for example, black female nazi soldiers in the mp? Why?... And no swastika either, which is weird.But that's about it. All in all, it's a fantastic CoD game and a fantastic WW2 FPS in it's own  right. I kinda feel like this game would get a lot less hate if it didn't have the ""Call of Duty"" label in front of it.Oh and the music is kinda bland in my opinion. Only the menu theme seems like a memorable enough piece.Then again, I think the only cod game with really good music is MW2 for some reason.Anyway, that's my casual take on this. Not really analytic, just saying that in my opinion as a long time series fan this is worth the asking price.PC specs:i7 7700K1080ti32Gb RAMEDIT: Well, played the first few singleplayer missions just now and I've got to say that the performance isn't as good in the sp side of things. I mean I do get around ~100FPS constantly, but there is noticeable microstuttering going on and I don't quite know why. There are also some huge FPS dips happening to the lower 60's high 50's.I have updated to the latest GPU drivers and Win10 updates, so it can't be that. Altho, it seems I do get better performance than most since almost all the negative reviews around this game concern poor optimization. Wouldn't go as far as to say it's a bad port and poorly optimized, but clearly some kind of patch or further driver updates are needed to stabilize the performance.Also, I have not experienced any crashes as of this moment. I'll have to see going forward if this starts happening (hope not).For what it's worth, I'm running the game @2560x1080 max settings, borderless window.EDIT: Just finished the campaign on veteran and here are my closing toughts regarding.The story is fine for the most part, but I had a hard time liking the most central characters (Pierson & Daniels). Supporting cast was pretty good and there were a few standouts who in my opinion stole the show everytime they were along for the ride, like Stiles for example.Somehow this sp campaign left me wanting when it ended tho. I feel like this game could have been so much more if it was more in the style of the older CoD WWII games, e.g CoD 2 where you would fight in multiple theaters of war.Also a sidenote, I didn'l like the cinematics in this game. They kinda broke the experience for me and I feel like this would have been much better if everything just was in game engine.Performance did get better for me, and I rarely if ever saw FPS drops below ~100. New mechanics regarding your teammates work for the most part, but there should have been an option to call them to you or alternatively extend the range from which you could call out to them. I found myself struggling in some instances for medpacs or enemy location callouts, but I couldn't have my allies deliver since they were too far away and I would have died if I were to run over.Gunplay is excellent however, like in most CoD games the controls are responsive and raw mouse movement is snappy. Only time I was cursing the controls was a mission where you have to fly a plane and that was just horrible, I think it's a little too much to ask to just swap to a controller on the fly (pun intended) and then back to mouse & keyboard.Then the last thing I want to talk about is the historical accuracy and portrayal of WWII in this game. Even tho the campaign was enjoyable to play through for the most part, there were genuinely some immersion braking moments throughout and some were so dumb, I can't even fathom how this could have happened.There are, for example the PPSH smg's during D-Day which everyone has already talked about, but it doesn't end there. The Nazis and Wehrmacht are using other russian weapons throughout the sp as well, such as the SVT rifle, and their uniforms are mostly inaccurate too. SS-Officers wear the army iron cross on the armband, which begs the question why? Were they ok with adding swastikaz to the banners and flags, but on someones person? That's apparently too much...Anyway, rambling aside I'd say the experience as a whole was quite enjoyable if you can look past some of the SJW & all around dumb stuff. The main character in this game is unlikeable in my opinion, though he does become more interesting as the story goes on. Supporting cast is really spot on in my opinion tho. There isn't anything particularly memoreable about the sp aside from maybe one mission where you infiltrate a nazi garrison in paris.I would give the sp 6Â˝/10 just because I could not fully immerse myself in the experience due to really blatant historical inaccuracies.EDIT: One last edit to this review and then I'm done. The multiplayer, I'ts better the more you play and every mode there is really well put together and fun. I'm re-scoring it to a more commendable 9Â˝/10 zombies included (Previously 8Â˝/10 for mp+zombies). Sp will remain @ 6Â˝/10 tho.EDIT: Just a small edit to address the flying controls in sp. Using a controller is heavily recommended if you have one. It's easy to change between m+kb and controller since the game automatically detecs the controller (at least XBOne) and switches to it. If you don't have a controller tho, then the controls of the plane are horrible."

Some forgettable characters in the story, not that i really care but women in            the ww2 battlefield kind of breaks the immersion."

												On a historical scale, the game is far from perfect, whether its slamming a stripper clip in under a scope at a 45 degree angle or slapping a mercury red dot sight on a BAR, there are plenty of issues that I have with the game, not to mention the black german soldiers in multiplayer or the censorship of swastikas even though the word Nazi is used every other second.With those negatives aside, the graphics and overall gameplay is inredible. In the limited experience I've had on the zombies mode, the map played really well and it was balanced and very fun, off the first few games I've played on there, I'd say that it's definetly one of the better Call of Duty: Zombies that I've played in a while.The campaign is at least somewhat historical accurate, the visuals and cinematics are amazing and I have truely enjoyed it so far. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that the game is great if you're not looking for it to be historically accurate. The gameplay is fun, zombies are great and the campaign is amazing.I reccomend it, unless you're a die hard Red Orchestra 2 player and will die inside every time you see a black nazi. I'm usually in that crowd, but I truely have enjoyed the game so far."

												Zombie's are back and they scary as hell. If you liked the original Call of Duty 2, then you're sure to Love the sequel, which stays true to the strengths of its predecessor.the game nails the core aspects of first-person-shooter gameplay so well .Opening first level is so good. I felt completely hooked.But just  had to jump in multiplayer,this is my favourite mode. The top-notch gun and explosion effects, the game sounds fantastic. The speech is also pretty amazing, particularly the yelling that your squadmates and enemies do during battle, which plays right into your excitement and tension as you fight.Call of Duty WW2 is just about everything you would hope for and expect from the sequel to one of the most successful World War II shooters of all time. Overall graphics 10/10Probably the best cod we game ever. So much to play and enjoy. Absolute cracker.Buy it now."

												Alright, this is one of the best CoDs to date. (It may say low hours but I have at least 40hrs in Multi)All of the bad reveiws are people just saying the same thing over and over and over. Yes, there are female black soldiers, BUT that is to keep their asses from being sued same with the censorship. You think that the people of this generation won't complain that their race and gender are not available to play as but the white ones are?I havent even touched the campaign yet and I have so much fun everytime I launch the game. Zombies is new and intersting for the 10 minutes I put into it. The game is a LITTLE bit buggy but that is pretty much expected for a new game. Most of them are minor and if you re-launch it's perfectly fine.For everyone crying that it is not historically accurate, GET OVER IT and it is not like its not at all accurate. Such as the guns, all of them are accurate, the killstreaks are accurate, and there is probabley more but I dont really care that much as I play the game for fun and I dont just sit around judging games that are not perfect because they are made for FUN.I had another point but I can't remember what it was while writing this. So yea, buy the game if you like fast-paced first person shooters."

												Reading most of the top reviews, they all seem to be nothing but nitpicking bullsh*t. If you go into the game expecting Arma realism and carrying a general disdain for the franchise, then ofcourse you aren't going to have an enjoyable time.The campaign was enjoyable, there wasn't much of a story involved so getting attached to the characters wasn't easy but yet again, this is a Call of Duty game, not a Telltale game.The multiplayer suffers at the moment with a few issues to do with netcode and lag, but I hope that these will be ironed out in the future.Overall the game is fun and a welcomed change from the previous iterations in the franchise. If you are a fan of these types of games and are willing to overlook the completely ""immersion breaking"" use of the PPSH and SVT in the D-Day mission then I would highly recommend this game."

This is honestly one of the best CODs in a while. Graphics, gameplay, gamemodes, and even the campaign. All worth it. Only con I have is modders already, but they will fix this over time, I hope. Take my word, buy the game."

 Best Call of Duty I have ever played!	Historrically accurate  Campaign	, intense  Multiplayer	 and epic  Zombies	 mode.The only drawback is the CoD hater generation  (which is not the game's fault)	. There are a lot of toxic/salty 'gamers' out there, who'd like to ruin other people's fun with idiot things like comparing this game to completely other set and genre games or saying it's bad just because it's CoD, which is really disappointing.I love this game and if you wanna enjoy it as well, I'd recommend not to argue and don't care about those type of people that I mentioned above.I hope one day players will stop being die-hard CoD haters and will stop complaining like idiot  ♥♥♥♥♥es	 kids when it comes to Call of Duty."

												Finally after 5 years of waiting cod is going back to it's roots.

												Overall, this game is exactly what I wanted it to be. The campaign. This is arguably enough of a reason to buy this game in my opinion. This story is awesome, and engaging. You find yourself liking some characters and hating others, then perhaps reevaluating whether or not they do what they do for the right reasons. On veteran, Zussman is the man. You will find missions without Zussman are a lot harder than missions with him by your side. Medkits and smoke grenades are life.The Multiplayer. Have you ever played Call of Duty before? This is that. Generic CoD multiplayer; good, bad, whatever. If you played CoD 2/3/WaW this pretty much feels like those without the nostalgia.Nazi Zambies. This made me happy. The last zombies mode I liked was in Black Ops. Call of the Dead remains my favorite zombies map. In WW2, it has a very ""Call of the Dead,"" feel to it. Actors I know from various roles playing these characters adding commentary, big zombies that basically act like little Georges, its good♥♥♥♥♥♥ Loadouts are interesting. Perks before you ever enter the game are odd but I like it.TLDR;; multiplayer is generic cod, zombies & the campaign is why its worth msrp.Not sure if i'll stick around for dlc, but all these negative reviews seem unwarranted."

Zombies is also a solid bag of fun if you're into that and again looks incredible @ Ultra above 460p :D MP is insanely good, it's finally gone back to 'Boot's on ground' after 3 miserable years we have gone back to the roots of the mechanics we know and love. I can't praise it enough. So many options to customize your weapon and gear to stand out from the rest. An all new HQ section where you can go and do daily rewards, special rewards and weekly rewards - A 1v1 pit of death with a leaderboard, where you can que to fight other RL players, it also has a spectators zone so people can watch for fun or whilst they wait to have a go. Now not only can you prestige your actual level at 50 as in all prior titles, you can now prestige the various divisions within MP as well, which give rare rewards upon completion. So many improvements over any title currently in the franchise IMO. Essentialy what I'm trying to say is that if you're even remotely interested in checking it out then go DO IT. Ignore the hate, that♥♥♥♥♥♥almost seems fashionable to dish out these days and see it for yourselves! PS: Stam you sad, sad little boy - You must have NO life mate - You seriously have nothing better to do with your time than chat absolute S H I T on here?!

												Honestly I am having a blast playing this game, which i haven't had with a cod game in a long time. I mean, what can i say.The zombies is super intense and amazing with a really good story and easter egg. The campaign was fun for every second i played it while it made me clench my butt cheaks at some point, And the multiplayer has some very fun game modes. I find myselfspending hours on headquarters just challenging others to 1v1's in the pit and shoot outs.My Personal belief is this game rates an 8.5/10The zombies really makes this game whole!Edit: Kinda mad they don't track the number of hours i have on multiplayer....

												This game is amazing. I have not had one issue loading or running the game. The campaign is not the most historical thing ever. A lot of people say the Germans should not have PPSH's in normandy, that is actually soemthing the game did correctly, a lot of the troops germany had came from the eastern front, and used captured weapons from multiple nations. But there are historical issues, it plays more like a modern WW2 action movie and I would think that is what people would expect. The multiplayer has tons of challenges with cool unlocks to keep you interested. The HQ is a new cool concept that acts like a community hub in game and has lots to do. A lot of people are mad that the servers went down on launch but they have been fine since then. Over all 8/10."

Set your sensitivity to 5 and your ads sensitivity to 3. the reduced ads sensitivity helps compensate for the lack of aim assist and prevents you from overshooting while centering. there are still issue with the game as a whole like hit registration and hackers....already. but this tweak helps make it at least playable"

												The Campaign was not bad (In my opinion) but I have a few complaints:1: If the devs were focusing on realism, why did they give the german soldiers Russian weapons? Seriously. Who thought that would be a good idea?2: When your charachter speaks to narrate a cutscene it gets confusing because all of a sudden you hear a random voice talking and all other noises fade out and you're sitting there like: What the hell? Then you realize who is talking and move along.3: D-Day. I wish you were able to move around in the landing craft during the mission. The whole ""landing"" part just being one big cutscene style event sorta took out the immersion and hype for me. I really wanted to attemp rushing off the boat just to see everyone around me get cut down, but instead I'm left in a cutscene laying on the ground. You see some people dying but its not as exciting as running off the ramp. I also wish the beach was larger. The whole misison passes bye so quickly. You don't really feel like you're on the beaches of normandy. I bet if I rushed I could make it to the inland-er part of the mission in less than a minute. (From Landing craft to Bangalore explosion part). The mission could have been five times better if they tried.4: Why does it take more than one shot to kill an enemy? Just why?That's all I got.

I am running an i7 intel with a GTX 970, nothing spectactular, and am having zero, none, nada , issues!  I made sure my drivers were up to date, and immediately I was cookin' with gas. The worst thing for me are all the ""History Nazi's"" whinin', snivelin' and moanin' about this or that.  Pffftt.. is what I say. Also, there have been more than several ""BLM"" jobless wonders whinin and snivelin too..get over yourselves already.  It is a game! Play, and ENJOY something for a change, or at least go ask your mom upstairs if ewe can take out the trash for her, and while ewe are at it, throw your old PC out the window, and ask your mom for a loan and go get a decent computer, but above all...Quit Yer Whinin' Nancies!Fix Bayonet!!!

												Never again CODs from Sledgehammerthe last one was Advanced Warfare and it sucked, this one is even worse!!the singleplayer is so linear you aren't even playing, you are just killing some time(enemies)between each cutscene that happens every 5-10minutes, the whole D-Day is basically a walking-cutscene-walking-cutscene-shooting-cutscene etc.. let me play!!!the multiplayer has the FEWEST maps ever, and only 2 are good, I'm not joking, ask any COD forum, they all suck. did they even played the game? wtf? and the weapons omg... only 1 good weapon for class out of 3 choice, like I KNOW they want you to BUY more weapons with the supply drops but 1  pisol and 1 melee? seriously?  listen, I'm a COD veteran player, I've played every COD game ever and I've even enjoyed Black Ops 3 and Infinity warfare before the Season pass ruined it all with the Loot Boxes and split playerbases. so listen to my advice. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. if you like CODs.please. I'm so angry, I've waited long enough for a patch that never came, it still feels like I'm playing the f** BETA!!"

												Another COD, who would have guessed.Before all of you bandwagon passengers start spewing hate towards the game, I will urge you to at least play it before commenting. It is a different COD, one that tries to reconnect with its roots. Is it successful? Yeah, I think so.Is it ground breaking? Probably not, had it done some things differently it could have been great.Lets begin with the campaign. It isnt bad and it certainly has its good moments. In particular the mission where you infiltrate a German HQ in paris, meet up with a contact and blow up some key locations and then hell breaks loose. It is that type of gameplay narrative that is so well executed that its astonishing that they come so such low points in other levels. The variety of elements in the single player seems varied enough, much like the original COD game. Theres your initial blessed by fire moment, your stealth, your rail sequences, your sniping sections. All of that plus more if you are a fan of WWII games do not hesitate and give this game a go, even for the single player alone its worth the price. The sound design is passable, the graphics are well, good in some respects and controls what you expect. Its a solid choice!My biggest issue is the AI. Sometimes it seems, they will simply go away and die without you even fighting. You would think that your squad mates are doing the job, but when you look closely, they really arent. What makes the enemy AI die and stop fighting? I dont know. I call it programming. Once you figure out in which areas you can get away with this exploit it becomes redundant and not fun. However, Not all missions allow such bug to happen as some require you to either plan your movement through scripted areas or fight the hordes of german soldiers while being under a stopwatch.Unfortunately I cant say much about the multiplayer, which is where to me, it falls apart and to be honest I dont know where to begin.Maps are well designed but they are designed for a low player count which for most PC gamers is a dissapointment. the biggest maps allow 6v6 matches. The sizes of maps forces this low amount of players to be in constant action, I suppose that was their way to fix it, but its never epic. Spawn killing and other unfair events happens often which may hinder your chnaces to have fun.The level of authenticity is thrown out the window. I dont need to tell you how much it bothers me to watch female infantry troops in the fallschirmjager, Im sure you have heard enough of that by now so lets move on.Speaking of Authenticity.. well they have made some errors. Some weapons simply dont act like they should. Some lack some firepower while others carry modifications that were never intended for them. They treated the weapons in this game like a modern war game would treat theirs. By allowing it to be fully costumizable. I understand they do this for fun but god, I wish they stuck with the class based, faction based system. It would have made more sense than watching a black female SS soldeir with a PPSH-41.However, if you dont care about authenticity and are looking for quick mindless multiplayer action then COD offers that and it does it well.In short, I will recomend Call of Duty: WWII for anyone who loves historical games of that era and are craving for a more modernized World War II style of game. However, if you want something involding a deep multiplayer game then you have plenty of better options out there!my verdict 7/10Its a good game and dont let people tell you that its horrible just because of the COD tag."

												EDIT: I wanted to add that although I recommend the game, it does not have the grandeur that battlefield 1 has. But compared to the other most recent CODS, it is far more focused and feels like the original/iconic games, such as Modern Warfare and World at War.I do believe they missed a massive opportunity - the scale of fighting in mutliplayer and singleplayer is far too small. If they had made it of the scale of battlefield 1 on the beaches of normandy, it would have been 10x better.I highly recommend if you're looking for grandeur, purchase battlefield 1 instead. But if you're looking for a ""classic"" yet revamped version of the old Call of Duty's, then purchase this game.All I can say difinitively, is that I hope (since the developers refused to with this game) that battlefield comes out with a world war 2 game so we can get the grandeur this game is missing.Original Review:Ok first things first, most of the negative reviews are based on undeserved critisism. The game is critisized in places in shouldn't be, and isn't in places it should be.Campaign: PlotIn terms of the campaign, it is, for the most part, historically accurate. Each of the missions are realistic in the sense that what did happen was not over the top in terms of what could have actually happened during the second world war. From landing on normandy to the battle of the bulge, it sticks strictly to realism.Now, whether or not one likes the cinematic movie style feel, which is what they were going for, is a subjective and honest opinion. One shouldn't parade it as fact just because they like or don't like this game style. It's call of duty, if you expected it to be different, play 0.3 hours on record then come to complain in the reviews, what are you doing with your life?Campaign: Content/mechanicsThis is where people can justifiably critisize the campaign. Or so I thought. This is where the alleged historical inaccuracies began to show. On Normandy there were a few guns which didn't make too much sense such as the PPSH. FOR SOME REASON, people writing reviews thought that countries ONLY used guns that they created. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Germans used italian, Russian, British, and American styled guns during the war. America used German, British, and so on guns during the war. Same with the British and every other country during the war. So to those crying wolf at the Germans using Soviet guns, this is NOT historically inaccurate. I implore these people to do even some basic research on this.The Nazi officer uniforms were a tad off though. But overall, these were minor historical discrepencies in terms of hindering from the plot and accuracy of the campaign plotwise.The user also starts off with a standard 1911 pistol as well as the m1 garand in most cases, sticking to reality. The user also relies on his allies to heal or supply him with extra ammo, amongst other things, shying away from the self regeneration rambo styled player from the other call of duty games. American soldiers have and drop exclusively American guns, while the German soldiers have and drop exclusively German guns. One last thing I didn't like was with the Germans. The Germans sound cliche from what an American thinks they sound like, but they don't sound like a German German. The American soldier speaking German with the accent is fine though, I have no issue with that. Additionally, there is a huge difference between the Wehrmacht and the SS, one being the army and the other the deathsquad of the Nazi's who committed countless warcrimes and were brutal killers. Although there are few areas where this is blurred, it should not be blurred at all.MultiplayerTHIS IS WHERE MOST ACTUAL DESERVED CRITISISM  IS VALIDHackers and cheaters suck. I personally have not encountered many, but a lot of other people in the review section have. If mutliplayer is a huge aspect of the game for you and you can't deal with hackers, TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THE GAME. Weigh this as a pro and con against the campaign and nazi zombies. Now, in terms of other complains about it, some are justified and some aren't. To everyone wondering why there are black female germans on the axis, let alone male black germans, or those who were so mortified their hands began to tremble with fear, the creators of the game said they wanted to allow people to create a character that represents who they are and what they want their FICTIONAL character to be, regardless of if it is STRICTLY historically accurate. EVERY game like this, such as Battlefield 1, sacrifice SOME aspects of reality to add their own touch to the game. In World War One, trenchwarfare was the main style of warfare yet you run around in mutliplayer with a submachien gun (which were no where near as popular/available) as if its call of duty. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH EITHER OF THESE. It's just the creative direction the creators took to stick to their own unique style of game as well as making it more enticing to people.The guns, uniforms, and kill streaks are also grounded in reality, but again have their own call of duty esque twist to it.Nazi ZombiesZombies is a key component of call of duty, I can't complain much here. But, they did take out much of what made zombies zombies out of the game. The characters in the older versions were walking cliche's and had personality, now they are just random people. The atmosphere is also gone.If you want to challenge my review, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do so. BUT, make sure, when applicable, you have a DEEP understanding and not just a quick wikipedia search, of historical events. Or if it pertains to the German aspect, that you speak the language and understand the culture."

												So... bought it cause well, cause it's COD. I hated the futuristic flying through the air ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on the previous so figured this would be much better and 'down to earth'. Battlefield has been a favortie with its realism, physics, and destructive environment. This game has none of that. I figured even if this game was a clone it would still be better than that flying, wall running, futuristic garbage. Well.... I was wrong. If you make a copy of a copy, and so on a hundred times, you get this game. Online is small and dull, and the campaign is so linear and boring I wish I would have stopped trying to like this game over and over and simply refunded it."

Every scene is something you've already seen, every fire fight you get into is a fire fight you've been in before.  It's more of the same crap you've come to expect from the COD franchise.  It's a solid waste of $59.99 (or $99.99) if you opt for the ""I have no concept of money"" Edition.  I've never understood why they feel the need to completely direct EVERY SINGLE  MOVEMENT YOU MAKE.

												I just finished the campaign, mainly bought it for the SP experience. I usually dont use this word a lot, but i actually hated the game.There where shockingly many details that where historical incorrect. Weapons was the first thing i noticed, and from there the list got longer and longer until i felt that the developers had rewritten history in their own sick and twistet way. The story is cheesy and clishe without any depth, it didnt make me connect to anything in the game.For me there is no redemption after this, I am never going to buy another COD game.For me, this game is like taking a P**S on history:/"

												I truly enjoyed Call of Duty: WWII in Single Player Campaign. The game feels fast, fluid, responsive, and classic return of boots on the ground, though I did played Call of Duty way back in 2003. For performance-wise, PC version supports 250 frames per second in MP while goes beyond 250fps in SP Campaign. I was able to run between 200-250fps with GTX 1080 Ti in 1920 x 1080 Resolution. I don't experience crash at all. The characters and plot was interesting to learn; it captures heroism, belief, emotionalism, and also delivers powerful story which was inspired by true story back in World War II era. And of course, it's also inspired by popular TV series and Movies such as Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Redline, Hacksaw Ridge, etc.  I have still got more ways to go to complete the campaign, and then hop into MP and then some Zombie mode. Overall, I am glad that Sledgehammer Games, Raven Software, and Activision have listened to the PC community based on feedback from Steam Community, Twitter, and/or Reddit during the PC Open Beta on September 29th - October 1st, 2017, and will continue to make PC port great again! If you are huge fan of WWII First Person Shooter Game, I highly recommend ordering Call of Duty: WWII and enjoy the classic return of boots on the ground! Pros:-Game supports G-Sync/FreeSync-Unlocked framerate in SP while limited to 250fps in MP-Mouse Sensitivity Number Value (including) Slider-Supports 4:3, 16:9, 16:9, and 21:9-VRAM Usage Overcommitment-Graphics looks stunningly fantastic which is powered by heavily modified idTech (Quake) Engine-Supports High Resolution Mouse-Includes Raw-Mouse Input-High Tick-Rate Server (60Hz+) Support-In MP, game supports Dedicated Server-Gun sound mix was crisp, clear, and amazing-Dialogue was excellent-Character details look good-No Health Regeneration Mechanic in SP, though ask NPC to get First Aid Kit while MP, on the other hand, has Health Regeneration Mechanic-Mantle system was fast and responsive-Animation system was outstanding, and felt like you sprint what an actual rifleman carries firearm in the military -Delivers outstanding classic first person shooter WWII Military Theme-Campaign length time was about 6-7 hours longCons:-Some SLI users are having poor performance due to low GPU utilization-Some users report that screen flashes/flickers green when launching the game-Launching the game shows up black screen, and I had to press Alt+Tab to resume the game and now displays the image properly-In MP, there's no Dedicated Server Browser-Some people may say the game is not historically accurate which is not true. For instance, German carrying PPSH-41 on D-Day Mission. The German Nazis captured PPSH-41 and then converted & modified into Standard German Submachine Gun.

Multiplayer i kinda recommend and kinda not because Good side is good maps,fun maps,good guns and all that stuff but down side is that there are alot of hackers. i mean ALOT.. Multiplayer rating 7/10. But still Really fun. But since this game just came out like a month ago still needs some major bug fixes.... FPS still has some drops and all that like micheal bay kinda games.. For right now i have not completed the game because i forgot what misson it is but its like a tank one and stuff... when i flank it goes the same direction i go. and again i go the other way. still follows me. i don't know why its like that. but still like i said still needs some hacker detection. bug fixes all that stuff. i mean how much times have i said all that stuff. yeah i said it like 1000 times. so yeah hope this is a helpful review to you people who want to buy this game, and yeah if you get this game it will ttake a long time to download... takes like 3-2 hours. Really good game since i played this more often too still 9/10. zomebies holy shoot 8289727891278832/10.thank you hope this was  helpful."

												After a long hiatus of Call of Duty (last played CoD was Black Ops) I was pleasantly surprised by CoD WWII, and pleased I took the plunge buying it. Although the campaign is quite short the experience is very rich. Typical WW2 styles missions and objectives, set across the essential scenery’s that tick all the boxes, they played it safe, but it’s exactly what I was hoping for. Beach landing, check. Clocktower sniper watch, check. Boots on the ground, check.Graphically it can be stunning and performance matched. I was averaging 110fps, fully maxed at 1440p (GTX1080, i7-6700k, 16GB DDR4). In-game cutscenes are especially gorgeous and can sometime be hyper realistic. Music, voice acting and sound effects are all also incredible. Definitely would recommend this game."

												I purchased COD WWII even though I saw mixed reviews. Not being an diehard of COD, I figured I could be more forgiving than others who were negative. I played Metal of Honor WWII back in the day and absolutely loved it. Comparatively speaking, this game falls short.Bottom line, I wish I did not purchase. The game is very badly done. It wasn't worth my money and it wasn't worth my time. The game is less about WWII and more about a story line about a boy (the main character) and his brother hunting when he was just a boy. Brother defended the boy from getting attached by a wolf and the boy did not have the courage to shoot his gun....with attempts to correlate it to his real-time experience in war.I bought the game for WWII, not for a cheesy story. Very short game, I was done in under 11 hours. I think all of the money was spent trying to create a Hollywood film rather than a video game. And like everyone says, the graphics are poor. I didn't care for the Zombies either....everyone does zombies now days, it is very tired.There were a lot of bugs when I played. Likely they will get fixed, so don't fret too much over the bugs as it was an obvious rushed release."

												To break down what this game's multiplayer is:A point and click adventure disguised as an FPS (aka we won't bother to balance snipers properly so enjoy getting one shot by people you already had multiple bullets in.)A waiting game, in which you get to wait for your spawn to flip for an entire ten minutes unless you're playing Hardpoint. The maps get stale enough to make you believe they've been out since the time period this game's been loosely based on. kiddie casino (though out of all CoD games with lootboxes, this one probably has the best system for earning them. I'll give them that.)Cheater Gaming chair infestationI've played little of the campaign. Seems standard. Might go back and play more in hopes to feel like I had my money's worth. Probably won't be amazing, but something to waste some time on. Zombies is alright, I suppose.Save your money, or toss it in a bin and set it alight."

												So, I bought this game one whim. I was very unsure about it. I haven’t bought a Call of Duty game since Modern Warfare 3. I loved World At War. I actually very much like this one as well! For a call of duty game it doesn’t very well. I have played the campaign and it was surprisingly more emotional than I thought it would be. The missions were good and the game flows well. The weapons “feel” good, if that makes sense. Of course there are still some shady people online that are clearly cheating. Which they need to be harder on picking up cheaters and banning them for cheating to keep the chance of running into one super low. Plus people should just not be low life’s and play the game fairly. Zombies was fun and interesting. I played it and beat the main boss once and probably won’t really play it again. In the end I would recommend this to someone who liked the older Call of Duties."

												Call of Duty: World War 2 is the latest game in the Call of Duty franchise and is easily one of the worst I’ve played (for better reference, I skipped the games between Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 3 but have played all the others since Call of Duty 4).  I want to point out that I bought this game twice, once at launch where I found it completely unplayable due to an abundance of cheaters and♥♥♥♥♥♥matchmaking, I promptly got my steam refund.  They I was coax by a friend to purchase it during the steam winter sale.  This review is only for the multiplayer portion as the other two portions are uninteresting to me, but if all you want to play is the campaign I suggest buying World at War since it’s only $20 and it’ll take forever for this game to get to a price point for only a 6-hour multiplayer.  Plus, World at War is a way better game imo, but I digress on with the review.The heart of any CoD’s multiplayer experience is the maps, this game launched with 9 non-war maps. (10 if you count the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ preorder bonus map).  I like 2 of these maps: London Docks and Ardennes Forest.  While liking any map is based on personal preference and time spent playing that map, what cannot be denied is that this is the lowest number of multiplayer maps any CoD has shipped with.  While there are 3 additional maps, these are only for the games War mode and while I personally like it a lot of players are going to want to stick to Team Deathmatch and the other various game modes since they’re going to be more consistently populated.  Not to that the map Gustav Cannon is notorious for frame drops on PC, why they think such a wide-open map would work on the Quake 3 engine is beyond me.  Also, why the ♥♥♥♥ is this series still running on a modified Quake 3 engine, you make how much money each year and you can’t make a new engine for ♥♥♥♥s sakes. The other “map” for the multiplayer portion is the Headquarters, and ♥♥♥♥ me do I hate the headquarters.  I will admit a social hub is cool we all know that the only reason this is here is to push those♥♥♥♥♥♥loot boxes.  I’m not going to sit here and argue about how “their just cosmetic” or any other bull♥♥♥♥♥♥  All I’m going to say is I have had problems with gambling in the past and I get a very similar high opening these loot boxes that I did at the casino.  As a result, I find the concept of being able to view what other people get in a social hub very predatorial.  Stupid loot box crap aside, the headquarters is used to get contracts (for more loot boxes), prestige divisions and various mini games.  It’s also home to the Quartermaster waifu.  That aside, however I don’t understand what was wrong with previous games just putting it into a simple to use menu, with that I’d like to transition into the next topic…The UI, god does this game have a garbage UI.  Everything is buried into menus within other menus, and not to mention the god damn gun sounds that play with every option you click.  While this is a nitpick, it gets annoying really ♥♥♥♥ing quick.Speaking of sound let’s talk about that.  While the gun sounds in the menu are annoying as ♥♥♥♥, the gun sounds in game are pretty good, especially considering the plastic sounding weapons in Black Ops 3.  That’s about where the praise ends however, I find most of the call out deliveries to be mediocre performances at best and the various grunt and screams from being shot or set on fire to be cheesy.  I don’t wear a headset during playtime, but I’m told footsteps are easy to hear without the Mountain divisions perk of reduced noise.Mentioning the Mountain division feels like a good transition into the create a class system.  Gone is the pick 10 system that started in Black Ops 2 and now is this new, very♥♥♥♥♥♥division system. There are 5 divisions, Mountain, Airborne, Armored, Infantry and Expedition.  Each division has four levels and also corresponds to a particular weapon type, though you can use whichever division with whatever weapon you lose certain bonuses, such as: hold breath for snipers with Mountain, Rifle Bayonet with Infantry, SMG Suppressor with Airborne, Incendiary shells for shotguns with Expedition and a LMG bipod with Armored.  While there are 5 divisions Mountain and Infantry seem to be the most popular, Mountain because it provides invisibility from UAVs and eventually kill streaks (UAVs are as prominent in this game as they were in MW3) and Infantry because the Rifle Bayonet is OP as ♥♥♥♥ (I’ve personally gotten a super kill with it, for those not in the know that’s a 6 person kill or in other words I killed the entire enemy team with just a rifle bayonet) it also provides an extra attachment and an extra magazine but only 1 of those.  You might also see a few Airborne because it’s the only way to have a suppressor attachment, only for SMGs though, and it provides increased mobility. There’s also a few shotgun users who run Expedition as the fire shells are OP as ♥♥♥♥ on the Combat Shotgun post it’s buff and the only way to really get kills for all the other shotguns.  Armored is probably the least balanced division with it’s main draw being this games equivalent to Flak Jacket, or explosive resistance.  This however is only unlocked with tier 4 Armored while all the other divisions have their best perks at Tier 1.  Not only that but the resistance is inconsistent as ♥♥♥♥, to the point where I’ve died from grenades I wouldn’t have died from in previous games using flak jacket, but I stuck a ♥♥♥♥er with a sticky grenade and he did not ♥♥♥♥ing die.  Other then a division you also get a basic training, which is basically an extra perk.  This ranges from something that helps you reload faster, something that helps you see enemy names farther, etc.…  These are slightly more balanced in the sense that you actually have to make sacrifices in some instances but a select few are still far more powerful than others.The final portion of the class system is the weapon, and man does this game have some♥♥♥♥♥♥weapon balance.  The Bar is OP as ♥♥♥♥.  The FG42 shoots to slow post patch.  They said they want to buff the STG to be able to compete with the bar when the STG is easily top tier as it is.  The snipers have broken hit detection.  The SMGs are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥in comparison to the ARs.  The M1 Garand is a two-shot rifle at most distances but is has little to no recoil while it’s counterpart the SVT shoots slower and has a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton more recoil.  Certain LMGs, like the Lewis are fun to use and aside from the post buff combat shotgun the shotguns are garbage too.  The pistols are strong and that’s a good thing but the 1 hit melee needs to be balanced, refer to the super kill with a bayonet above.  While it is CoD and there is a certain level of bull♥♥♥♥♥♥tolerance you’ll need to play it, this game is high up on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t scale.Besides the unbalanced mess the game is it has a bigger problem, CHEATERS.  As I said above the game at launch was infested with cheaters, hell there were cheaters as early as the public beta.  I don’t understand why they though it was okay to launch without anti-cheat software, especially when Black Ops 3 had decent anti-cheat.  I’ve come to understand that they’re now manually banning players, but that’s too little too late.While cheaters are a problem they can’t be a problem if you can’t find a game.  Even in NA during prime hours I find many games where the lobbies aren’t full, or the lobby empties mid game and doesn’t refill.  I’ve also sat in pre-game lobbies for upwards of 10 minutes waiting for people to join, granted that usually only occurred whilst trying to play the War game mode, the only game mode I enjoy I think it’s important to bring up.Also where the ♥♥♥♥ are my twitch prime loot boxes, it's been like a ♥♥♥♥ing month..."

												so I must say going backwards in time makes cod feel fresh. no more lazer weapons, no more exosuits just old ww2 weapons and gear and it works (TO A POINT)STORY- I must say im not a fan of trying out multi player story modes but i think you need to give WW2 story a chance. It really gives you a perspective on how it was and how much people sacraficed as soldiers. The story is pretty lenghy about max 6hours if you play thoguh it once  but some missions were so good i played them twice like D-day. Over all the story gets a solid 7/10MULTIPLAYER-Well its as usual same fast pace kill kill die die which some people love but its a hit or miss for me. I think the ony great gmae mode is war. Its basically a game mode where you have many objectives like fueling a tank or defending certain points on the map. I love that game mode and each dlc is to have a new one coming can't wait for that. All the weapons feel good but of course some are better than others, Over all i give multiplayer a 5/10 its under averageZombies- Yep kill turn things on and off buy weapons same old same old. Must say map is pretty good just gets boaring after a while. ( David tennet is a voice actor and its great to hear him) AKA 11th docter from docter whoOverall i give it a 7/10 Its not perfect but im sure you weill get some enjoyment out of it. I would say get it on sale but you might be dead by the time that happens."

												I've been putting off Call of Duty for the last few installations of the series but this one was pretty decent.The campaign is short and sweet (around 7 hours or so) but it was fun enough to hold my interest for the whole thing in one sitting.The multiplayer is super simple and reminds me of older games but I think simplicity works out for this game.Call of Duty is just dumb, mindless fun every once in awhile. Its a series I just can't take seriously and in this case, that's a good thing. While I don't see myself playing it TOO much longer or buying any DLC, it was still good to go back to CoD for a minute.Not the GREATEST game EVER but I still had fun with the time I spent with it.7/10"

												Okay so I'm a Halo fan boy, I played competitive Game Battles for a little over three years and have since moved to Pc gaming. I've also played all CoD's and loved MW2, BO'2 +3, So I think I know what a decent CoD mp is. This is actually one of them. Haven't touched campaign yet so I wont comment on that. Mp is pretty good, the guns feel great, the maps aren't bad and proformence wise, I run an i5 7700 with 16gb ram and a 1070. This game runs like silk on my end. The servers are iffy and right now many are saying they are getting an error which doesn't alow them online, I got it last night. Servers aren't great but its a new release so you should expect that. Since BO'2 this is the next best mp from COD. If you enjoy the basic CoD machanics and like unlocking guns and doing all the challenges, this is for you. Micro Transactions are in this game but you can unlock everything without them and getting supply drops is fast and easy as hell to do. People who complain about frame drops, they just need better internet or a better rig imo.Pros - Quality graphicsGreat MPSolid feel to weaponsZombies is a hell of a lot of funSound quality is the best it's ever beenConstant updates to better the game Cons - Servers can suck (will be smoothed out in time)Micro Transactions (If that annoys you)"

 Review:     Multiplayer As Call of Duty: WWII is 'boots on the ground' it is a one of the better CoDs. The maps are decent as are the weapons however the snipers are quite overpowered and in most cases can beat SMGs even at close range. Apart from that the wepaons balancing is decent.The new addition of 'Divisions' and 'Basic Training' instead of perks was a risky but alright change as it doesn't affect the gameplay too much. Single Player As someone who usually doens't enjoy the single player in CoD, this one is an expection. There are many explosions, action packed and there is a story and you do 'some what' connect with the characters. One of the best single players. Overall Verdict     Graphics - 8/10Gameplay - 8/10Variety - 5/10 (It's an online FPS game, so what do you expect :) ) Final Verdict    I recommend this game whether you are new to the series or not. Not every game is filled with 'try hards'. Even the not best players can have the chances to earn scorestreaks."

VRAM usage was usually 80-90% of total VRAM at high settings. have the latest drivers for my video card but even then had to downgrade my settings to normal to eliminate lagging. - game concentrated more on aesthetics instead of delivering a great gaming experience like what COD modern warfare ii did for me before- there are missions where i have to report back to the squad leader several times which is frustrating to me IMO. i find this mission ""requirement"" to be silly and unnecessary. i want guns blazing kill the enemies get the glory atmosphere in an FPS game. i don't care about a stupid squad leader. - there are in game video clips w/c are so tiring to see bcoz they are overdramatized and take up a lot of time. the writers of this game probably thought they were writing a book but i'm expecting an FPS game where i'm entertained FPS style. i want short video clips and i want it fun. if i wanted drama i'd watch a war movie. - zombie single-player mode wasn't that fun to play at all. left 4 dead was better.  my recommendation- don't buy this game. buy battlefield 1 instead w/c is tons of fun to play with"

Save yourself some money purchase it when it goes on sale.SP is really good esp if you have a beast computer.MP is a good challenge CAMPERS vs HACKERS vs SPAWNKILLERSLike any cod it has its ups and down.

As for the hackers in multiplayer I've only encountered a few in my playtime."

												Call of Duty: WWII, a game we've all been waiting to go back to. I loved going back to play some of the older CoDs that didn't have any futuristic weapons or armor. Sadly, there aren't enough people who go back to those older CoDs. So, thanks for Sledgehammer, we can finally have lobbies full of players while playing ""boots on the ground."" People loved the old way of CoD and now we have it again. This is the set and stone for the future of CoD and it will continue to get better.Call of Duty: WWII brings back a ""boots on the ground"" experience with very rich and emotional campaign.

												All i can say is ♥♥♥♥ this game. I have not played a COD multiplayer since MW2 and i dont ever remember having the trouble this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥is having. Have had no end of issues trying to connect with multiple error codes. Its not like activison does not know how many people will be buying the game so why cant they release it in a working state? Also love how♥♥♥♥♥♥the peer to peer is on the game, kill cams are always a treat when on the enemy feed you are in the open but on your screen you are completely behind a wall. All and all just not really an acceptable game for the year 2017. It is fun when its working and i can forgive most of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in the game but the fact that multiplayer has been ♥♥♥♥ed since release with errors connecting i would stay away and wait for a sale, or better yet get it on a key site and hope activison does not see a dime of the money.UPDATE: it seems that they have finally fixed the cluster flop of server issues. I enjoy the game very much. I have only really played for any extent of time the war mode as i find the maps on the other modes in MP pretty aweful. With only three maps i am recomending the game so again i find it to be a great throw back to the old days of COD glory"

												I know the COD franchise had a flop, but this one is pure gold. You gotta try it out. For real, it's probably one of the best COD's ever made up to now. Really enjoyable, takes time to adapt and get used to the kind of gameplay that it offers(Not to mention all the COD veterans that play it 24/7). But yeah, you should give it a try that's for sure. I've been disappointed by COD AW and COD IW, but this one really comes back to what we wanted during this whole time. Back to the roots folks."

												STOP! Do not buy this game. I, for one, loved the Beta but had a bad experience with cheaters/hackers at the end of it. I decided to go ahead and buy the game anyway. The Devs promised to handle the cheaters and unfortunately, I believed them. Well, they didn't.This morning, out of 5 games, 4 had someone cheating. I am talking, 90-5, trolling and taunting type of cheaters. I reported them all, but frankly don't believe the Devs will do anything about it. It's sad because it's too lad to refund, so I am begging you, DO NOT BUY this game unless you like single player. Multiplayer on PC is right now a 80% chance you will find a cheater on the other side, sometimes on your team, but it's still not fun."

												The singleplayer game mode is decent. The multiplayer aspect of this game lacks originality. The biggest nail in COD WWII's coffin is the lag. You can sit behind a man and shoot him for days and not get a hit marker. It's less about who is better or who shot first and it seems it's all about who has a better connection. This all depends on the servers being up, which they often go down. If I could get my $100 back I would. Dont waste your time on this salt factory full of toxic children and faulty lag compensation when there are far better games out there."

												First off let me get multiplayer out of the way: It is CoD MP.... it is exactually what you expect. I've not played CoD multiplayer since MW3 minus some drunk gaming nights with friends in Ghosts most recently but probably less than 3 hours on that.Zombies are eh, zombies. Single Player...Holy Heck...........The story was well writen, quicktime doesn't feel like it is 80% of the game and I got a good 5 hours out of it with the first play through.  I felt there were moments that my choices actually effected the outcome of a mission (Not sure if that is true or not) and I'll probably play through it again in hopes of getting all the collectables. I really enjoyed it and it hurts me to say this but, I have to give single player an 8/10.  I'd like it to be longer but what they have felt great regardless"

												The multiplayer is amazing and the singleplayer issnt half as bad as everyone makes it out to be.Singleplayer first:Pros:There is a good mix of straight up shootout, sneaking, sniping, driving and even flying. Also the objecitves change enough in their nature to keep it intersting.Cons:The games fails to show the horrors of WW2 and doesn't do the history justice.If you care about that than this will annoy you.Multipalyer:Pros:Great mapdesign. I want to write that in here tree times, but twice will have to do: Great mapdesign!The Gamemodes are fun and plenty, ranging from classics like ctf and domination to the ""war"" mode where teams have to complete a series of objectives.I like the progression system as well, it gives players who will invest alot of time in this game something to fight for and look forward to while also beeing somewhat optional since there are no game changing rewards at the end of the so called ""Prestige"". Yes it gives more flexibility by giving more loadout slots but in my opinion only a player who spends alot of time in cod: wwII will need/utilise that anyway.Cons:The Game is still somewhat unstable, for me it has not been game breaking, but it crashes fairly often, hopefully this will be patched soon.No ranked play available."

												I bought it for the nostalgia of playing COD.  I am only referring to the online multiplayer in this review.It's ok.  I haven't played COD since BlOps 2 so I never saw any of the space age boost jumping stuff, so my frame of reference is to some of the earlier games in the series.Quick scoping is still terrible and should be removed from the game.  Snipers in general should be nerfed since it seems like the hit boxes are freaking massive.  Besides that, the connection is laggy as hell and there's sometimes so much stuttering that it makes some matches a real headache to finish.  And yes, I have pretty good internet at 65mbps down, which is more than sufficient for playing games.Anyway, I would pick it up if you really REALLY love COD and want to get in on it early on when there are still a lot of people playing.  I personally, I was merely curious.  It is still fun and engaging, but man... it feels like so little has changed since I played it all those years ago.  Even the graphics are very unimpressive when you look at other releases this year.  You would think they would have changed SOMETHING but this feels like a re-skinned version of older COD games.Know what you're getting into."

												It's pretty bad.The servers are trash. There's always an annoying bug (like the one that randomly resets reload animations), and this game somehow has way more cheaters than other CoD games do.The weapon variety is lacking too. No revolvers? Minor detail, but it irks me that a WW2 themed game leaves out revolvers and the Mosin Nagant.And don't even get me started on Contracts. They're the only way to get crates without paying money. (The crate drops are also pretty disappointing, even the ""epic"" ones, but that's just what I think)Problem is, they sometimes don't even WORK. I took on two ""get [amount] kills"" contracts at the same time, one for 45 and another for 25. The 45 one was completed, and the 25 one was stuck at THREE for some reason. So basically a kill counter of all things can't even properly be implemented."

												I'll preface this by saying that I haven't played the single-player.. and most of what I'm going to say won't pertain to that aspect of the game.I've spent roughly 50 hours playing multi-player, and for the first couple of weeks, I had a great time.  Especially with the war game mode.  My only complaint with that being that I wish there were more maps/operations.  But when I'm in the mood for a quick break from work, or have limited time, I'll often jump into a round of TDM.  Usually it's not a problem, I have a little fun and get back to doing whatever is I need to be doing.  But over the past few weeks.. it's become more of a frustration.  At first, it was one cheater every so often, but more often than not, I'd just leave the game and find a new one, no skin off my back.  It seems that in the past week all of that has changed.  I'm not one to quickly call someone a cheater or hacker because they're frequently killing me, or better at the game than I am, but this morning, I've attempt to play four rounds of TDM, three of them had people blatantly using an aimbot and/or wallhacks.  Let that sink in.  Three out of four.  75% of the games played this morning where my experience was effectively ruined.If you can get enjoyment out of a game where you'll only have a decent game 25% of the time, then yes, I guess it's worth it.  Or if you plan on using said aimbots/wallhacks, as Sledgehammer doesn't seem to want to do anything about it.But that's not what I payed $60 for."

Call of Duty: WW2First of all I want to say that this will be an review that will get updated very often!This game runs better then any other single CoD game, very smooth! Butter Smooth, no connectivity issues (people with VPN will encounter that)Map Info9 maps for standard gamemodes3 for the gamemode War1 with SP: CarentanSo now I'll start telling about my opinion so far.CampaignI haven't played it yet, but what people say about Axis using PPSH, I will give a quick explanation.The Axis has fought and won land in Russia, when they shot the soldiers to death they looted their bodies and took the weapons with them. They exported those to the West Front. There they made a few changes to the gun. They have used it against the Alies. MultiplayerThis is where the funs starts, you can do alot more then just playing matches.PerformanceThis game runs butter smooth for me, I don't encounter any problems at all, tweaked a few things in the Graphical settings to make it more smoother then it was before.No lagg, FPS drops or stuttering.Connectivity can be a little bit of a problem for some people. People who use VPN can have it difficult. I reccomend that you use a wired connection for the best. Open up your ports, same ports as any other CoD.HQCoD Introduces you to a new place where peopel can meet others, I really like this idea.Multiple things you can do:- Open loot boxes (people can watch you opening :D) I already ran into little kids screaming around.- Playing shootout with randoms, will earn you some Xp and some ingame currency- Playing a 1v1 match with random classes, I won my first by using rocketlaunchers only :P- Making Emblems, Paintjobs or other things- Gunsmith (Coming Soon)- Mail, here you can get you ingame currency. Every 4hrs you get 100.- Or just some Contracts/Orders. There are many to complete and will give you amazing stuff.Loot BoxesOh no! Here we go again?Nope!Different then before, you can earn them or you try to earn as much ingame currency to get you beloved item. No stat changing weapons. Some xp drops will hapen though like in AW.WarA new gamemode, its an objective and I have played some matches already. The only downside is that there are people that don't know what to do and they just getting kills.I like the operation on Omaha Beach. That one is fun (I'm not gonna tell any spoilers on that)Teamwork is the best!ZombiesAh shiit, doesn't look good? Treyarch simply is the best?Nah mate, I won't say that so often, it's a pretty good mode though.The zombies comes with 2 maps:- Prologue (Introducing you to the story and the characters.- The Final Reich (The real map where all the fun happens)They put alot of effort in it, I still think that this is the easiest zombies I have known. Round 30 feels like round 15 on Origins. But the bosses are really badass on high rounds.Prepare to have alot of Jumpscares too!My Opinion & RatingAs from what I've seen and I have playedThis game is worth you money's. Wait with purchasing SP though!Graphical Rating8/10Gameplay7,5/10Zombies7,5/10Feel free to ask any questions, I'll try to answer them as quick as possible or add me as friend on steam!--Edit 14-12-2017--Not reccomended since cheating is a big issue right now, Sledgehammer is trying to cover it by deleting hack posts on twitter, forums and more.Zombies is also broken, full with bugs...."

"Posted: December 6, 2017",Recommended,8.4 hrs on record,"Posted: December 6, 2017
												(Multiplayer only) Verdict: 6/10 - Neutral Recommendation. It's...okay. It's playable, and decent fun, but I really wouldn't call it anything special. There are only 9 multiplayer maps for the regular modes, and 3 for war, which is pretty sparse for a premium game driven by it's multiplayer experience. The gun play is alright, but the hit detection felt wonky to me at times. That could be due to lag, my skill level or an actual facet of the game, but the gun play felt off to me. Most of the guns felt like useless garbage, and there seems to be no advantage to using semi-auto rifles versus full auto. If you really liked quickscoping with the Intervention back in MW2, then you'll like this game. Sniping is kind of OP at anything outside of close quarters, and even then you do alright. The shotguns are worthless, and so are most of the rifles except for the STG and BAR, which are basically lazer guns. SMGs are okay, and the LMGs don't feel all that useful. I really think the lack of maps, and the overall map design quality is really what brings this game down a notch for me. A lot of the maps feel like reskinned versions of other maps we've already played. USS Texas is just the ship map from BO2. Anyone who has played most of the previous Call of Duty games will find that most of the maps remind them a bit too strongly of another map from a previous game. So all in all, almost none of the map content feels original or new, and the variety is pretty bad. Most of the maps are small, with little room for tactical maneuevring. I'm almsot positive that this game could have probably shipped with atleast 5 more maps, but I bet those were sectioned off for the first scheduled DLC, which is frustrating. Overall, this game is okay if you really like CoD or are a quickscoper. It's decent, but really not that amazing. I'm personally going to return in after a few hours of gameplay, and this is coming from someone who has played almost every CoD since CoD3. I had fun, but not a ton of fun."

There are also a lot of laggy servers and i know it wasnt my ping because it was fully green and i still lagged and i would lose the gun fight because of it. also the shotguns on here are ♥♥♥♥ing useless because it takes almost 3 shots with a shotgun from 5 centimeters away and it just pisses me off that a sniper can 1 shot at someones ♥♥♥♥ing big toe, ffs can i get an fps game that isnt ♥♥♥♥ing broken and made by absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.This is quiz signing off see youj next time.

												Bought this game just recently. Download was 20GB plus for single player and another 20GB plus for multiplayer. stuff i didn't like- have a gtx 1060 3GB / 32gb RAM / core i5 but experienced some lagging. VRAM usage was usually 80-90% of total VRAM at high settings. have the latest drivers for my video card but even then had to downgrade my settings to normal to eliminate lagging. - game concentrated more on aesthetics instead of delivering a great gaming experience like what COD modern warfare ii did for me before- there are missions where i have to report back to the squad leader several times which is frustrating to me IMO. i find this mission ""requirement"" to be silly and unnecessary. i want guns blazing kill the enemies get the glory atmosphere in an FPS game. i don't care about a stupid squad leader. - there are in game video clips w/c are so tiring to see bcoz they are overdramatized and take up a lot of time. the writers of this game probably thought they were writing a book but i'm expecting an FPS game where i'm entertained FPS style. i want short video clips and i want it fun. if i wanted drama i'd watch a war movie. - zombie single-player mode wasn't that fun to play at all. left 4 dead was better.  my recommendation- don't buy this game. buy battlefield 1 instead w/c is tons of fun to play with"

												Okay so I'm a Halo fan boy, I played competitive Game Battles for a little over three years and have since moved to Pc gaming. I've also played all CoD's and loved MW2, BO'2 +3, So I think I know what a decent CoD mp is. This is actually one of them. Haven't touched campaign yet so I wont comment on that. Mp is pretty good, the guns feel great, the maps aren't bad and proformence wise, I run an i5 7700 with 16gb ram and a 1070. This game runs like silk on my end. The servers are iffy and right now many are saying they are getting an error which doesn't alow them online, I got it last night. Servers aren't great but its a new release so you should expect that. Since BO'2 this is the next best mp from COD. If you enjoy the basic CoD machanics and like unlocking guns and doing all the challenges, this is for you. Micro Transactions are in this game but you can unlock everything without them and getting supply drops is fast and easy as hell to do. People who complain about frame drops, they just need better internet or a better rig imo.Pros - Quality graphicsGreat MPSolid feel to weaponsZombies is a hell of a lot of funSound quality is the best it's ever beenConstant updates to better the game Cons - Servers can suck (will be smoothed out in time)Micro Transactions (If that annoys you)"

												The singleplayer game mode is decent. The multiplayer aspect of this game lacks originality. The biggest nail in COD WWII's coffin is the lag. You can sit behind a man and shoot him for days and not get a hit marker. It's less about who is better or who shot first and it seems it's all about who has a better connection. This all depends on the servers being up, which they often go down. If I could get my $100 back I would. Dont waste your time on this salt factory full of toxic children and faulty lag compensation when there are far better games out there."

												Single Player: 3/5Multiplayer: 3.5/5Zombies: 4/5Overall: 3.5/5 Good Call of Duty World War 2 returns to the boots on the ground gameplay COD was built on. The campaign is a typical walk down hall ways, kills mobs, watch some cutscenes experience. Nothing special, nothing terrible. This game shines in the multiplayer department. The multiplayer experience is overall very solid. Not an instant classic, but a solid game to play with pals. It falls short only from an overall lack of maps. Zombies is perhaps the best part of the new cod. The easter egg objective system of present in BOPS 3 is fleshed out, and feels like a natural part of the experience. The gameplay remains strong and consistent and does not fail to disappoint despite being made by sledgehammer. Overall a good cod game, perahaps the best of the generation."

												Call of Duty: WWII, a game we've all been waiting to go back to. I loved going back to play some of the older CoDs that didn't have any futuristic weapons or armor. Sadly, there aren't enough people who go back to those older CoDs. So, thanks for Sledgehammer, we can finally have lobbies full of players while playing ""boots on the ground."" People loved the old way of CoD and now we have it again. This is the set and stone for the future of CoD and it will continue to get better.Call of Duty: WWII brings back a ""boots on the ground"" experience with very rich and emotional campaign. The multiplayer has tons of items to play with, as well as zombies. Zombies brings a horrific and terrific ride with jumpscares, as well as buildups."

												This game is already infected by tremendous amount of cheaters. People are reaching maximum prestige within just weeks using various hacks while Sledgehammer games doesn't give a $h!t about it. They are clearly not monitoring the game even on a very basic level, and their communication about its future is close to zero. Yeah, the game does include loot boxes, but the content is pure garbage. Weapon grips? Really? Who the f*ck cares about cosmetic things which you can't even see during gameplay. That's ridiculous! Worst filler I've ever seen in video games. The game, especially the multiplayer part, feels as a hollow, hasty, unfinished product."

												Port ranges for status queries (outgoing)Please do not make any port areas for your server queries. Some have a firewall and prevent the interception of large port areas in the outgoing traffic.This makes the game unplayable and you are constantly flying from the server. Please limit the queries to some fixed ports in outbound traffic for the server status queries. The same game has already made ARMA 2 with the steam integration. And has completely failed until Steam has switched back to the old known ports. So it is completely unplayable in monent and I will not open my ports in the firewall for a badly configured game.

Multiplayer i kinda recommend and kinda not because Good side is good maps,fun maps,good guns and all that stuff but down side is that there are alot of hackers. i mean ALOT.. Multiplayer rating 7/10. But still Really fun. But since this game just came out like a month ago still needs some major bug fixes.... FPS still has some drops and all that like micheal bay kinda games.. For right now i have not completed the game because i forgot what misson it is but its like a tank one and stuff... when i flank it goes the same direction i go. and again i go the other way. still follows me. i don't know why its like that. but still like i said still needs some hacker detection. bug fixes all that stuff. i mean how much times have i said all that stuff. yeah i said it like 1000 times. so yeah hope this is a helpful review to you people who want to buy this game, and yeah if you get this game it will ttake a long time to download... takes like 3-2 hours. Really good game since i played this more often too still 9/10. zomebies holy shoot 8289727891278832/10.thank you hope this was  helpful."

												After a long hiatus of Call of Duty (last played CoD was Black Ops) I was pleasantly surprised by CoD WWII, and pleased I took the plunge buying it. Although the campaign is quite short the experience is very rich. Typical WW2 styles missions and objectives, set across the essential sceneryâs that tick all the boxes, they played it safe, but itâs exactly what I was hoping for. Beach landing, check. Clocktower sniper watch, check. Boots on the ground, check.Graphically it can be stunning and performance matched. I was averaging 110fps, fully maxed at 1440p (GTX1080, i7-6700k, 16GB DDR4). In-game cutscenes are especially gorgeous and can sometime be hyper realistic. Music, voice acting and sound effects are all also incredible. Definitely would recommend this game."

												Bought this game just recently. Download was 20GB plus for single player and another 20GB plus for multiplayer. stuff i didn't like- have a gtx 1060 3GB / 32gb RAM / core i5 but experienced some lagging. VRAM usage was usually 80-90% of total VRAM at high settings. have the latest drivers for my video card but even then had to downgrade my settings to normal to eliminate lagging. - game concentrated more on aesthetics instead of delivering a great gaming experience like what COD modern warfare ii did for me before- there are missions where i have to report back to the squad leader several times which is frustrating to me IMO. i find this mission ""requirement"" to be silly and unnecessary. i want guns blazing kill the enemies get the glory atmosphere in an FPS game. i don't care about a stupid squad leader. - there are in game video clips w/c are so tiring to see bcoz they are overdramatized and take up a lot of time. the writers of this game probably thought they were writing a book but i'm expecting an FPS game where i'm entertained FPS style. i want short video clips and i want it fun. if i wanted drama i'd watch a war movie. - zombie single-player mode wasn't that fun to play at all. left 4 dead was better.  my recommendation- don't buy this game. buy battlefield 1 instead w/c is tons of fun to play with"

												I love everything about  World War II so I was magnetically drawn to this game because I love WWII.  I read proabably 350-400 reviews (mostly negative) and still decided to purchase this game thinking it was just biased reviews against COD games.NOPE!Completely unbiased.  It's a joke of a game.  It's just another COD game except they changed what the voices say, the surroundings and the models of the guns.  Everything else is the same.  I played it 3.5 hours and I didn't even feel like I was in the 1940's.  Activision was very kind to give me a full refund even though I exceeded the 2 hour gameplay limit just because I was so unhappy with the game.  So props to them, but other than that...Call of Duty: World War II is a steaming pile of dogs**t.  I'm sure it will still be very popular with every 12-14 year old in America though which will give them enough sales to continue to make this crap while overlooking actual good games by new developers that could be the next big thing.If you're a WWII buff, go to your local library and read up about it.  It's a million times better than this dumpster fire!Sincerely,Optimuse KevTron"

												This game is a real mixed bag. I have alot of fun playing the multiplayer, especially when doing well. However the game has alot of problems. Only 9 proper maps at release, including some that are barely worth playing such as USS Texas. The game is also riddled with incentives for microtransactions and the game is now so full of dlc content that loot boxes are far more likely to give you useless junk.

												(This is my first COD experience since BLACK OPS 2 and MW3)(I have over 90 hours in the Multiplayer but for some reason the review says 2.9 which must be campaign)1.

Lots and lots of connection issues5. Zombies...even with the nice objectives which do give it a plus, the power up sounds/voices are gone which was a really good part about all other zombies, the characters are sub par compared to the ones from black ops 1 (imo the best zombies experience) The game gets a little repetitive6. The multiplayer is pretty good but it feels as though that 8/10 times I die, the kill cam shows somethging completely different from what I saw (for example, I get the first 1-2 shots off on someone and die. Killcam shows they had the first 1-2 shots on me)"

People that I've reported and sent evidence haven't been banned yet. Story/Campaign-------------------Positives- Generic war story, but still really enjoyable.- Attaching characteristics - Gameplay features (healing, getting ammo etc) is interestingNegatives- Short for a COD campaignMultiplayer-------------------Positives- War mode is great.- Enjoyable doing contracts and side challenges in HQ- Class customisation is great- Content from loot crates are great as they're only cosmetic so micro-transaction aren't as bad (yet)Negative- Hackers, not a lot but they're there. Encounted 1 in lets say 3 out of 10 different lobbies. Blatent ones anyway.- The XP rate is cut in half related to other CODs, so it takes ages to level up without double XP.- Only 9 maps in the map rotation on normal playlists, War having 3 maps.- If you get loot crates, prepare to be disappointment. There are so many types of grips for your pistol, you'll be getting them a lot.- Console is more loved then PC (who would of thought after previous CODs). We don't have a Emblem Editor until 8th December and consoles already have it.Zombies----------------Positives- For first map, it's really cool and enjoyable- Easter egg is fun, easy to do. - Hard easter egg is challenging but is good to keep the map interesting until the new maps come out- Hidden challenges to unlock hidden characters- Prologue is cool- Different types of zombies is a great varietyNegatives-None that I can think ofOverallThe game is fun and worth a shot at playing, although I would hold of on buying season pass with it and not pay full price for it until they fix some bugs and maybe add some more content.Will edit if anything else springs to mind."

												I'm not going to lie, looking around at all the negatrive reviews reminds me why CoD developers gave up on PC in general, you people are extremely hard to please. Trying to get you guys not to give a bad review simply because of a gun sound is hard enough. Overall I believe this game really did come back to the CoD roots. The way it feels, the controls, the classes, the playlists, almost all of it, I can say make it feel like a CoD game again. Some things still need tinkering, but it's the first month of release, almost every game has needed a balancing period in the first month (look at R6: Siege, a lot of people still think it needs balancing). Sledgehammer came out with a game that, personally, rekindled my love for CoD that I lost after MW2.Campaign:Well, the campaign could have been better, it was a little short, and seemed a bit rushed towards the end. However, if I were to say that during the campaign I wasn't on the edge of my seat, anticipating every cutscene, every wave of enemies, I would be lying. I got super into the campaign, I might of even thought it was very short because I sat down for a couple hours and just ran through it without batting an eye.Multiplayer:Yes, cheating is still a thing. It's very minimal compared to other CoDs, but it is there. I've noticed that these accounts (if you report them via. their steam profile) get banned very quickly. The MP feels very similar to other CoD games. It feels like, personally, this is the first game to not have stopping power and still feel like a good old CoD game. The MP flows well, every game type is a new experience and, of course, with the change to scorestreaks, they really do give the incentive to play to win the game, not frag out and be useless for your team (much needed in CoD since the old days, happy when they brought it in a couple years ago).New Divisions/Customization:These classes feel great, no more perks, just attachments and one ""basic training"" (essentially a perk). Essentially your entire class stems from your division (Airborne, Armored, Infantry, Mountain, Expeditionary). As you level them up, you'll gain more perks (kind-of) for the specific type of gun they are meant for. So for Airborne, they specialize in SMGs, they allow you to suppress your SMG and the perks involved including running faster and for longer periods of time (think Marathon/Lightweight, mainly used on SMG classes!!). Overall, all the thought put into the divisions, basic trainings and attachments blended well in the game, creating a great feeling MP. The customization they added is a pure bonus, being able to change my classes' uniforms and changing the skins on my weapons from crates, as well as earning camos and skins through challenges is quite fun.Microtransactions:The only thing you can spend CP on currently is crates and rare crates (as well as the starter bundle). These are purely aesthetic, they don't give you an advantage in the game (unlike Star Cards, if comparing to SW:BF II). This game does NOT promote microtransactions for gameplay, but much like CS:GO, promotes it for the aesthetic value of the skins/uniforms.Challenges:As well as the typical CoD challenges (typical Killer, Humiliation, Game Mode challenges, etc), we were introduced to something called ""orders"". This is probably one of the greatest thing a CoD game has had implemented in it (as well as contracts). Being able to work towards an objective for bonus exp, a supply drop, or more, starts really making you focus on the gameplay. I never find myself running around in games bored, as I'm always going for a challenge, whether it be a weekly challenge for 200 explosive kills, or it's a daily for 10 headshots with a rifle, you'll always be working towards something."

												The game is slow, and full of hackers. 1st day and had seen so many hackers. The actions are slow. you can shoot to the left or right of people and still hit them. You get stuck often and delayed of action when pushing a button.This game vs battlefield 1 straight up sucks and is not worth the money I spent on it. Battlefield 1 wins on graphics, speed, input action. I would also like to play with more then 12 people. It would be nice to be in a game of 32 to 64 people. As of all the COD games for the last few years it is far lacking in may area's. Also steam is slow to vac ban and get hackers gone.I will play the game, but it is another wasted purchase on steam. If I could after 1st day, I would get my money back.I don't like how the cod ranking works either. it is like a arcade game from the 90's. Battlefeild 1 has a better ranking then cod straight up."

												i feel this game has a bucnh of ♥♥♥♥♥ creators because they wont put the swastikas in the multiplayer but they put it in singleplayer, this is a history game, i feel the battlefield creators wouldve put in the swastikas because they want it to feel authentic. after playing for a while i found that most of the guns are broken like the bar and kar98 and i felt like it made the game unblalanced. There are also a lot of laggy servers and i know it wasnt my ping because it was fully green and i still lagged and i would lose the gun fight because of it. also the shotguns on here are ♥♥♥♥ing useless because it takes almost 3 shots with a shotgun from 5 centimeters away and it just pisses me off that a sniper can 1 shot at someones ♥♥♥♥ing big toe, ffs can i get an fps game that isnt ♥♥♥♥ing broken and made by absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.This is quiz signing off see youj next time.

I have played 3 games and encountered a hacker in each. The game has been released for 2 weeks and has already become a cheater central game, the servers are terrible and I get d synced more than I do in Pubg. The only aspect of this game I find playable is the zombies, but unfortunatley 75% of the game is utter crap. I wouldnt reccomend this game to anyone"

												Single Player Review Only: I do not write many reviews. I chose to write something for CODWWII because it is th first COD Sinlge player game that had a story that actually meant anything to me since COD 2. I mean the actual sequel.  I stopped likeing COD around COD4, and then got back into in around BO. Only for the single player. I missed some decent stuff in between, the on rails stuff was not my thing for a while.At any rate, this game was good. If I would be critical I would say the second quarter of the game dragged a bit, but it was mainly to give you a different taste and some exposition. I enjoyed all of it, but the main or core story was actually decent. Sure it had its cheese, but I would not say any cheesier than Saving Private Ryan or any Clint Eastwood war picture. As a mature single player gamer I would highly recommend it and I am glad I did not wait for it to come down in price, which honestly takes forever for Activision, if at all. Also I think this is a Sledgehammer game, and I have been waiting for them to do something better since that one Wolf MP game. Unless i am wrong about that, which I probably am."

I usually dont use this word a lot, but i actually hated the game.There where shockingly many details that where historical incorrect. Weapons was the first thing i noticed, and from there the list got longer and longer until i felt that the developers had rewritten history in their own sick and twistet way. The story is cheesy and clishe without any depth, it didnt make me connect to anything in the game.For me there is no redemption after this, I am never going to buy another COD game.For me, this game is like taking a P**S on history:/"

Not sure why people are calling this a console port.  To me it feels as much a COD game as the first and this will likely throw off the jump/prone players."

												I truly enjoyed Call of Duty: WWII in Single Player Campaign. The game feels fast, fluid, responsive, and classic return of boots on the ground, though I did played Call of Duty way back in 2003. For performance-wise, PC version supports 250 frames per second in MP while goes beyond 250fps in SP Campaign. I was able to run between 200-250fps with GTX 1080 Ti in 1920 x 1080 Resolution. I don't experience crash at all. The characters and plot was interesting to learn; it captures heroism, belief, emotionalism, and also delivers powerful story which was inspired by true story back in World War II era. And of course, it's also inspired by popular TV series and Movies such as Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Redline, Hacksaw Ridge, etc.  I have still got more ways to go to complete the campaign, and then hop into MP and then some Zombie mode. Overall, I am glad that Sledgehammer Games, Raven Software, and Activision have listened to the PC community based on feedback from Steam Community, Twitter, and/or Reddit during the PC Open Beta on September 29th - October 1st, 2017, and will continue to make PC port great again! If you are huge fan of WWII First Person Shooter Game, I highly recommend ordering Call of Duty: WWII and enjoy the classic return of boots on the ground! Pros:-Game supports G-Sync/FreeSync-Unlocked framerate in SP while limited to 250fps in MP-Mouse Sensitivity Number Value (including) Slider-Supports 4:3, 16:9, 16:9, and 21:9-VRAM Usage Overcommitment-Graphics looks stunningly fantastic which is powered by heavily modified idTech (Quake) Engine-Supports High Resolution Mouse-Includes Raw-Mouse Input-High Tick-Rate Server (60Hz+) Support-In MP, game supports Dedicated Server-Gun sound mix was crisp, clear, and amazing-Dialogue was excellent-Character details look good-No Health Regeneration Mechanic in SP, though ask NPC to get First Aid Kit while MP, on the other hand, has Health Regeneration Mechanic-Mantle system was fast and responsive-Animation system was outstanding, and felt like you sprint what an actual rifleman carries firearm in the military -Delivers outstanding classic first person shooter WWII Military Theme-Campaign length time was about 6-7 hours longCons:-Some SLI users are having poor performance due to low GPU utilization-Some users report that screen flashes/flickers green when launching the game-Launching the game shows up black screen, and I had to press Alt+Tab to resume the game and now displays the image properly-In MP, there's no Dedicated Server Browser-Some people may say the game is not historically accurate which is not true. For instance, German carrying PPSH-41 on D-Day Mission. The German Nazis captured PPSH-41 and then converted & modified into Standard German Submachine Gun. Thus, doing extensive WWII history research is a must!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPSh-41-Some people are sexists against female character in Multiplayer-No Mod Tools SupportSystem Spec:Intel Core i7 7700K 5Ghz 1.35V VCore Adaptive/(LLC/Vdroop Lvl 2)MSI Gaming M7 Z270  MotherboardNoctua NH-D15 CPU Air CoolerNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB GDDR5X Video Card OC@ 147Mhz+ Core/485Mhz+ MemoryG.Skill TridentZ RGB 32GB 3866MhzMhz CAS 18-19-19-39 DDR4 SDRAM 1.35V VCCSA 1.24V/ VCCIO 1.25VLogitech G910 Orion Spark RGB Romer-G Mechanical KeyboardLogitech G903 Lightspeed Ambidextrous Wireless Gaming MouseLogitech Z333 2.1 Stereo SpeakerLogitech Powerplay Wireless Charging System Cloth/Hard Mouse PadLogitech G233 Prodigy Stereo HeadsetLogitech XL G840 Cloth Mouse PadCreative Sound BlasterX AE-5 32-Bit DAC/384Khz PCIe Sound Card(삼성) SAMSUNG 960 PRO 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD(삼성) SAMSUNG 960 PRO 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD(삼성) SAMSUNG 850 EVO 2TB AHCI SATA SSD(삼성) SAMSUNG 960 Pro 2TB NVMe M.2 SSDCooler Master HAF-X Full Tower CaseSeasonic Prime 650W 80 Plus Titanium PSUACER Predator XB272 27"" 1920 x 1080 240Hz  8-Bit TN G-Sync PanelWindows 10 64-Bit HomeNVIDIA GeForce Driver: 388.13MSI Afterburner Overlay 4.3.0RTSS (RivaTuner) 7.0.0 Beta 19https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGDs-QsRDMM&t=1shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LttwQWSi-cc&t=1124s"

												Call of Duty: WWII, a game we've all been waiting to go back to. I loved going back to play some of the older CoDs that didn't have any futuristic weapons or armor. Sadly, there aren't enough people who go back to those older CoDs. So, thanks for Sledgehammer, we can finally have lobbies full of players while playing ""boots on the ground."" People loved the old way of CoD and now we have it again. This is the set and stone for the future of CoD and it will continue to get better.Call of Duty: WWII brings back a ""boots on the ground"" experience with very rich and emotional campaign. The multiplayer has tons of items to play with, as well as zombies. Zombies brings a horrific and terrific ride with jumpscares, as well as buildups."

												Bought the game purley from nostalgia, only for multiplayer. Not played in years, hated it at first. Key is to learn the maps and how the spawn routine works. I can also say late game weapons are way more powerful than early weapons compared to the older games where most weapons felt 'useable' and balanced. War (new game mode) is also very fun, it has a battlefeild feel to it defending and attacking objectives such as tanks moving tanks, bridges ect. There is one beach assult map where the starting timer is you on a boat approaching a beach where the other team is in bunkers and it is a beach assult, feels epic. First zombies map is okay, there is a series of objectives like turning power on ect, but because of the design of the map there is no semi-safe places so suriving long term is impossible as you are too exposed."

												POS.  I'd say this game is 50/50 between actual game play & watching a lame storyline movie.  The controls, specificly during the tank & flying segments, are terrible.  The hit factor from the weapons is a joke.  Unless you get a head shot, you'll need to empty the mag in order to put one guy down.  I know for a fact that a center-mass hit from a 30-06 Garand will put anyone down for good, let alone a double-tap.  Yet in this game, two shots to the chest will drop them only to have them shake their head & come up shooting.  COD IW was ok, this game just sucks."

												Call of Duty®: WWII is the latest entry in the franchise and comes off as underwhelming and overpriced. Of course, being on the PC platform, I knew that multiplayer would be dead from the start, as there is absolutely no policing against cheaters and so I got this game for the campaign. Zombies is nice, but since the singleplayer and multiplayer are installed separately, I decided to forego the zombies altogether.Essentially then, this is a single-player review. The campaign is nothing that hasn't been seen before. It starts off with the invasion of D-Day, in an underwhelming set piece that feels a little too easy. The game proceeds to follow a platoon of forgettable characters with shallow, stereotypical personalities as they advance towards Germany. The game ends with finding the ""horror"" of the Nazi concentration and work camps, but is presented in such a way that feels like a cheap, false sentiment from a bad war film.And that really sums up the campaign. A ""bad war film"". Some of the set-pieces were nice to look at, but it's all been seen before. Call of Duty: World At War back in the day showed the Japanese side of things, as well as the eastern front from the Russian perspective. Those too have been tackled, but at the time felt fresh. This game instead feels like a rip-off of most mediocre WWII films with bland gameplay. You're either in a cut-scene or shooting aimlessly at enemies.Did I enjoy the game? It was ""fine"", but not worth the price. And since I knew multiplayer was a futile attempt anyway, I essentially paid $50 to review the underwhelming campaign. If you don't mind blowing money on something like this, then go for it. Otherwise, you knew what to expect."

Have had no end of issues trying to connect with multiple error codes. Its not like activison does not know how many people will be buying the game so why cant they release it in a working state? Also love how♥♥♥♥♥♥the peer to peer is on the game, kill cams are always a treat when on the enemy feed you are in the open but on your screen you are completely behind a wall. All and all just not really an acceptable game for the year 2017. It is fun when its working and i can forgive most of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in the game but the fact that multiplayer has been ♥♥♥♥ed since release with errors connecting i would stay away and wait for a sale, or better yet get it on a key site and hope activison does not see a dime of the money.UPDATE: it seems that they have finally fixed the cluster flop of server issues. I enjoy the game very much. I have only really played for any extent of time the war mode as i find the maps on the other modes in MP pretty aweful. With only three maps i am recomending the game so again i find it to be a great throw back to the old days of COD glory"

Really enjoyable, takes time to adapt and get used to the kind of gameplay that it offers(Not to mention all the COD veterans that play it 24/7). But yeah, you should give it a try that's for sure.

I wish i could play more but i cant even get into a game.[Now] Now the game has servers that acutally work, this game is loads more fun to play,and tbh its one of the best COD's i have played. The campaign has a really good story with a great ending and multi-player is really fun (apart from the map Gustav Cannon) However i cant say much about zombies as i dont really play it, but from what i have played its pretty good!Would recommend buying!"

												Singleplayer review:       First of all, I didn't get anything of the stupid story this game has. I only cared about shooting stuff,  really. The AI is garbage. There was this mission where I had to rescue a kid from a nazi hotel,  or something and you can literally walk right past the nazis and they won't give a crap.       What is interesting though is that your health doesn't regen over time, you have to find medkits to heal, which should make the game a bit more challenging, but it doesn't. You find the medkits from 10 to 10 metres and your squad gives you one every 2 minutes or so, so again they deleted any kind of challenge.        DO NOT buy this for the singleplayer. You should consider the SP as an add-on for the Multiplayer, in case shooting actual people gets boring for you.Multiplayer review:       Yeah, in comparison with BO3 or Infinite Warfare, WWII's MP is far, far better mainly because no one had jetpacks in World War II. There is somewhat of a large gun variety for each of the 5 Divisions. The downside of MP are the supply drops and the fact that people can spectate you opening them, making them want to buy some for themselves, which I think is pretty f*cked up.       But overall the Multiplayer is pretty enjoyable. Haven't played so much of it, I'm only level 16 on the Infantry Division so I can't tell you how good is it after a long period of time, but you should have fun for at least 20 hours with it. It's your call to decide whether or not that's worth 60 bucks."

												Got this green screen colored flickering stuff on my screen, not sure if my monitor been smoking weed, but i guess it's the driverfailiure for the graphic card. And it's updated to the newest.Im keeping the review a negativ til a fix, right now i cannot play the game.Edit: 03.11.17 - 21:51: It Finally worked, had to change the screen monitor options, game feels a little stiff on the single player, some random fps drops, but not very often, the mouse kinda feels like it's ported grom the consols into the pc, very clunky.Tryid hopping into the MP but got en error of servers beeing down atm.. Still keeping it a bad review til this game actually get update of patches to some better hotfixes, i hope to try MP atleast tomrrow.Ok! Finally i can give a better review! The campaign is more or less meh, not much driving you into the single player, it's ok and thats all i have to say on that.Multiplayer on other hand is way cooler, some bugs and stuff randomly occuring but nothing major, been playing for some hours now.. Some weapons feel underpowered and some very overpowered and that's a shame, no jetpacks and superfast movements this time and good is that... Setting it to a positive.."

												Until I can figure out the 2 player co-op/ split screen for zombies its not worth it. Its not rocket science for either the xbox or ps4 by the videos ive seen. If your wanting to play it in split screen mode with a family memebr or friend then buy the console version and this comes from someone who hates consoles alot. Hell Tekken 7 which came out for pc for the 1st time has a co-op/ VS mode against 2 people and its easy to set up.***edit*** finally after almost 3 months they made an update for it to be splitscreen zombies which is really good i think (I miss the ray gun tho) and recommended it for the zombies and singleplayer. multiplayer tho eh not so much"

												So I waited until the price dropped and patches were released: The game has great graphics and mechanics.That's pretty much everything. With a download size of over 80GB and install size of over 110GB, it's not worth the time and efford, because the game crashed every 5 minutes or so, online / co-op zombies is laggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥and sometimes heavily game breaking texture glitches occur in the campaign.Hurts for me to say this, but I'd be happy with only €10 refund.Sorry COD, you have officially lost me and my support."

												I am havinng a lot of fun with this and it was a risk to get on pc. Unfortunately, the game is pretty dead and hacked to all hell. Sledgehammer seems to ignore their PC playerbase and let the hackers run free, not banning or taking care of the problem. For now, I would not recommend getting this games on the PC but that could change in the future. The only modes you can play regularly is Team Deathmatch, War, and Domination. If you are lucky, you can find a game of Free for All or Hardpoint but it is unlikely. So my conclusion is the game is good, although the hit registration seems pretty bad, and if only more players were on PC and hack protection existed, I would recommend this. For now, stick to the console version."

												I would say that this game is bad optimized, but it wasn't NEVER OPTIMIZED! Even respecting game's hardware requirments the game retain an unacepptable performance on my almost 2000$ computer, with the result of random frame drops during all matches (And all this when i choosed into settings the option ""optimize graphic settings""). Turning off the v-sync, and even giving a limit to frames to 60fps the game still have those issues, that mixed with my not so good connection transform the gaming experience into an hellish torture!If you dosen't have atleast a 100 mega connection you will be always bested by everyone who have a superior connection than you, with the result of prefires and not counted bullets on the targhet that will sometimes fudge up you badly into a gunfight.Weapons are pretty bad balanced like every other call of duty. Snipers that dosen't require basic abilities, the default shotgun with an huge range that will ohko you everytime (and it can support incendiary bullets......really?!) and melee weapons that give you an insane sprint out time that will let you one hit kill everything on your way.Some maps are unplayable. e.s: Gustav Cannon (a.k.a the camper realm), uss texas (random sniping and camping into tiny spaces).MY VOTE IS 2 OUT OF 10! Definitely unplayable due the NOT OPTIMIZATION. Other problems are secondary if you can't even play the game without problems. I advise you to don't buy this garbage, since developers dosen't care about optimize their products rather than add new (useless) features."

												The question: is call of duty ww2 a good game?The awnser is ""meh"".The zombies is the same old zombies that you know and love with some new ideas thrown in to the mix. With the adjustment to a more horror style, it brings zombies to a fairly good crossroad. The lack of the ability to rebuild windows removes the easy points in the beginning, but this is the only thing that this actually removes. More zombie types only makes you have to change your in the moment decisions by running from the explosive holding zombie instead of running throught the horde before you. The easter egg is given to you by the developers. There is a notebook that will tell you how to solve the easter egg, but it can be vague at times. The multiplayer is full of the same hackers, trolls, and twelve year olds just like the pervious call of duty titles. But with the addition of divisions and the ""war"" mode, this call of duty is only some what more complex. The divisions allow you to have extra perks that only that division can control. Some divisions give certain weapon types some added benefits like assault rifles get bayonets and SMGs' get suppressors. These divisions can also be leveled up to allow the unlocking of more abilities. War modes gives you several objectives to complete in order to succeed. Depending on which side your on, you will have to attack several objectives or defend these objectives from the enemy team. But be warned that the same people who played the previous call of dutys are still here.The campain seems as if it got some attention, but still falls to the old flaws that all modern call of duty games have. The characters seem to have some personality and motives, but these characters emote. This is a slight revelation compared to the black faced character from infinity ward and the nap inducing story archs from treyarch. But this campaign still involves the terrible levels of driving a vechicle. The tank in one section is actually undrivable. It controlls so bad that you will question if the developers wanted you to give up and play multiplayer or zombies. Let me also add that this game has stealth sections. Why does every game developer that makes any game but a stealth focused game want to add stealth to a non stealth game? It only makes that level unbearable to play because they don't acuatlly understand how sealth actually works. But in short, I give this game an eight out of ten. Points for a good zombies game and a multiplayer that isnt completely cancer. But points are removed for the shotty campaing and many bugs that still exist."

												SPOILERS - We won.Campaign - 7/10Multiplayer - Toxic/10 as expectedFirst of all, the game looks reasonable but you can clearly see that it's just the same old stuff thrown into a box with some glue. It all sticks together but it looks messy at times. (I know, great example but it's all you need.)The campaign was fairly mediocre. It just plays out as a regular war film would. Not much else to say about that.The multiplayer is actually not as bad as I thought it would be, it's genuinely interesting. I only play War so I can't say anything about S&D and such but i'd expect they'd be the same as always.As you may have noticed, I rate multiplayer at Toxic/10 because of this:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915083http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915106http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915301http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915330http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915437I think you get the idea by now.Obviously, there's the option to turn chat off but when playing the War game mode, there's often a point where you'll find yourself on a team that knows nothing about objectives. That's normal in CoD, hardly anyone understands what objectives are.Basically, if you want to buy this game, wait til it's on sale and prepare yourself for putting in more effort than usual when playing War.You'll be hated, you'll be slaughtered, you'll feel alone but this is war after all.."

												The hype for this new BOTG CoD game was immense, and I think that the game mostly lived up to the titles it was made to be generalized as. That is on console. On PC this game is an absolute mess. An atrocity in my eyes, the game is littered with annoying bugs, such as the spawning in glitch (Not just on PC), and the bug where you couldn't start the game without the task manager open (No idea why task manager solved it but it did). Here comes the worst of them all, the pathetic optimization this game brings, I have a fairly decent rig, consisting of mainly a GTX 750 ti, and an I5-6400. This rig is within minimum reqs. for this game. Despite this, the game feels unfinished, it stutters and freezes (At the worst possible times mind you), and it overall just doesn't deliver what it does on console. The biggest problem I see in this game are the lazy Devs, Sledgehammer dawned upon us the Exo ♥♥♥♥♥how, and now they are shoving the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥♥they could possibly find down the throats of mid tier PC gamers. I think that if Rust can bring their game from terrible optimization to the great state its in now, this game should be well capable of doing so. (Before you go telling me that this and Rust are two complete different games, I know that, but the big picture is that the game is unfinished, and the optimization is half of what an early access game of twice its scale is)"

												Call of Duty®: WWII is the latest entry in the franchise and comes off as underwhelming and overpriced. Of course, being on the PC platform, I knew that multiplayer would be dead from the start, as there is absolutely no policing against cheaters and so I got this game for the campaign. Zombies is nice, but since the singleplayer and multiplayer are installed separately, I decided to forego the zombies altogether.Essentially then, this is a single-player review. The campaign is nothing that hasn't been seen before. It starts off with the invasion of D-Day, in an underwhelming set piece that feels a little too easy. The game proceeds to follow a platoon of forgettable characters with shallow, stereotypical personalities as they advance towards Germany. The game ends with finding the ""horror"" of the Nazi concentration and work camps, but is presented in such a way that feels like a cheap, false sentiment from a bad war film.And that really sums up the campaign. A ""bad war film"". Some of the set-pieces were nice to look at, but it's all been seen before. Call of Duty: World At War back in the day showed the Japanese side of things, as well as the eastern front from the Russian perspective. Those too have been tackled, but at the time felt fresh. This game instead feels like a rip-off of most mediocre WWII films with bland gameplay. You're either in a cut-scene or shooting aimlessly at enemies.Did I enjoy the game? It was ""fine"", but not worth the price. And since I knew multiplayer was a futile attempt anyway, I essentially paid $50 to review the underwhelming campaign. If you don't mind blowing money on something like this, then go for it. Otherwise, you knew what to expect."

												This game seriously needs work before I can rate it a thumbs up. It's fun, it has the old call of duty feel to it, and it 100% delivered what the community has been wanting.Gameplay wise, this game is easily a 7 or 8 in my opinion. But as for optimization and the way the game runs on practically any machine unless you know how to solve the bugs is very annoying and shouldn't be required to play the game, or any game.Overall, I cannot recommend the game at it's current stand point. If these issues are fixed in the future which honestly should have been fixed since day one, I will reconsider my review towards your game Sledgehammer."

												I played all of the Call of Duty Games since the start. I really enjoyed most of them (speaking of the campaign) so i was hyped to finally go back to ww2 and what they said and promised about a accurate/authentic singleplayer experience...so what could go wrong ? First off, i did enjoy this campaign alot cause it’s basically more of the same BUT Dear Activision/Sledgehammer Games would you kindly go fix those terrible uniforms, censored flags and symbols of all kinds. There is a lot historically wrong but hey, i did not expect all to be perfect. Go and take a look at some real german ww2 uniforms on google if you don’t have a book handy. Just by adding some random swastika flags you don’t make the game better you make it worse. Especially when leaving most of the game censored to begin with. Why ?  Just why couldn’t you even get those uniforms right.....disappointed.Though i give the game a thumbs up cause i had fun in general."

												Singleplayer review:       First of all, I didn't get anything of the stupid story this game has. I only cared about shooting stuff,  really. The AI is garbage. There was this mission where I had to rescue a kid from a nazi hotel,  or something and you can literally walk right past the nazis and they won't give a crap.       What is interesting though is that your health doesn't regen over time, you have to find medkits to heal, which should make the game a bit more challenging, but it doesn't. You find the medkits from 10 to 10 metres and your squad gives you one every 2 minutes or so, so again they deleted any kind of challenge.        DO NOT buy this for the singleplayer. You should consider the SP as an add-on for the Multiplayer, in case shooting actual people gets boring for you.Multiplayer review:       Yeah, in comparison with BO3 or Infinite Warfare, WWII's MP is far, far better mainly because no one had jetpacks in World War II. There is somewhat of a large gun variety for each of the 5 Divisions. The downside of MP are the supply drops and the fact that people can spectate you opening them, making them want to buy some for themselves, which I think is pretty f*cked up.       But overall the Multiplayer is pretty enjoyable. Haven't played so much of it, I'm only level 16 on the Infantry Division so I can't tell you how good is it after a long period of time, but you should have fun for at least 20 hours with it. It's your call to decide whether or not that's worth 60 bucks."

												Got this green screen colored flickering stuff on my screen, not sure if my monitor been smoking weed, but i guess it's the driverfailiure for the graphic card. And it's updated to the newest.Im keeping the review a negativ til a fix, right now i cannot play the game.Edit: 03.11.17 - 21:51: It Finally worked, had to change the screen monitor options, game feels a little stiff on the single player, some random fps drops, but not very often, the mouse kinda feels like it's ported grom the consols into the pc, very clunky.Tryid hopping into the MP but got en error of servers beeing down atm.. Still keeping it a bad review til this game actually get update of patches to some better hotfixes, i hope to try MP atleast tomrrow.Ok! Finally i can give a better review! The campaign is more or less meh, not much driving you into the single player, it's ok and thats all i have to say on that.Multiplayer on other hand is way cooler, some bugs and stuff randomly occuring but nothing major, been playing for some hours now.. Some weapons feel underpowered and some very overpowered and that's a shame, no jetpacks and superfast movements this time and good is that... Setting it to a positive.."

												Here's the thing, game is Arcade as fock just like most of games in CoD series. When you think of CoD, you must forget games before CoDMW2, since CoDMW started this gameplay direction, CoDMW2 made it a standard for all future ones. So NO realism, just gun 'n' run style, no brain needed, that's CoD, if you don't like this gameplay style, avoid CoD.Overall: Graphics/visuals? In OK category. Sounds? Crap. WW2 settings? Excellent. Historically accurate? Story kinda, MP not at all.Story? Fairly good.MP? Crap.MP War Mod? It's the ONLY GOOD thing in MP.MP Net Code? Somewhat good.Zombies mod? Fairly good.Game stability? Fine on my end. It never crashed.Console to PC port? Definitely, PC is a sideshow.Same or Better as CoD 1, 2, WAW? NopeBetter than last several releases of CoD? YupSo it's OK-ish."

												*UPDATE* This game is unplayable at the moment - I lose connection to the servers almost every single round.So, this is the first CoD game I've bought myself since Black Ops II. I've played more recent ones with friends but they deviated so much from what CoD was that they were completely unenjoyable (though BO3 zombies was ace). I was hoping that this would be a return to the good CoD of old, and despite the reviews I went ahead and purchased it. The first thing I would emphasize is that this is NOT a return to World at War - it's still the modern CoD game mechanics just with the original guns we all came to love in WaW. If you want slightly more realism then Battlfield 1 is absolutely the way to go (which I recommend much more than this game for sure!). CoD WW2 feels no different to any of the newer CoD titles, though admittedly without the terrible 'quirks' such as jetpacks and the like.So, I have recommended it - why? Becuase it's still just some harmless, mindless fun. Zombies is very enjoyable and is probably the redeeming feature of this release, though further maps would be very welcome as the included map can get boring after some time. Is CoD WW2 worth the £45? Probably not, but if you're used to the CoD franchise and the gameplay then it's certainly not the WORST CoD (far from), but don't expect to be transported back to WaW like I was hoping. I haven't played the campaign yet so can't speak there, but from the sounds of things it is very short (and let's not even begin to start on the historical innacuracies!)."

												Campaign is good, has great visuals and playability even though it feels like you have seen it before. For those of you looking into  multiplayer you might want to look else where. The game tends to have to many prefire, quickscoping, and walling turds, that take advantage of the games coding in order to get the upper hand for a win. I will also like to state that some players have the ability to see through walls and can kill you through them even metal surfaces without fmj or highcaliber weapons and will also know your every location even even if you are not moving and there are no killstreaks up. Watching the killcams as they kill you make you question the very code of the game or sanity/skill and often want pull your hair out, so if you value your gaming sanity and or the expensisve computer your on, play something else."

												Is the game groundbreaking? No. It's pretty much standard fare these days for a FPS and does look nice if you have a rig with enough beef in the GPU. The stuttering and framerate issues can, in most part, be solved by installing new GPU drivers.  Happy to see the franchise return to its roots in WWII but so far is a ""ok"" experience- not a great one and not very memorable.  Campaign storyline is ""meh"" with plenty of the stereotypes you find in most WWII B-movies. Historical inaccuracies abound and makes you wonder if anyone on the team bothered to actually do research. If you enjoy blasting Nazis in a more historical setting that Wolfenstein, this is worth your time. A solid, but overall, not groundbreaking FPS. Wish I could give it a neutral rating because it is really overall a disappointing product. Wait for it to drop in price before buying."

												EDIT: Hours shown are single player only. Seperate hubs because... Reasons. Honestly; most of these negative reviews are by people complaining about historical inaccuracies or single words with no valid points. Is that what's important? To an extent. From what I've played the campaign is okay, nothing amazing. The beach scene was too short. If you want single-player only; I honestly wouldn't bother. Note about lootboxes; they are so easy to earn and I am yet to find this mythical 'buy' button. Mabye in time but for now it is tamed. Akin to overwatch. Now for the multiplayer. Is it fun? Yes. The grounded gameplay is great, the maps are well designed. From the close quarters trench warfare to the open Gustav cannon map, which is a personal favourite of mine because I love the STG. Ridiculous scorestreaks? Well yes. HQ: This feature is really good IMO. The 1v1 and minigames features are fun little extras. How does it run? Great, drops here and there but overall pretty nicely optimised. I notice msot negative reviews on performance are from GTX 970's, can we stop pretending this is still a relevent card for modern AAA releases? Zombies; simply, fun. My score: 7.5/10.

LGBT flags, women and black people make a game more diverse, but in this case, the game is supposed to be a WW2 experience, and stuff like this ruins it.When it comes to performance and bugs I haven't expericenced any problems. The game runs at 60 fps with ultra settings 1080p on my laptop. Make sure to check the system requirements and drivers on your system. My specs are:Intel Core i7-7700HQnVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB16 GB DDR4 RAM1080p G-Sync screenAll in all the game is ""meh"". I don't dislike it, but it could have been much better."

												I haven't played a CoD game in a long time, but I participated in the multiplayer beta for this game and enjoyed myself. With quickish game modes and a not terribly lopsided leveling system, it's enjoyable enough to play the multiplayer on my own. I disliked the campaign, the first couple of missions were alright, but I stopped playing after the train mission, it just seemed way too over the top.Zombies seems like it is okay, I haven't put a lot of time into it yet, but has the potential to be a great time with friends."

												Would not recommend game.FPS system is awfully designed and has many flaws, online matchmaking takes ages, many errors with connecting to friends games, the loading system is awful as you have two separate files, one launches into the menu for campaign, the other is for multiplayer, and to get to zombies you have to launch either of these and then click on zombies and then it closes the game you have just loaded to open a different launcher which is zombies, but it won’t load it correctly giving an error (speaking to my friends they all have the same issue) and so you close that and then eventually without pressing anything else it will load (no way to actually check if it is still trying to launch) so that is a great way to launch a game, why can it not all just be in one launcher, console peasants manage it so why can PC not?So this is the short list of problems with the game the list can go on, WOULD NOT RECCOMEND AT ALL!"

												I do recommend this game, the controls are classic, the guns are satisfying, and the campaign is not the worst ever. However if you are looking for a couch co-op experience, then look elsewhere becase COD WWII does not allow splitscreen on PC. What a joke."

												SP Review only, rest follows:Campaign was done in 7,6h on Veteran / Söldner.I played it in one session which speaks for the fun i had. But in the end its not on the same WOW level like the Cod 4 campaign, which was something you never saw before back in 2007.Many missions are pretty average, but there was not a single minute i was bored. The Paris and the Ardennen missions were the best. Big + is the focus on 1 guy, his story and his platoon, first time in cod i really did care what happen to my fellow fighters. Its not an oscar winning story, but still a good and entertaining one. Zussman and Red deliver a nice Bromance story. :)KI is ofc on the same dumb level as in all other CODS.Performance is great, never had bugs and run the game on everything smooth on everything max with 80 fps average Full HD, with no drops or anything at all. 1080 GTX user here. Graphics are not impressive compared to games like BF1. But not bad at all, there is always a lot going on and you visit many different locations. But dont expect to many surprising locations, they are well made with a lot of atmosphere but many times i thought i have seen this place before in many other ww2 games. France, Remagen bridge, even Hürtgen forest in Cod 2 for example etc.I only wish the campaign was bigger and focus on the eastern front and the war against japan as well. I mean the game is called WW2, so i thought we see much more locations than in Cod World at War.Is it worth 60€ only for the SP? No. But who buys Cod only for the SP, it was always a good intro for the MP battles.And dont forget the Zombie Modus. I didnt play theese so far.Its not a mindblowing SP, they could have put more locations in the game (like i said russians, japan etc) and the missions are mostly average - if you played a lot of WW2 shooters, dont expect big surprises. But the story around Red and his platoon and the action keeps you playing until the end. I had much fun playing it. I rate it 83/100 for the SP.Lets go online.Edit: Online...: Huge and massive disappointment. The game looks terrible, small maps and almost no love in detail, the maps feel so fake, like you would play on a Paintball arena not in WW2. To be honest it feels even like a step backwards compared to the last Cods...The sounds are strange, fake. Animations look pretty bad for such a huge trippe A title. Gunplay is okay, but doesn't reach the level of MW 1-2 or W@W. + is the new war mode but in gods name it has only 3 maps?!? The other modes are Cod standard. Sledgehammer put but absoluty no love for detail in this Multiplayer. Let me give you examples.When you equip a grip on your gun like the StG 44 it wont be shown in battle or in the menue...wtf is this. Its too much work to model it, this cant be real.Second example. Like in MW Remastered you can unlock new optic for your guns, which change the way it looks pretty hard. The Lee Enfield special variant looks so pathetic, they cut of the barrel alomost complete, look at this:https://www.pic-upload.de/view-34235093/fail.jpg.htmlIn MWR things like that worked, cause of the setting, a golden gun np. But you cant♥♥♥♥♥♥legendary WW2 weapons like this. Its only a small piece why this game is a big let down in MP.I cant believe i spend 60€ on this crap, Cod is finally dead. Lets hope Dice release BF 1944 next year so we can finally enjoy WW2 again. I will test the MP a bit more, but what i have seen so far in a few hours was a not worth the money.Why did Acctivsion gave such an important Cod to Sledgehammer Devs, they made the pathetic MW3 and AW. Huge fails in the Cod series. -_-Infintiy Ward or Tryarch would have made a far better Cod in WW2, im sure. IW made Cod 1, Cod 2 and MW which are known as the best Cod games.Treyarch made atleast one good Cod: World at War. They had experience with the WW2 setting..."

												I truly enjoyed Call of Duty: WWII in Single Player Campaign. The game feels fast, fluid, responsive, and classic return of boots on the ground, though I did played Call of Duty way back in 2003. For performance-wise, PC version supports 250 frames per second in MP while goes beyond 250fps in SP Campaign. I was able to run between 200-250fps with GTX 1080 Ti in 1920 x 1080 Resolution. I don't experience crash at all. The characters and plot was interesting to learn; it captures heroism, belief, emotionalism, and also delivers powerful story which was inspired by true story back in World War II era. And of course, it's also inspired by popular TV series and Movies such as Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Redline, Hacksaw Ridge, etc.  I have still got more ways to go to complete the campaign, and then hop into MP and then some Zombie mode. Overall, I am glad that Sledgehammer Games, Raven Software, and Activision have listened to the PC community based on feedback from Steam Community, Twitter, and/or Reddit during the PC Open Beta on September 29th - October 1st, 2017, and will continue to make PC port great again! If you are huge fan of WWII First Person Shooter Game, I highly recommend ordering Call of Duty: WWII and enjoy the classic return of boots on the ground! Pros:-Game supports G-Sync/FreeSync-Unlocked framerate in SP while limited to 250fps in MP-Mouse Sensitivity Number Value (including) Slider-Supports 4:3, 16:9, 16:9, and 21:9-VRAM Usage Overcommitment-Graphics looks stunningly fantastic which is powered by heavily modified idTech (Quake) Engine-Supports High Resolution Mouse-Includes Raw-Mouse Input-High Tick-Rate Server (60Hz+) Support-In MP, game supports Dedicated Server-Gun sound mix was crisp, clear, and amazing-Dialogue was excellent-Character details look good-No Health Regeneration Mechanic in SP, though ask NPC to get First Aid Kit while MP, on the other hand, has Health Regeneration Mechanic-Mantle system was fast and responsive-Animation system was outstanding, and felt like you sprint what an actual rifleman carries firearm in the military -Delivers outstanding classic first person shooter WWII Military Theme-Campaign length time was about 6-7 hours longCons:-Some SLI users are having poor performance due to low GPU utilization-Some users report that screen flashes/flickers green when launching the game-Launching the game shows up black screen, and I had to press Alt+Tab to resume the game and now displays the image properly-In MP, there's no Dedicated Server Browser-Some people may say the game is not historically accurate which is not true. For instance, German carrying PPSH-41 on D-Day Mission. The German Nazis captured PPSH-41 and then converted & modified into Standard German Submachine Gun.

												I recommend this game but yet I don't. First if you are looking to play multiplayer, yes it is the old COD experience in a way. Yes the gun system would be the same. Yeah there is a ""balance"" in the guns and yes some are overpowered to most. The big no here is just the hackers. I've been in many matches almost fairly matched with people who weren't hacking. But when you do encounter those hackers, there is nothing you can do about it besides complain in game. Why would you make a triple A title with no report system?! And the interp in this game is literal garbage. It is actually worse than Rainbow Six Siege and that is even bad! There's just lack in the multiplayer scene and it's sad. Yeah I have my good games and yeah I know I will have my bad but seriously? Can't do anything against hackers? *claps*. The only reason why I would recommend this game is cause of ZOMBIES! It is actually fun and a challenge. The ""easter egg"" is pretty fun to do and gets pretty challenging if you do it in the later rounds. Non stop zombie action in waves, no more windows to camp and barricade. I personally enjoy it and I would grind it more than multiplayer until they fix what they need to do. Please I hope you take this review into consideration. Don't get me wrong, everything in WW2 is fun just again multiplayer is not at it's prime."

												I actually enjoyed the campaign. It's still pretty short, but it was the first Call of Duty campaign that's really been able to get my attention. Historical inaccuracies and all. Multiplayer, the game's main selling point, is a little bit different. In core the weapon balancing and hit detection are trash, and the game is overrun by snipers/quickscopers. You can also expect to run into at least one hacker every few games. So I tried hardcore. And people camp so hard that it seemed like I could play a through few games at a time without even swapping spawns. I would recommend this game for the campaign, but the campaign alone is worth no where near $60."

Its a series I just can't take seriously and in this case, that's a good thing. While I don't see myself playing it TOO much longer or buying any DLC, it was still good to go back to CoD for a minute.Not the GREATEST game EVER but I still had fun with the time I spent with it.7/10"

												Mindless (WW II) fun and sniping. Needed it to chill a bit. So, pick up the game if you're up for that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯L.E.: Realized this is for the single-player. Errm, the story was pretty cliche and you'll probably get the ""seen it all in dem movies"" feeling, but if you're up for about 6h of fun (around 9 if you want to unlock and fin' all the stuff) Wait for a sale... :D"

												Good game, overall graphics are nice and animations are statisfying. runs fairly well. i get 100-180 Fps at 1440p with my 7700k @ 4.8Ghz and Gtx 1070.Cons: I feel like i die very quickly but it takes a while for me to kill people even when i land all shots, there is way to much aimpunch, A STUPID AMOUNT it pisses me off, if u get shot ur basically aimming at the sky. Lastly i die around corners a lot even tho i have 3 bars (doesnt show ping).Ok so now the big problem is everyone is lagging, shows 3 bars but everyone is complaing about rubber banding. My last game it was 2v5 is ♥♥♥♥ing team deathmatch, nobody left it started 2v5 and we got rekt all game, does this game not have auto fill or someshit? Cod is killing its self no wonder it has♥♥♥♥♥♥reviews devs dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥"

												Singleplayer review:       First of all, I didn't get anything of the stupid story this game has. I only cared about shooting stuff,  really. The AI is garbage. There was this mission where I had to rescue a kid from a nazi hotel,  or something and you can literally walk right past the nazis and they won't give a crap.       What is interesting though is that your health doesn't regen over time, you have to find medkits to heal, which should make the game a bit more challenging, but it doesn't. You find the medkits from 10 to 10 metres and your squad gives you one every 2 minutes or so, so again they deleted any kind of challenge.        DO NOT buy this for the singleplayer. You should consider the SP as an add-on for the Multiplayer, in case shooting actual people gets boring for you.Multiplayer review:       Yeah, in comparison with BO3 or Infinite Warfare, WWII's MP is far, far better mainly because no one had jetpacks in World War II. There is somewhat of a large gun variety for each of the 5 Divisions. The downside of MP are the supply drops and the fact that people can spectate you opening them, making them want to buy some for themselves, which I think is pretty f*cked up.       But overall the Multiplayer is pretty enjoyable. Haven't played so much of it, I'm only level 16 on the Infantry Division so I can't tell you how good is it after a long period of time, but you should have fun for at least 20 hours with it. It's your call to decide whether or not that's worth 60 bucks."

												Got this green screen colored flickering stuff on my screen, not sure if my monitor been smoking weed, but i guess it's the driverfailiure for the graphic card. And it's updated to the newest.Im keeping the review a negativ til a fix, right now i cannot play the game.Edit: 03.11.17 - 21:51: It Finally worked, had to change the screen monitor options, game feels a little stiff on the single player, some random fps drops, but not very often, the mouse kinda feels like it's ported grom the consols into the pc, very clunky.Tryid hopping into the MP but got en error of servers beeing down atm.. Still keeping it a bad review til this game actually get update of patches to some better hotfixes, i hope to try MP atleast tomrrow.Ok! Finally i can give a better review! The campaign is more or less meh, not much driving you into the single player, it's ok and thats all i have to say on that.Multiplayer on other hand is way cooler, some bugs and stuff randomly occuring but nothing major, been playing for some hours now.. Some weapons feel underpowered and some very overpowered and that's a shame, no jetpacks and superfast movements this time and good is that... Setting it to a positive.."

												Recently I reviewed this game as negative, however, they have updated it and now I will say this game is awesome. I have 27 plus hours played on multiplayer and started off hating it. The update they just implicated is amazing. They even fixed quick scoping a bit. It’s still bad, just not nearly as easy to do, which is great. Shotguns have been fixed along with nerfing the bar, overall this is a great update and game now. ZOMBIES is fun. There wasnt really anything wrong with it before the update, zombie lovers, get this game. Multiplayer players, get this game. I still haven’t played campaign so i can’t recommend that."

												Call Of Duty WWII is a decent Call of Duty game.

												---Review points after education rant---        **Links in comments**I don't know if any of the game owners and critics are historians- I sure know I'm not. Lord knows my interest in WW2 stems from playing CoD 2 at an age likely far younger than I should have been.However, a big number of the 'Not Recommended' I've found have minimal basis in claiming ""historic innaccuracies,"" but I think that's a struggling claim, as I've said before that it's unlikely that the player base holds any intensely studied knowledge surpassing the knowledge gained from other WW2 shooters. Before I delve into that, two notes: reviews are criticizing the game for being too similar to previous Call of Duty titles in setting and battles, yet the same individuals call out the game for being, again, ""historically inaccurate."" Secondly, this is history, folks, and even historians will attest to inaccurate data collection because of destruction, and that wonderful human thing called memory loss (often a symptom exhibited by traumatized individuals.)Now, to the point. Two innaccuracies I recall from other reviews are: 1- the presence of the PPSH-41 submachinegun on the western front, 2- The presence of women, and men and women of color in the multiplayer, regardless of the affiliating country, particularily Germany under The Third Reich. I'll give my response in a opposite order, due to order of simplicity.The presence of unlikely demographics serving in the Wehrmacht is a foolish claim. The Third Reich happily sacrificed individuals it considered inferior to its preferred race of soldiers, particularily so because of people such as the Free Arabian Legion, and that's not even counting conscripted forces. Plus, this is multiplayer, why would you care about historic inaccuracies in the part of the game where you can equip yourself with any gun as any country's soldier?Now the presence of eastern firearms on the western front seems a little bit easier to say ""YEAH THAT'S DUMB THAT'S A RUSSIAN GUN,"" but that's dumb and you should feel bad if that's what you think. 1: D-Day was the 6th of June, 1944, Germany had been fighting soviets for nearly three years by the time D-Day came around. So, yes, the start of the war was not when the US joined in, that was just the beginning of the end; please read your history. 2: In that three years, German Wehrmacht soldiers were swapped between fronts (for whatever reason they had, I don't know,) in addition to captured-then-conscripted Red Army soldiers, if I'm not mistaken there were even some volunteers. 3: The PPSH-41 was acclaimed by Wehrmacht soldiers, and was often looted and rechambered for 9mm in place of its 7.62mm x 25mm.Call of Duty: World War II's representation of history isn't inaccurate just because one refuses to believe anything without first being spoon-fed the history. I can understand trying to defend accurate representation of history, but when you choose to assume that you know more than the deceased, and the surviving veterans of a war you held no part in, nor researched to the level of detail you claim to argue for, then that would be a greater disrespect to history than the misrepresentation you debate.Now that I've dumped an essay on this review, I'll keep it short.-It's a Call of Duty game (refer to this statement in case of negative reviews, keeping in mind the community as well.)-The campaign/story focuses on being a story (who would have thought?)-Sledgehammer is working on multiplayer optimizations, the game is releasing like the D-Day invasion.-Some can't play the game, blame the game, rather than troubleshooting their system.-Optimization issues, but I'm not playing desktop, so...-Brilliant acoustic compositions, both SFX and soundtrack, VO acting as well.-Story, with characters who aren't turrets with voices.-Simulated traumatic moments are emotionaly compelling, not just action-movie sequences-Close-quarters tank combat is unexpectedly terrifying-It's difficult to fly a plane, and I'm not just talking about the game.-Pays homage to Quentin TarantinoIf you find this game isn't what you wanted, you ought to ask yourself what you wanted in the first place. I'd recommend it if you like World War 2 narrative shooters and don't mind the lead(gold?) price tag."

												First off let me get multiplayer out of the way: It is CoD MP.... it is exactually what you expect. I've not played CoD multiplayer since MW3 minus some drunk gaming nights with friends in Ghosts most recently but probably less than 3 hours on that.Zombies are eh, zombies. Single Player...Holy Heck...........The story was well writen, quicktime doesn't feel like it is 80% of the game and I got a good 5 hours out of it with the first play through.  I felt there were moments that my choices actually effected the outcome of a mission (Not sure if that is true or not) and I'll probably play through it again in hopes of getting all the collectables. I really enjoyed it and it hurts me to say this but, I have to give single player an 8/10.  I'd like it to be longer but what they have felt great regardless"

												Sledgehammer must mean 'incompetent' in a foreign language. Hit recognition is terrible, servers are garbage, maps are few, small, and extremely similar in design, weapons are grossly unbalanced, but of course they made sure to get their COD Points in so they can continue to make money off of microtransactions. Oh, and of course let's not forget that they didn't even know that for the first few weeks they had the experience rate set incorrectly. Literally the only thing they got right was a boots on the ground style COD, and even then just barely. Hopefully Treyarch can actually make a decent FPS next year, because Sledgehammer sure couldn't figure it out."

												Had to switch this to a no go, there is currently NO VAC support, and if you check well known public cheat sites, you will see that the hacks released for BETA are STILL UNDETECTED.This is the most hacked COD since GHOSTS.It's a big step forward for COD getting away from the space suits!  If you compare it to BF1 head to head, I think BF1 is a better game, but comparing it to recent COD's this is great.I am unimpressed with the ""Slide the mouse and THEN hit the F button"" thing.  If you haven't played yet, it is pretty much adding an additional, cumbersome step to make interactive cut scenes seem different.  Before iut prompts you to hit the designated button, you have to slide your mouse down.Made it through the campaign, one thing I can say for certain is that the iD3 engine is showing it's age.  The game visuals simply are not on par with modern AAA titles."

Right now its saturday night and its a 2x bonus XP weekend, only 2k players online.  PUBG has 1.7mil players online right now......Guess what I'm getting instead.  So yeah, game is dead.

												The question: is call of duty ww2 a good game?The awnser is ""meh"".The zombies is the same old zombies that you know and love with some new ideas thrown in to the mix. With the adjustment to a more horror style, it brings zombies to a fairly good crossroad. The lack of the ability to rebuild windows removes the easy points in the beginning, but this is the only thing that this actually removes. More zombie types only makes you have to change your in the moment decisions by running from the explosive holding zombie instead of running throught the horde before you. The easter egg is given to you by the developers. There is a notebook that will tell you how to solve the easter egg, but it can be vague at times. The multiplayer is full of the same hackers, trolls, and twelve year olds just like the pervious call of duty titles. But with the addition of divisions and the ""war"" mode, this call of duty is only some what more complex. The divisions allow you to have extra perks that only that division can control. Some divisions give certain weapon types some added benefits like assault rifles get bayonets and SMGs' get suppressors. These divisions can also be leveled up to allow the unlocking of more abilities. War modes gives you several objectives to complete in order to succeed. Depending on which side your on, you will have to attack several objectives or defend these objectives from the enemy team. But be warned that the same people who played the previous call of dutys are still here.The campain seems as if it got some attention, but still falls to the old flaws that all modern call of duty games have. The characters seem to have some personality and motives, but these characters emote. This is a slight revelation compared to the black faced character from infinity ward and the nap inducing story archs from treyarch. But this campaign still involves the terrible levels of driving a vechicle. The tank in one section is actually undrivable. It controlls so bad that you will question if the developers wanted you to give up and play multiplayer or zombies. Let me also add that this game has stealth sections. Why does every game developer that makes any game but a stealth focused game want to add stealth to a non stealth game? It only makes that level unbearable to play because they don't acuatlly understand how sealth actually works. But in short, I give this game an eight out of ten. Points for a good zombies game and a multiplayer that isnt completely cancer. But points are removed for the shotty campaing and many bugs that still exist."

												SPOILERS - We won.Campaign - 7/10Multiplayer - Toxic/10 as expectedFirst of all, the game looks reasonable but you can clearly see that it's just the same old stuff thrown into a box with some glue. It all sticks together but it looks messy at times. (I know, great example but it's all you need.)The campaign was fairly mediocre. It just plays out as a regular war film would. Not much else to say about that.The multiplayer is actually not as bad as I thought it would be, it's genuinely interesting. I only play War so I can't say anything about S&D and such but i'd expect they'd be the same as always.As you may have noticed, I rate multiplayer at Toxic/10 because of this:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915083http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915106http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915301http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915330http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915437I think you get the idea by now.Obviously, there's the option to turn chat off but when playing the War game mode, there's often a point where you'll find yourself on a team that knows nothing about objectives. That's normal in CoD, hardly anyone understands what objectives are.Basically, if you want to buy this game, wait til it's on sale and prepare yourself for putting in more effort than usual when playing War.You'll be hated, you'll be slaughtered, you'll feel alone but this is war after all.."

												I'm a little 40 hours in at this point. Most of my time has been spent on multiplayer.The Good...The game runs great on my modest PC (i5, GTX 970, 8GB RAM). Looks amazing. Guns are varied and with the exception of the ridiculous quick scope mechanic seems to be well balanced. Matchmaking has been phenomenal as well, no complaints there. The maps are a nice mix of open areas, whith plenty of closed off sections that are great for close quarters.On the minus side, they simply overcomplicated most of the rewards, leveling and even the UI is a mess. Although having loot boxes drop onto Normandy beach is interesting, if not in poor taste. The loot box system has jumped the shark. I commend sledgehammer for negating the pay to win strategy that some other games have been employing, but most of the time all you get are pistol grips which are ridiculous, imho. Friends of mine who use controllers are complaining that the lack of aim assist makes this game unplayable with a controller. I'm not sure what the down side was or why aim assist was removed, but that's something that should be mentioned here.I haven't played a Call of Duty this much in this short a time since the original Black Ops. I actually prestiged in less than 2 weeks, and I'm a working adult with a family.  Do I recommend WW2? Yes."

Maybe its time upgrade your hardware and stop complaining about not being able to run the game. Ryzen 5 1600 4GHZ8GB 3000MHZ RAMGTX 1060 6gbGame runs great at highest settings with some minor stutter to to my lack of system memory.Campaign was fun and a great step up from the last few titles. Multiplay is much better then the last few titles as well. The boxes do not give you guns with stupid stats to get an edge over people but an cool look and a XP bonus per kill.Zommbies is well made and cant wait for the DLC's to come Overall a much better experience then the last few games. Only issue im having is connection issues."

												I have no idea what they were talking about with the new terrifying zombies. Its absoltuly nothing like the trailers. All the zombies sound like the tazmaniam devil off of looney toones and they also look cartoony. It's not even hard, I got to wave 20 with 3 other people effortlessly and then quit because I was bored of it. Zombies 2/10The campign is the worst part of this game, there is nothing historically accurate about it and they pretty much just copy pasted lines stright out of john wayne war movies. it really is hard to play when I can feel all the SJW bullcrap being crammed down my throat trying to include women and people of color in the game. newsflash WW2 was mostly a white peoples war. The campaign also does a horrible job telling a story with no connection to other characters. Definatly the worst campaign I have ever played in a video game EVER.  -5/10The multiplayer in my opinion is the only reason worth playing, when it works that is. but even then it's not that good.. The maps are absolutely horrible and it dosn't even feel like WW2 multiplayer. 2/10Overall this game sucks man... it dosn't even feel like a WW2 game. I wish I wouldn't have bought it.."

Did alright, but throughout the whole time, which completely killed the game for me, is poor optimization. I played the Beta as well, and my computer had no stutters, lag, anything. I finally had courage that CoD could potentially go back to the ""Boots on the Ground"" phase again, which thankfully it did, but had gotten destroyed due to servers, microstranactions, and poor optimization.

When you have people that are prestige 6+ in the first week the game came out it's kind of obvious, let alone dudes that are level 500+. Yes, 500+.  My last game had a guy on the opposite team with a prestige level of 554. However I had 2 guys on my team admittedly using aimbots causing the other team (aside from Mr. 554) to quit.Cheating has absolutely ruined this games multiplayer experience.I find it sad they are quick to add all kinds of cash grabs in the game, but don't even bother doing anything about the cheating.And while we are at it, adding women into combat infantry, let alone black women, is just absurd. Seeing black, hispanic, and other women running around as soldiers particularly the Wehrmacht is just insulting."

												Second favorite cod game after black ops 2. It is good to see a shooting game with existing guns and without supernatural jumping skills. I love the way they made the Headquarters, i have never seen anything like this in cod series, i love mmorpgs so i think it is making the game a lot better. I think the game is realistic (maybe the incendiary ammo for shotguns is bit weird but who cares). The multiplayer is really enjoyable and I am waiting for the next dlcs. I am a big fan of zombies, for the first time when i played the prologue it felt like Left for dead 2. There is a big difference between the Treyarch zombies and between the SHG zombies. In this type of zombies you don't have to play good, it is only about shooting and doing the main quest/easter egg. After my first game on The final reich i felt so bad, i was so sad about it. But now I really enjoy it, i play it all day with my firends.The campaign wasn't long as i expected, but it was really good (about 5 hours of gameplay). My favorite part is when you are a french spy and you go to a nazi basis and you are attemting to kill the director or who was he...I would like better grapics in the game searching lobby and more and more challages to do <3. If you are a big cod fan i recommend this game for you <3"

												It's the first CoD game after BO1 that I think is worth puting your time in.I didn't touch the campaign so far but will give it a try, zombies too.Some maps are really bad designed and the worst is USS Texas that forces you to play sniper becouse all others do :D.Like others reviewers I'm not affected so much with the historicly accurasy, I don't mind women and russian weapons on german side( i'ts a game ffs, go watch history channel for accurasy).I'd give a 7/10, good mp experience ruined mostly from the toxic and childish community."

												Yes it does seem like another COD game, and it essentially is. There is only so much content they can make new when everything has been done already. I like that they went back to their roots of a WW2 game and the graphics engine is certainly better than half the games on the market. Not up to standards of Battlefield in terms of graphics but it's good enough. Zombies is fun to say the least. I really like how they implemented tasks and that it's not a guessing game on how to do the easter eggs. However, online connectivity and matchmaking is atrocious. Lag is widespread, often users are unable to spawn for the first minute of the game. It definitely needs work.I give the game a solid 7/10. It's not jawdropping remarkable but it's fun and nostalgic of the old CODs. Also the network issues limit me from giving this anything higher than a 7."

												Had to switch this to a no go, there is currently NO VAC support, and if you check well known public cheat sites, you will see that the hacks released for BETA are STILL UNDETECTED.This is the most hacked COD since GHOSTS.It's a big step forward for COD getting away from the space suits!  If you compare it to BF1 head to head, I think BF1 is a better game, but comparing it to recent COD's this is great.I am unimpressed with the ""Slide the mouse and THEN hit the F button"" thing.  If you haven't played yet, it is pretty much adding an additional, cumbersome step to make interactive cut scenes seem different.  Before iut prompts you to hit the designated button, you have to slide your mouse down.Made it through the campaign, one thing I can say for certain is that the iD3 engine is showing it's age.  The game visuals simply are not on par with modern AAA titles."

												While this game doesn't quite capture the essence of the earlier CoD games, I absolutely belive WWII is a major step in the right direction, as far as gameplay goes. This game knows what it is, and does it pretty effectively. The campaign, I might add, is one of the most entertaining I've played since MW2. The need for health packs to heal makes it refreshingly challenging. Overall, wait for the price to drop a little bit, and then give it a go if you're a fan of FPS games/the CoD series!This all being said, it is still a 2017 shooter. Microtransactions are a fairly large part of the game, although you CAN get loot boxes without buying them, it just takes a bit. Not like a Battlefront II amount of grinding, but they don't come too easy either. Also, expect the normal toxicity, annoying tactics, etc. that are inherent in any CoD game."

												SP Review only, rest follows:Campaign was done in 7,6h on Veteran / Söldner.I played it in one session which speaks for the fun i had. But in the end its not on the same WOW level like the Cod 4 campaign, which was something you never saw before back in 2007.Many missions are pretty average, but there was not a single minute i was bored. The Paris and the Ardennen missions were the best. Big + is the focus on 1 guy, his story and his platoon, first time in cod i really did care what happen to my fellow fighters. Its not an oscar winning story, but still a good and entertaining one. Zussman and Red deliver a nice Bromance story. :)KI is ofc on the same dumb level as in all other CODS.Performance is great, never had bugs and run the game on everything smooth on everything max with 80 fps average Full HD, with no drops or anything at all. 1080 GTX user here. Graphics are not impressive compared to games like BF1. But not bad at all, there is always a lot going on and you visit many different locations. But dont expect to many surprising locations, they are well made with a lot of atmosphere but many times i thought i have seen this place before in many other ww2 games. France, Remagen bridge, even Hürtgen forest in Cod 2 for example etc.I only wish the campaign was bigger and focus on the eastern front and the war against japan as well. I mean the game is called WW2, so i thought we see much more locations than in Cod World at War.Is it worth 60€ only for the SP? No. But who buys Cod only for the SP, it was always a good intro for the MP battles.And dont forget the Zombie Modus. I didnt play theese so far.Its not a mindblowing SP, they could have put more locations in the game (like i said russians, japan etc) and the missions are mostly average - if you played a lot of WW2 shooters, dont expect big surprises. But the story around Red and his platoon and the action keeps you playing until the end. I had much fun playing it. I rate it 83/100 for the SP.Lets go online.Edit: Online...: Huge and massive disappointment. The game looks terrible, small maps and almost no love in detail, the maps feel so fake, like you would play on a Paintball arena not in WW2. To be honest it feels even like a step backwards compared to the last Cods...The sounds are strange, fake. Animations look pretty bad for such a huge trippe A title. Gunplay is okay, but doesn't reach the level of MW 1-2 or W@W. + is the new war mode but in gods name it has only 3 maps?!? The other modes are Cod standard. Sledgehammer put but absoluty no love for detail in this Multiplayer. Let me give you examples.When you equip a grip on your gun like the StG 44 it wont be shown in battle or in the menue...wtf is this. Its too much work to model it, this cant be real.Second example. Like in MW Remastered you can unlock new optic for your guns, which change the way it looks pretty hard. The Lee Enfield special variant looks so pathetic, they cut of the barrel alomost complete, look at this:https://www.pic-upload.de/view-34235093/fail.jpg.htmlIn MWR things like that worked, cause of the setting, a golden gun np. But you cant♥♥♥♥♥♥legendary WW2 weapons like this. Its only a small piece why this game is a big let down in MP.I cant believe i spend 60€ on this crap, Cod is finally dead. Lets hope Dice release BF 1944 next year so we can finally enjoy WW2 again. I will test the MP a bit more, but what i have seen so far in a few hours was a not worth the money.Why did Acctivsion gave such an important Cod to Sledgehammer Devs, they made the pathetic MW3 and AW. Huge fails in the Cod series. -_-Infintiy Ward or Tryarch would have made a far better Cod in WW2, im sure. IW made Cod 1, Cod 2 and MW which are known as the best Cod games.Treyarch made atleast one good Cod: World at War. They had experience with the WW2 setting..."

With a business practice like this most of the general public didnt even have a chance to obtain this title. I only purchased this game to play through the zombies easter egg and help find steps. This has shown that treyarch is the only COD developer that should be looked at for the zombies gamemode, at least if u are in it for the easter eggs and the fun of solving them alongside others.I have refunded COD :WWII and i will only pick it back up if this issue differs for later zombies maps created by sledgehammer games"

												Best cod thats been out in a while in my own opinion, there are ups and downs just like any game so ill go over the downs.1.there seems to be no anti cheat just an ability to report players and im not sure if it ever works.2.there are certain outfits/weapons that are basically impossible to get because it is all random, i know people hate buying things in games but if you could use cod points/currency to buy to outfits/weapons you like as well as getting random ones that would be nice. 3.since this new update its been extremely laggy ive talked to others in game and they agree that something is wrong after this update because we didnt have this issue before the update.4.I preordered and bought the season pass and there is another dlc that you have to spend 4.99 on its literally an emblem,calling card, and helmet. i already payed 49.99 for the season pass and they want another 4.99 for these items which i feel if you bought the season pass you should obviously get for free, especially since they gave everyone a map that was exclusive to people who bought the season pass for free.WTF? so in conclusion if you miss the old cod style of gameplay then i would recommend this game even with all these issues i literally only play this game and pubg. bf1 is out of the picture. if you have a problem with hacking as far as aimbots go i wouldnt recommend this game hopefully its something theyre working on but as of now its a big factor thats♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a lot of the community off and they need to implement some sort of anti cheat. ive had people offer to sale me a mod for this game that they wrote for a 50$ steam card and i believe thats what people are doing because they will pay you in steam cards/ games if you ""recruit"" people to buy this mod. idk if this update has fixed what they did or not but i do know that the mod is very real and its something that the devs need to fix because it seems like a lot of people are modding. I have a vac on my account for modding mw2 to the max so i know a mod when i see one. its also why these people tried to get me to buy their mod because of the rep i had. anyway thats enough banter. you will enjoy the game. i almost forgot the zombies on the game is amazing i spend most of my time playing multiplayer but when i play zombies it really kinda brings you back to world at war and black ops 1 its kind of a mixture of the two in the sense of ww2 weapons with a black osp one feel."

												EDIT: Changing my review untill the hackers are dealt with. Great game and feel but the hackers are out of controlAll the people complainging about there fps and everything like that. Maybe its time upgrade your hardware and stop complaining about not being able to run the game. Ryzen 5 1600 4GHZ8GB 3000MHZ RAMGTX 1060 6gbGame runs great at highest settings with some minor stutter to to my lack of system memory.Campaign was fun and a great step up from the last few titles. Multiplay is much better then the last few titles as well. The boxes do not give you guns with stupid stats to get an edge over people but an cool look and a XP bonus per kill.Zommbies is well made and cant wait for the DLC's to come Overall a much better experience then the last few games. Only issue im having is connection issues."

												This is a Multiplayer only review! I have not played the campaign or zombies!Now where do I begin? I ""like"" Call of Duty franchise, they are fun and easy shooters and I have played many from the series. So far I've enjoyed most of them, it's fun to create your own class and select your favourite weapons.In this game however the customization has been dumbed down by removing the vast selection of perks to only one ""basic training perk"", which was a fine new experience at first but now that I have played the game for some time I'm getting bored by the fact that there isn't much you can change. Every match starts to feel the same because of this.The weapons in this game are also not very versatile in my opinion, only smgs can get suppressor, only rifles can get bayonet, etc.. The other cods gave me the feeling that the gun you were using didn't even matter, you could just pick the gun and attachments you like the most and it was a good weapon, in this game there is a clear gap in usability.Other people are also reporting the lack of anti-cheat I haven't seen an absurd amount, maybe 5 in total, guess I'm just lucky. The reason I haven't touched the campaign or zombies is because I've grown tired of the lineair storytelling, I can't grow attached to any of the characters and I just can't be bothered to put time into sitting through it.For zombies it's pretty much the same, I enjoyed it in World at War and Black Ops but after that it got repetitive and boring. The zombies get artificially harder to beat untill they are unbeatable so I never really got into it.In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this game, if you really want a Call of Duty WW2 game I would recommend buying Call of Duty World at War."

												This is a very beautiful game with some great locations and scenery, but on balance I can not recommend this, especially at full price. I found the storyline underwhelming and was surprised and dissapointed that the last mission didn't have you pushing into Berlin. This left the story feeling unfinished. You could also be forgiven for thinking it was only America and Germany in WW2, with little mention of the Allied forces!! Again, this added to the storyline feeling incomplete.I ran this game on an overclocked i56600k with a GTX1080 and it struggled to maintain a steady frame rate.Wait for a sale. 5/10"

												That train wreck scene though... :O #mostensesceneawardTHE BREAKDOWNStoryline: 8/10 I have my bones to pick, but overall was great. Especially with it being about Turner/Pierson. Loved that woven throughout. Leaders impact positively and negatively in more ways than people know. #gotrespect  Though, that spying mission felt tramendously out of place. Almost like a favor to someone on the team to be thrown in the campaign. It's setting/storyline interrupted the flow for me personally. Eh.Setting/Locations: 7/10 Great setting, though the maps, I felt, didn't quite reflect it as well as they could have WWII has always been engrossing and CoD did well in touching if only a dab of its story.Mechanincs/Weapons: 8.5/10 The game handled great for the most part. There were only two missions that made me cringe to the mechanics involved: the tank (ultra high sensitivity at full health, ulta-mega annoyingly unresponsive at low) and the plane (waaaaay too delayed controls--did I mention delayed?) scenes.Graphics/Cut-scenes: 9/10 I mean like, the cut scenes were so stinking gorgeous I can't even remember what the gameplay looks like. #truestoryEnding: 7/10 Abrupt. Like... my goodness. I know you gotta end it, but it took a quick turn in plot/direction and then was at the bottom of its plot-hill in no time (aka: ended). It felt like taking the bridge didn't have as much significance due to feeling like it was a ""oh stink, lets finish this before the game comes out"" moment. I loved the epilogue, though felt like they could have made its tone of seriousness a lot more along the lines of the Zombie DLC. I was hoping they would cross. The camps are gruesome. I realize it's not for all and would significantly affect the rating, but felt the brutality wasn't done justice. Though those ending words... #solidPros/Cons: I loved the missions being only 30-45 minutes. Let's the wife not have to wait all night to hang out, you know? Huge pro. It can also be a con in that it broke of the campaign pretty consistantly. While not a huge fan on all the guns, there are two that I have come to love. Like, truly truly truly seriously love. #cliffhangercomments Main con would be the tank/plane mechanics. Really wish they were improved upon, as those moments were me just ""grinding"" hoping I wouldn't have to replay that part :SOverall: 8.5/10 Solid campaign, phenomenal cut-scenes, and nicely broken up.Needs to be co-op. #likethepcspecsclaimedMULTIPLAYER REVIEWThree shots--torso, torso, head.Die to shovel.Two bayonet stabs (one to the back and one to the front as he's turning around).Die to butterknife.Four shots, torso and up.Die to single fire of single bullet from submachine gun.1/15 makes sense.#somepeopleplayallday #imgonnagobacktowork"

												It's pretty bad.The servers are trash. There's always an annoying bug (like the one that randomly resets reload animations), and this game somehow has way more cheaters than other CoD games do.The weapon variety is lacking too. No revolvers? Minor detail, but it irks me that a WW2 themed game leaves out revolvers and the Mosin Nagant.And don't even get me started on Contracts. They're the only way to get crates without paying money. (The crate drops are also pretty disappointing, even the ""epic"" ones, but that's just what I think)Problem is, they sometimes don't even WORK. I took on two ""get [amount] kills"" contracts at the same time, one for 45 and another for 25. The 45 one was completed, and the 25 one was stuck at THREE for some reason. So basically a kill counter of all things can't even properly be implemented."

												I'll preface this by saying that I haven't played the single-player.. and most of what I'm going to say won't pertain to that aspect of the game.I've spent roughly 50 hours playing multi-player, and for the first couple of weeks, I had a great time.  Especially with the war game mode.  My only complaint with that being that I wish there were more maps/operations.  But when I'm in the mood for a quick break from work, or have limited time, I'll often jump into a round of TDM.  Usually it's not a problem, I have a little fun and get back to doing whatever is I need to be doing.  But over the past few weeks.. it's become more of a frustration.  At first, it was one cheater every so often, but more often than not, I'd just leave the game and find a new one, no skin off my back.  It seems that in the past week all of that has changed.  I'm not one to quickly call someone a cheater or hacker because they're frequently killing me, or better at the game than I am, but this morning, I've attempt to play four rounds of TDM, three of them had people blatantly using an aimbot and/or wallhacks.  Let that sink in.  Three out of four.  75% of the games played this morning where my experience was effectively ruined.If you can get enjoyment out of a game where you'll only have a decent game 25% of the time, then yes, I guess it's worth it.  Or if you plan on using said aimbots/wallhacks, as Sledgehammer doesn't seem to want to do anything about it.But that's not what I payed $60 for."

												At the time of writing this article, being on an MG Turret increases your health too much. Regular guns do too little of damage when snipers one-shot more often than in blackops. Shot gun with Incendiary ammo is the best thing in the game unless you have no way to get up close. Game is a blast in multiplayer and the campaign was a good story but the game will go from like a 3.5/5 to a 4.9/5 if the things prior mentioned get nerfed/buffed."

												SPOILERS - We won.Campaign - 7/10Multiplayer - Toxic/10 as expectedFirst of all, the game looks reasonable but you can clearly see that it's just the same old stuff thrown into a box with some glue. It all sticks together but it looks messy at times. (I know, great example but it's all you need.)The campaign was fairly mediocre. It just plays out as a regular war film would. Not much else to say about that.The multiplayer is actually not as bad as I thought it would be, it's genuinely interesting. I only play War so I can't say anything about S&D and such but i'd expect they'd be the same as always.As you may have noticed, I rate multiplayer at Toxic/10 because of this:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915083http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915106http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915301http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915330http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211915437I think you get the idea by now.Obviously, there's the option to turn chat off but when playing the War game mode, there's often a point where you'll find yourself on a team that knows nothing about objectives. That's normal in CoD, hardly anyone understands what objectives are.Basically, if you want to buy this game, wait til it's on sale and prepare yourself for putting in more effort than usual when playing War.You'll be hated, you'll be slaughtered, you'll feel alone but this is war after all.."

All around good story mode!Multiplayer is good, it definitely needs more work and the map selection is really small (the smallest in the CoD series)! The guns feel nice, although some of them need more balancing. The War mode is the best gamemode that has ever been added to CoD in the past few years.The Zombies mode is amazing,The Final Reich is a really fun map.

												A very good game based on its roots Call of DutyⓇ that came out on 2003 and Call of DutyⓇ 2 (also a pack with both called Call of DutyⓇ Warchest if i am right.), a very good story and nice effects, a few very smart and briliant sentences that show teamwork and some more, a really good zombie mode with multiplayer friendly and quest missions, new class options that wasnt on the previous Call of DutyⓇ games on zombies, perks, levels and weapon modifying. a multiplayer mode with a lot of ranks, weapons, really cool scorestrikes, and a brand new very awsome mode named gridiron which you need to take the ball and drop it in the enemy's glowing circle to score points.I really reccomend this game and also buy the digital deluxe edition if you plan to get a starter pack and a few crates, really cool camo for zombies mode.Tip: if you want your multiplayer always start on zombie mode, go to start options row and type in it: +zombiesMode 1. dont forget to delete it when playing normal multiplayer."

												Much prefer the WW2 gameplay, weapons and overall feel compared to the other series' from COD.  The multiplayer mechanism has been revamped to encourage players to take on a variety of challenges and orders.  This helps players try different classes and types of games.  The headquarters are a nice touch to encourage more people to socialize.  The loot boxes while unpopular with many, they are there as a challenge and extend the life of the game."

Multiplayer i kinda recommend and kinda not because Good side is good maps,fun maps,good guns and all that stuff but down side is that there are alot of hackers. i mean ALOT.. Multiplayer rating 7/10. But still Really fun. But since this game just came out like a month ago still needs some major bug fixes.... FPS still has some drops and all that like micheal bay kinda games.. For right now i have not completed the game because i forgot what misson it is but its like a tank one and stuff... when i flank it goes the same direction i go. and again i go the other way. still follows me. i don't know why its like that. but still like i said still needs some hacker detection. bug fixes all that stuff. i mean how much times have i said all that stuff. yeah i said it like 1000 times. so yeah hope this is a helpful review to you people who want to buy this game, and yeah if you get this game it will ttake a long time to download... takes like 3-2 hours. Really good game since i played this more often too still 9/10. zomebies holy shoot 8289727891278832/10.thank you hope this was  helpful."

												After a long hiatus of Call of Duty (last played CoD was Black Ops) I was pleasantly surprised by CoD WWII, and pleased I took the plunge buying it. Although the campaign is quite short the experience is very rich. Typical WW2 styles missions and objectives, set across the essential sceneryâs that tick all the boxes, they played it safe, but itâs exactly what I was hoping for. Beach landing, check. Clocktower sniper watch, check. Boots on the ground, check.Graphically it can be stunning and performance matched. I was averaging 110fps, fully maxed at 1440p (GTX1080, i7-6700k, 16GB DDR4). In-game cutscenes are especially gorgeous and can sometime be hyper realistic. Music, voice acting and sound effects are all also incredible. Definitely would recommend this game."

												I was so excited for this game to come out, but stopped playing it a week or two after launch. Firstly, the campaign was fun but underwhelmingly short. The first week of multiplayer was lots of fun, but with no anti-cheat systems I swear every second game I play is riddled with hackers. Completely ruins the experience. No point in playing until this gets fixed."

												I purchased COD WWII even though I saw mixed reviews. Not being an diehard of COD, I figured I could be more forgiving than others who were negative. I played Metal of Honor WWII back in the day and absolutely loved it. Comparatively speaking, this game falls short.Bottom line, I wish I did not purchase. The game is very badly done. It wasn't worth my money and it wasn't worth my time. The game is less about WWII and more about a story line about a boy (the main character) and his brother hunting when he was just a boy. Brother defended the boy from getting attached by a wolf and the boy did not have the courage to shoot his gun....with attempts to correlate it to his real-time experience in war.I bought the game for WWII, not for a cheesy story. Very short game, I was done in under 11 hours. I think all of the money was spent trying to create a Hollywood film rather than a video game. And like everyone says, the graphics are poor. I didn't care for the Zombies either....everyone does zombies now days, it is very tired.There were a lot of bugs when I played. Likely they will get fixed, so don't fret too much over the bugs as it was an obvious rushed release."

												To break down what this game's multiplayer is:A point and click adventure disguised as an FPS (aka we won't bother to balance snipers properly so enjoy getting one shot by people you already had multiple bullets in.)A waiting game, in which you get to wait for your spawn to flip for an entire ten minutes unless you're playing Hardpoint. The maps get stale enough to make you believe they've been out since the time period this game's been loosely based on. kiddie casino (though out of all CoD games with lootboxes, this one probably has the best system for earning them. I'll give them that.)Cheater Gaming chair infestationI've played little of the campaign. Seems standard. Might go back and play more in hopes to feel like I had my money's worth. Probably won't be amazing, but something to waste some time on. Zombies is alright, I suppose.Save your money, or toss it in a bin and set it alight."

Multiplayer ReviewHere we are again. That old saying, how'd it go? Another day, another entry into the Call of Duty franchise?I remember when CoD first came out, playing UO on my PC, totally enthralled. I played Descent and AOE for years, and although MoH was probably my first ""realistic"" shooter, CoD was something special. Then CoD 2 hit with the 360. Everyone had it. Every last one of my friends had it, and playing a WWII shooter on Live was awesome; this was back in a time where being able to communicate in real time with strangers all over the world in a video game was still quite new. What a weird community it was. Admittedly, I probably sunk most of my time into Halo 2, but I remember CoD 2 fondly and probably lost a year or two of my life to both of them. Then there was CoD 3. We'll pretend that didn't happen. MW, all bets were off. Hands down the greatest FPS I've ever played and probably will ever play. I know everyone seems to praise MW2, but if you're an OG CoD player, you know that isn't true. WaW was solid, but I remember thinking something felt a little off. Black Ops felt like a step in the right direction, and then MW2 missed the mark, in my opinion. BO2 again missed the mark, and I gave up on the series after that. If this all sounds familiar to you, this newest title is something you ought to be interested in. While CoD: WWII isn't taking us back to the legendary days of MW or CoD 2, it's an excellent attempt. Scorestreaks aren't insanely prevalent or overpowered like they felt in the last handful of titles. There isn't any wall running, jetpacks, or whatever else. This is, honest to Christ, very similar to WaW in gunplay while the game plays very much like a reskinned BO1. There's a nice deal of progression, no pay-to-win mechanics, and an assload of personalization options. As for the folks complaining about rampant hackers, I've only run into two so far at around 15 hours. Even if you do run into one, just quit out and join a different lobby. Not a big deal, and it's nowhere near as bad as these Steam reviews make it out to be. Frankly, I can't understand why this game isn't more popular. Sledgehammer did a phenomenal job in bringing CoD back to its roots, and that's incredibly exciting for me as someone who felt forced to write the whole series off seven years ago. If you miss those original CoD titles, pick this game up. If you still hate it, refund it (and I genuinely believed I'd be refunding it, too). WWII has me pleasantly surprised. I can't believe it. 9/10Edit: It's worth noting that the played time listed next to all reviews here are representative of singleplayer campaign, not multiplayer."

												Erstmal lag es etwa 3 Wochen nur rum in der OVP ( Media Markt) bei mir - hatte mich erstmal umBorderlands 2 was ich ebenfalls am gleichen Tag gekauft hatte gekümmert und nicht bereut:)Hut ab an die Macher von Borderlands 2 - keine Abstürze, kein Ruckeln, logischer Aufbau-ein Game was seines Gleichen sucht seit den letzten 10 Jahren.Wie auch immer, kommen wir zu WW2...ach was solls lange Rede noch länger Erläutert^^Erste Mission - Bunker - Todeskampf = WTF?! Standen doch ebend noch zu fünft da rum- jetzt nur noch zu zweit!!Ich hatte kein Plan was ich da machte, ich drückte iwas in der Hoffnung durch zu kommen - was geklappt hatte - dennoch rall ich es immer noch nicht - vorallem der erste Kampf = drücke F. Und was noch? Wann soll ich F drücken? Wie? alter...das war mir schon echt zu dumm*seufz*Dazu kommt noch diese bescheuerte Flucht, 50 Meter Luftlinie zum Lazarett aber zwischendurch fallen einen etwa 20 Soldaten an - wunder das man hier nicht mit Wurfmessern rumwerfen muss -nebenbei grillt nen Ami fünf Meter nebenan mit nen Flamenwerfer rum..aber ICH muss ohne Deckung von Kameraden ohne Hilfen ohne das da überhaupt jemand von den Amis ist da rumkriechen und das angestochene Schwein ziehen. WTF....Alter, wie behindert künstlich auf die lange Bank geschoben!!! Das geht mal garnicht, ne Junges, ich bin zu alt für so ein Dreck, echt jetzt-.-Bei dem Kampf im Bunker mit der Messerstecherei sah die Grafik nicht besser aus wie damals bei CoD2 - wobei CoD2 für mich heute noch gut aussieht. Am Anfang sah die Grafik echt hübsch aus. Aber bei genauen hinsehen, Fehler so weit das Auge nur reicht wie ""Gras wächst durch ein Wachhäuschen"" oder durch Zäune und Autos""...teilweise matschige Texturen an Wänden.Ja lol ey, zwei von drei Erinnerungen gefunden. OK.NAZI Messer...aha, und warum muss man hier sich das Gefallen lassen NAZI ohne richtiges Symbol dazu!?Ist sicherlich ne Kleinigkeit, aber das hat mich dazu gerührt das Game erstmal zu beenden...hälste im Kopp nicht aus soviel Schmarn auf einmal!?!..WTF...Mensch Leute, ich bin grad mal mit der ersten Mission durch und voll angepisst - wobei noch ganz zu Anfang eifrig dabei war, ja sogar begeistert von den ganzen Intro Videos.Die Steuerung ist Katastropahl. Ein Wunder das eine Tastatur überhaupt ausreicht*facepalm*Man merkt sofort das es sich um eine schlechte Konsolen Portierung handelt - vorallem an der abgrundtief schlechten Steuerung.  Performance grottig.Core i5 3570k@4Ghz / RX580 8GB SpecialEdition@1500/2250 / 8GB RAM Win7 Pro.Für diese*hust* Grafik muss sich mein Rechner so derbst abknüppeln das die Lüfter nur so rotieren da alles nur so aus den Silizium raucht? WTF...ohne Worte meine Herren-.-Ich hatte nach dem gloreichen MW kein CoD mehr angepackt weil alles was danach kam mir zu dumm und kindischer wurde. Ja super, dachte WW2 musste haben, alleine schon wegen der guten CoD2 Zeiten / Lan:) usw halber.Nen scheissdreck brauche ich - klar jetzt werde ich es wohl oder übel durchspielen und mal im MP antesten.Vielleicht sogar länger wie mir lieb ist - kann alles sein - aber mein Gefühl sagt mir einfach - CoD WW2 ist ne totgeburt.Wie ich schon erwähnte, grad die erste Mission fertig und schon angepisst über das Game...unfassbar, das hat echt noch kein anderes Game geschaft, egal wie billig oder schlecht es je Bewertet wurde. Außen Hui - innen Pfui. PFUI!!!Typisches COD abgerichtet auf die 12jährigen Kids...warum man sich überhaupt die Mühe macht für FSK18 bleibt mir ein Rätsel. Machts Blut weg, Beleidigungen raus und wandelt  die obligatorischen ""Hakenkreuze"" in Blumen und ab dafür mit FSK 12...findet bestimmt schnelller und mehr Absatz als dieses künstliche Getue von ""Back to the...""Wäre es wie CoD2 mit der meinetwegen teilweise anschaulichen Grafik jetzt, wäre es ein HIT seines gleichen geworden! Aber so,  ""ja ich habs mal gespielt"" und das wars#verstaubenIch ahne jetzt schon das der Multiplayerteil - ohne ihn gespielt zu haben, viel zu schnell und hektisch ist...sagte ich schon, so wie bei CoD2 wäre es super und mehr Bedarf es nicht!?...Den Machern von CoD WW2 kannste ernsthaft pausenlos nur so was vor die Sabberrinne kloppen...wie kann man so ein Potenzial der technischen Mögichkeiten einfach so verschandeln was Logik, Steuerung und  Performance angeht und die Dreistigkeit besitzen jenes in zig DLCs zu splitten...+ Ingame Micro $ Mangament-.-OfftopicUnfassbar dumm ich bin und es mir tatsächlich geholt hatte - einer meiner schlimmsten Fehlkäufe meine Lebens weil ich einfach mal kein Bock hatte zu zocken und verzweifelt was neues gesucht hatte.Zum Glück lag da noch Borderlands 2 inkl zig DLCs / Bonusmaterial rum in  VOLLWERTIGEN DVDs zum installieren!!!! Das ich sowas überhaupt nochmal erlebe heutzutage.Ein Game zu 99% über DVDs zu installieren..wahnsinn:) Ich werde Borderlands 2 in Ehren halten:) Soviel Spass in kurzer Zeit , ja sogar mit einer LAN:)Davon kann CoD nach MW nur träumen :D Offtopic ENDEGrafik geht halb wegs in Ordnung, Sound meinetwegen auch - wenn auch die Garand nix mit der Garand aus COD2 gemein hat....das mal als Spoiler;) Zu dumpf und man kann sie nachladen...Eurer ernst - echt jetzt?-.-Seit ihr nicht im Stande ein Waffenmodel samt Sounds per Copy and Paste von CoD2 zu übernehmen???rofl xDAber ja doch, mit nen MG42 - wenn auch hier der Sound völlig falsch und weitaus schlechter ist wie bei COD2 - durch die ganze erste Mission rumlaufen hat mir gefallen, echt jetzt - auch wenn mir das schon wieder so derbst dumm war das Feinde zwei Meter vor einem nach einer Salve von 5 Schuss nicht verrecken...natürlich...aber zwei Schuss aus der Garand reichen aus auf  200 Meter...soso..natürlich ich bin einfach zu dumm zum zocken..verdammte Axt aber auch*facepalm*Und wenn man am Strand, selbst auf Rekut nicht aufpasst, haben die MG42 auf einmal Uran High Speed Munition oder wie oder was?????btw ich wusste schon iwie im voraus warum ich Borderlands 2 für 20€ als erstes installiert habe..."

												(This is my first COD experience since BLACK OPS 2 and MW3)(I have over 90 hours in the Multiplayer but for some reason the review says 2.9 which must be campaign)1. Matchmaking system is horrible2. Quite a few hackers 3. Sledge Hammer doesn't listen to their community and therefore does not adjust the game based on what people have said4. Lots and lots of connection issues5. Zombies...even with the nice objectives which do give it a plus, the power up sounds/voices are gone which was a really good part about all other zombies, the characters are sub par compared to the ones from black ops 1 (imo the best zombies experience) The game gets a little repetitive6. The multiplayer is pretty good but it feels as though that 8/10 times I die, the kill cam shows somethging completely different from what I saw (for example, I get the first 1-2 shots off on someone and die.

												I don't know why there was so much negativity about this game, I loved the Campaign and the combat training is awesome, I'm still trying to get used to playing online multiplayer because it doesn't do gamepads any favours with the aiming at all so is so difficult to get a kill ( No Chance I'm ever gonna keyboard it cos it sucks the fun out of any game for me ) ( haters gonna hate) but over all I'm happy with my purchase and have just found the PROPS game mode which is weird and fun at the same time and I love the War modes aswell as it adds extra dimension to MP :)"

												Damn...2008 is back :DSo even if i played this game only 30 hours,i can tell game is pretty lit.There is why this game is good:1.First,personally for me it's very atmospheric to play this game. I played COD 2 and COD WW before and it was f%ckin best times.Still miss it tho.2.Players can choose one out of five divisions, each with their own different basic combat training, division training and weapon skills. This also eliminates perks, as players need to progress through ranks in divisions in order to use additional skills.3,The end-game ""killcam"" highlight shown at the end of multiplayer matches has been changed to ""Bronze Star"", which show kills 4.Even tho Campaing is very short (5 hours play) i love it.There is why i dont like this game:1.So i played 30 hours and it getting boring to play same maps,same modes.2.This game didnt change,game enigne still the same.3.Sometimes game cant even launch.4.Game is doent worth the price.5.Campaing is too short and sometimes boring."

												So, I'm a big fan of COD. The main reason I bought this game is for MP, I suffer a lot in alpha/beta with cheating, but the promise was a full suite will be deployed in the final version. It was a lie, I just play about 35 minutes in war mode and domination mode. AIM Trigger bots all around, impossible to play, I'm so frustrated.............. See, I work with Reverse Engineering, I know how cheats works and I know what I can do to at least minimize the problem. Checking memory states or have everything validate on server site, this is just a lazy thing, the guys from Raven/Activison don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about, they just deploy the simple anti-cheat and it's ok, let's earn money with microtransations. So sad, I was expecting more commitment from Activision/Raven, but it's was not what I receive from this, this getting me anger and frustration. And of course: Bad optimization. I have a good rig with a 1080, the game runs at 45FPS in 1440p on highest settings. But the problem is: The fps drops so much, there is some lagging sometime, stutterings, at least no crashes for me, but I played a little not so much, maybe lucky. It's the same thing again and again and I feel bad for me, because I got caught again in the same way I was caught with Ghosts, Warfare =(I love WWII games, but this game is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.03/12/2017After several improvements I think we are in the right direction on this game.

												so is cod ww2 worth the time and the buy,in my opinion no,and here is why.firstly the game looks ok,graphics are decent,and the controls are snappy,single player is a good story so far but as with the last few cod games i found it a bit meh,same old cod single player exspernce.but if you liked the last couple games then you will probaly like this one.now for the multiplayer,sadly for me this is were i found the game to be at its best and worst,its best because it can be alot of fun,the class system is good and the divisions seem pritty ballanced,its worst because it often lags,quite often the players will be high pings which will lag the match,snipers are so op this year, its harder to find a game were at least 60% of the teams are snipers than not.cheaters,sadly yes this cod is infested with them,you will find in 10 matches at least 8 will have a blaitant cheater or someone who feels very dodgy.all in all the game isnt much fun unless you like getting annoyed because some git has bought cheats and isnt giving a crap because no one is doing anything about them,if you decide to buy this game then i hope you have a better time than me but for me this game is DO NOT BUY"

												I am havinng a lot of fun with this and it was a risk to get on pc. Unfortunately, the game is pretty dead and hacked to all hell. Sledgehammer seems to ignore their PC playerbase and let the hackers run free, not banning or taking care of the problem. For now, I would not recommend getting this games on the PC but that could change in the future. The only modes you can play regularly is Team Deathmatch, War, and Domination. If you are lucky, you can find a game of Free for All or Hardpoint but it is unlikely. So my conclusion is the game is good, although the hit registration seems pretty bad, and if only more players were on PC and hack protection existed, I would recommend this. For now, stick to the console version."

												Side note, If you live in America I would definitely recommend this game, the weapons and leveling system are very intuitive, if you live in Oceania/SEA I would hold off for now, the lack of servers in the region are surprisingly low, unless you can live with 200+ ping on a server on the other side of the world.The game has been out for almost four months now, but there is still a very scarce amount of servers that people from Oceania can actually connect to and play without having 200+ ping. I am yet to play a single game of War on a server that isn't on the other side of the world, same goes with any Hardcore mode. I only occasionally connect to Oceania servers while playing Core TDM. If I want to keep playing the game I am forced to stay in that lobby, no adding new contracts, no ability to prestige, just play till you get bored. This issue happens in solos and parties and yes I have tried changing to Google DNS but I got no where. Anyone who has played an FPS before will see how big of an issue lag really is with peekers advantage, ghost bullets and of course having to lead shots to compensate for lag. I spent $70 on this game and I don't believe that I, along with the rest of Oceania, are being treated as fairly as people in other areas like America. All regions should be treated equally, and I'm fairly sure this issue is happening in other regions too. Stop ignoring this issue and just fix it. And if possible can you show just a small amount of empathy and put yourself in my shoes."

												I would say that this game is bad optimized, but it wasn't NEVER OPTIMIZED! Even respecting game's hardware requirments the game retain an unacepptable performance on my almost 2000$ computer, with the result of random frame drops during all matches (And all this when i choosed into settings the option ""optimize graphic settings""). Turning off the v-sync, and even giving a limit to frames to 60fps the game still have those issues, that mixed with my not so good connection transform the gaming experience into an hellish torture!If you dosen't have atleast a 100 mega connection you will be always bested by everyone who have a superior connection than you, with the result of prefires and not counted bullets on the targhet that will sometimes fudge up you badly into a gunfight.Weapons are pretty bad balanced like every other call of duty. Snipers that dosen't require basic abilities, the default shotgun with an huge range that will ohko you everytime (and it can support incendiary bullets......really?!) and melee weapons that give you an insane sprint out time that will let you one hit kill everything on your way.Some maps are unplayable. e.s: Gustav Cannon (a.k.a the camper realm), uss texas (random sniping and camping into tiny spaces).MY VOTE IS 2 OUT OF 10! Definitely unplayable due the NOT OPTIMIZATION. Other problems are secondary if you can't even play the game without problems. I advise you to don't buy this garbage, since developers dosen't care about optimize their products rather than add new (useless) features."

												Microtransactions aren't too big of a deal (yet) but I fear that'll soon change. Going back to older Call of Duty games you'll realize where they started going wrong. 1.) First of all, the competitive scene is making the game more competitive and less fun. The maps really only consist of three lanes anymore and there's not many things you can do with them. In older games you could navigate through entire buildings rather than having one specific route to follow, you could use bookcases for cover and really use your surroundings to your advantage.2.) Guns + Maps - If you look at Modern Warfare 2 for example, the game released with 16 multiplayer maps and a total of 48 weapons. World War II released with only 10 maps and 31 weapons. World War II will defintely end up with more weapons and maps, you'll just need to spend another $45+ to get something you should've started out with in the first place.3.) Lack of developer support - The developers for these games are just in it for the money these days. The Call of Duty games are not anywhere near as bad as some games *cough* Battlefront 2 *cough* but it's easy to see that they're less interested in making a good game and more interested in giving us a 50% completed game while they slowly work on finishing it up over the next year. 4.) Community - I'll admit that I'm at fault for this too, but the community as a whole isn't very good at expressing or taking actions against these issues. Everyone knows the game is going to be a disaster at launch and for the following month or so, but everyone seems to follow the trend and sigh as they buy the game anyways, knowing the course the game is going to follow. All I'm hoping for is that a developer will eventually start caring more about their fans and less about the money they make. Once that happens, I think the franchise has a chance to be good again. Grenade launchers and shotguns commando were unfair, but they made the games FUN. Taking away all of the annoying little flaws has turned the franchise into a serious and boring waste of time (unless you're good enough to play professionally).This game is a 7/10 gameplay wise and I'd say it's a fair purchase if you really like Call of Duty games and don't mind spending almost double what you originally paid for to get the full experience. I'm not one of those people so I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down until they get their stuff together."

												I was quite sceptical about purchasing this game due to the more recent releases in the Call of Duty franchise being absolute terrible as far as I am concerned. However, I was not disapointed. This game is great to play with friends, especially the zombies mode - best zombies so far in my opinion.The standard multiplayer has some great gamemodes - War is my favourite. The snipers are extremely fun to use. As with all CoDs, the downfall is constant camping from less skilled players. In War this isn't as bad being a heavily objective gamemode requiring some camping in places but it gets really annoying in standard TDM and Domination.For me, one of the great additions to this game that I haven't experienced before is the Headquarters. Great idea. I'm not entirely sure if this was in more recent releases as I played them in BETA and decided not to purchase them but it is a great addition to this game. Daily bonuses, regular challenges, training, and all of the great features it offers. One thing me and my friends enjoy is the crate opening as we can see exactly what people get and the reaction of others when you get 3 legendary drops in a single crate!"

												This game would be so much better if Activision would be more proactive in preventing cheating and hack use. It's a great game, don't get me wrong but the amout of cheating on this game is completely out of line. I didn't pay my hard earned money to play with and against a ton of cheaters that have no clue what actual skill is and how to abide by the Fair Play Policy by circumventing the system by purchasing cheats and hack by websites that have people that break down the code that prevents or is supposed to prevent cheating.

												The game is fun to play. However there is a terrible audio crackling and distortion when playing on my usb audio interface. It's fine when using front panel or on-board audio, but not on my interface. My girlfriend likes to watch the games I play, but does not want to wear headphones. It's the only game I have come across that does this, and I have about 90 games between all my DRM's. I can't recommend this game until the audio issue is fixed.I will edit my review if they ever fix this issue.EDIT 1-1-18: I downloaded a third party ASIO driver that lets me lower the sample rate, bit depth, and buffer size below the studio quality settings my audio interface supports. 44.1 khz sample rate, 16 bit depth, and 512 kb buffer size seem to be what it takes to remove the audio issues. I now recommend this game, but I wish sledgehammer games would have released it with studio quality audio support. Maybe they will fix this with a future patch."

												I think I would really enjoy this game if there weren't so many hackers. It is almost pointless for me to worry about a k/d ratio because of them. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you are just wanting to waste your money. You won't see hackers in every game, but you will run into them. I have tried to report them, but when I go to recent players... they don't show up. I don't know if that happens with all of them, but just a couple I have tried to report. I would rather drink a glass of milk, and poop my brains out because of lactose intolerance than to play this game again. So go ahead, and buy the game.

												TL:DR - Its Call of Duty. Don't expect more nor less. Great campaign, fun multiplayer and insane zombies! Campaign: This time, Sledgehammer decided to go for quality over quantity. Perhaps the shortest campaign in the series, but also one of the best. Character- and story-telling is better than ever.QTE feels a bit cheap, but does not affect the gameplay too much. Overall the best campaign since Black Ops 1.Multiplayer: Server-issues at launch made the game completly unplayable, but they fixed it, and now it runs pretty smooth. Alot of graphical settings, makes the game enjoyable for the most mid-range computers. Finally a game without those insane kill-streaks, such as RC-XD, Dragonfire Drone and Mothership. The HQ might be un-populated at times, but im sure Sledgehammer will find a solution to this issue. Good weapon selection and plenty of unlockables. Overall a great multiplayer experience.Nazi Zombies: This is the fun part! If you ever, just a tiny bit, enjoyed zombies in the earlier cod-games, this is something for you. This time, Sledgehammer did a fantastic job with the zombies, making 'em actually scary. JumpScares will get you at times, so keep that in mind. Some waves also contains smaller boss-fights. Overall the best zombies chapter yet! Overall verdict: If you like the older call of duty-games, without those silly jetpack-things, this is a game for you. Campaign is decent, multiplayer is fun, and zombies is amazing!8.5/10"

												While this game doesn't quite capture the essence of the earlier CoD games, I absolutely belive WWII is a major step in the right direction, as far as gameplay goes. This game knows what it is, and does it pretty effectively. The campaign, I might add, is one of the most entertaining I've played since MW2. The need for health packs to heal makes it refreshingly challenging. Overall, wait for the price to drop a little bit, and then give it a go if you're a fan of FPS games/the CoD series!This all being said, it is still a 2017 shooter. Microtransactions are a fairly large part of the game, although you CAN get loot boxes without buying them, it just takes a bit. Not like a Battlefront II amount of grinding, but they don't come too easy either. Also, expect the normal toxicity, annoying tactics, etc. that are inherent in any CoD game."

Call of Duty: WW2First of all I want to say that this will be an review that will get updated very often!This game runs better then any other single CoD game, very smooth! Butter Smooth, no connectivity issues (people with VPN will encounter that)Map Info9 maps for standard gamemodes3 for the gamemode War1 with SP: CarentanSo now I'll start telling about my opinion so far.CampaignI haven't played it yet, but what people say about Axis using PPSH, I will give a quick explanation.The Axis has fought and won land in Russia, when they shot the soldiers to death they looted their bodies and took the weapons with them. They exported those to the West Front. There they made a few changes to the gun. They have used it against the Alies. MultiplayerThis is where the funs starts, you can do alot more then just playing matches.PerformanceThis game runs butter smooth for me, I don't encounter any problems at all, tweaked a few things in the Graphical settings to make it more smoother then it was before.No lagg, FPS drops or stuttering.Connectivity can be a little bit of a problem for some people. People who use VPN can have it difficult. I reccomend that you use a wired connection for the best. Open up your ports, same ports as any other CoD.HQCoD Introduces you to a new place where peopel can meet others, I really like this idea.Multiple things you can do:- Open loot boxes (people can watch you opening :D) I already ran into little kids screaming around.- Playing shootout with randoms, will earn you some Xp and some ingame currency- Playing a 1v1 match with random classes, I won my first by using rocketlaunchers only :P- Making Emblems, Paintjobs or other things- Gunsmith (Coming Soon)- Mail, here you can get you ingame currency. Every 4hrs you get 100.- Or just some Contracts/Orders. There are many to complete and will give you amazing stuff.Loot BoxesOh no! Here we go again?Nope!Different then before, you can earn them or you try to earn as much ingame currency to get you beloved item. No stat changing weapons. Some xp drops will hapen though like in AW.WarA new gamemode, its an objective and I have played some matches already. The only downside is that there are people that don't know what to do and they just getting kills.I like the operation on Omaha Beach. That one is fun (I'm not gonna tell any spoilers on that)Teamwork is the best!ZombiesAh shiit, doesn't look good? Treyarch simply is the best?Nah mate, I won't say that so often, it's a pretty good mode though.The zombies comes with 2 maps:- Prologue (Introducing you to the story and the characters.- The Final Reich (The real map where all the fun happens)They put alot of effort in it, I still think that this is the easiest zombies I have known. Round 30 feels like round 15 on Origins. But the bosses are really badass on high rounds.Prepare to have alot of Jumpscares too!My Opinion & RatingAs from what I've seen and I have playedThis game is worth you money's. Wait with purchasing SP though!Graphical Rating8/10Gameplay7,5/10Zombies7,5/10Feel free to ask any questions, I'll try to answer them as quick as possible or add me as friend on steam!--Edit 14-12-2017--Not reccomended since cheating is a big issue right now, Sledgehammer is trying to cover it by deleting hack posts on twitter, forums and more.Zombies is also broken, full with bugs...."

												I'll preface this by saying that I haven't played the single-player.. and most of what I'm going to say won't pertain to that aspect of the game.I've spent roughly 50 hours playing multi-player, and for the first couple of weeks, I had a great time.  Especially with the war game mode.  My only complaint with that being that I wish there were more maps/operations.  But when I'm in the mood for a quick break from work, or have limited time, I'll often jump into a round of TDM.  Usually it's not a problem, I have a little fun and get back to doing whatever is I need to be doing.  But over the past few weeks.. it's become more of a frustration.  At first, it was one cheater every so often, but more often than not, I'd just leave the game and find a new one, no skin off my back.  It seems that in the past week all of that has changed.  I'm not one to quickly call someone a cheater or hacker because they're frequently killing me, or better at the game than I am, but this morning, I've attempt to play four rounds of TDM, three of them had people blatantly using an aimbot and/or wallhacks.  Let that sink in.  Three out of four.  75% of the games played this morning where my experience was effectively ruined.If you can get enjoyment out of a game where you'll only have a decent game 25% of the time, then yes, I guess it's worth it.  Or if you plan on using said aimbots/wallhacks, as Sledgehammer doesn't seem to want to do anything about it.But that's not what I payed $60 for."

												I would say that this game is bad optimized, but it wasn't NEVER OPTIMIZED! Even respecting game's hardware requirments the game retain an unacepptable performance on my almost 2000$ computer, with the result of random frame drops during all matches (And all this when i choosed into settings the option ""optimize graphic settings""). Turning off the v-sync, and even giving a limit to frames to 60fps the game still have those issues, that mixed with my not so good connection transform the gaming experience into an hellish torture!If you dosen't have atleast a 100 mega connection you will be always bested by everyone who have a superior connection than you, with the result of prefires and not counted bullets on the targhet that will sometimes fudge up you badly into a gunfight.Weapons are pretty bad balanced like every other call of duty. Snipers that dosen't require basic abilities, the default shotgun with an huge range that will ohko you everytime (and it can support incendiary bullets......really?!) and melee weapons that give you an insane sprint out time that will let you one hit kill everything on your way.Some maps are unplayable. e.s: Gustav Cannon (a.k.a the camper realm), uss texas (random sniping and camping into tiny spaces).MY VOTE IS 2 OUT OF 10! Definitely unplayable due the NOT OPTIMIZATION. Other problems are secondary if you can't even play the game without problems. I advise you to don't buy this garbage, since developers dosen't care about optimize their products rather than add new (useless) features."

												Side note, If you live in America I would definitely recommend this game, the weapons and leveling system are very intuitive, if you live in Oceania/SEA I would hold off for now, the lack of servers in the region are surprisingly low, unless you can live with 200+ ping on a server on the other side of the world.The game has been out for almost four months now, but there is still a very scarce amount of servers that people from Oceania can actually connect to and play without having 200+ ping. I am yet to play a single game of War on a server that isn't on the other side of the world, same goes with any Hardcore mode. I only occasionally connect to Oceania servers while playing Core TDM. If I want to keep playing the game I am forced to stay in that lobby, no adding new contracts, no ability to prestige, just play till you get bored. This issue happens in solos and parties and yes I have tried changing to Google DNS but I got no where. Anyone who has played an FPS before will see how big of an issue lag really is with peekers advantage, ghost bullets and of course having to lead shots to compensate for lag. I spent $70 on this game and I don't believe that I, along with the rest of Oceania, are being treated as fairly as people in other areas like America. All regions should be treated equally, and I'm fairly sure this issue is happening in other regions too. Stop ignoring this issue and just fix it. And if possible can you show just a small amount of empathy and put yourself in my shoes."

												Despite it's return to its roots to the Second World War, CoD:WWII is one of my least favourite FPS. The campaign is too linear and not interesting compared to other CoD campaigns. Multiplayer was quite balanced and the Division System is a good idea. War mode is also surpirsingly fun and exciting. In spite of this, MP is too random and unpredictable. It is frustrating when you just keep on getting hit markers and not killing the enemy.Although CoD:WWII is somewhat fun and graphically awe-inspiring, the campaign's linear playstyle and the randomness of the MP puts off my experience. You'd be better off getting Black Ops 2 or Modern Warfare if you want a boots on the ground experience."

												its actully not terrible i honestly enjoy the multiplayer, but zombies isnt like it used to be i guess. in a perfect world you would have WWII multiplayer and BO2 or BO3 zombies. ps the story mode actully has a decent story so id give it a high 7 or a low 8."

												Multiplayer:- mediocre MP maps, so you have to buy DLC to get better maps- mediocre colors & contrast- worse positioning audio than other games- hitregistration is a complete joke, by the worst of all times- damage is at random- no teambalancing, nor in skills, nor in numbers: 6 generals vs 1 sgt ... congratulations- bad mapbalancing- bad server-client structure- sniper-fanboy game, with 1000mm bullets, to be sure to hit 2 ppl next to eachother, not behind eachother, with 1 shot- ridiculous OP pistol damage in relation to other weapons...probably coz it is the sniper's second weapon- most cheat-friendly game: no anti-cheat, cheaters are allowed and snipers are served to be able to shoot while starting to aim, but not really aiming, coz they are allowed to aim with an artificial crosshair, to get 1 shot to kill in all circumstance, using the sniperrifle as a shotgun...there are ways to avoid that, but the devs choose not to...- smoke seems to be personal: A cannot see B, but B can see Aand this is a Triple A game and costs 60€... by far not enough quality for the price !!!!"

												This game is fun to play but it is riddled with so many problems that have apparently been present since day one and activision has done exactly nothing about most of these big issues that allot of people have. issues range from lag spikes for no reason, to literally not being able to launch the game. Its a shame cause i was really excited to play a ww2 cod again as i have fond memories of playing world at war back in the day."

												Honestly, it's a really goof game.Campaign is a bit short, but it has such a great story. It's a story about brotherhood and how the team watches out for one another.Multiplayer can be a bit frustrating at first. Yes, it's almost impossible to get kills, because you have to get used to the game. I've been playing for over two weeks and I already got the hang of it. No, there won't be any futuristic guns and double jumping because it's WWII. I love the range of guns and the customization varieities. Overall, it was worth every buck. I first got the standard edition for $60, and I loved it so much that I bought the season pass for another $50."

												I honestly feel like people were expecting too much from this game, no offense Sledgehammer, it's not your fault. When Call of Duty said they were going back to their roots, everybody was expecting it to be perfect, and just like WaW, and I feel that those people didn't take this game for what it was. And some people now are criticising the game fore being a clone of WaW.  There is no appeasing the masses nowadays.  This game, compared to the other recent Cods, had a nice, short, and straightforward campaign. I feel it was nice for them to step away from criptic storylines that were great, but diffucult to crack or follow.  As for multiplayer, I haven't run into any problems with cheating. Everyone is playing fair. The waepons have a good balance, and don't take much effort to master. There are still supply drops, but missions to earn extra weapons are plentiful, and are renewed as neccesary. Zombies was an entirely new experience, with some same attributes. The round system pairs well with random zombie encounters, though it's a *little* difficult to tell which zombie is the last one if you've encountered one randomly. The Pack-a-Punch was easy enough to get to, and the main easter egg is fun to attempt solo.      Overall, this game is great compared to not just recent Cod games, but recent GAMES in general. If you have the money, I would purchase this, just for the lighthearted Cod experience. Thank you for reading. If you have any more questions before you purchase this, then comment, and I'll see what I can do to help. ^-^"

												Review Edited.Review is for multiplayer only.Possibly one of the worst COD games released.Now its full of nothing but dual pistols and cheap incendiary shells.Atleast for me the game ran, and played better at launch. My bullets seem to just disappear in thin air, most kill cams don't even show me shooting, yet I got atleast 3 or 4 hit markers on my screen, the TTK is insanely high.Pass on this game. This is coming from someone that previously gave the game a good rating."

												I was super excited to see this game when it was first announced that I pre-ordered right then and there. It's honestly one of the best Call of Duty games since Call of Duty 3. The multiplayer is extremely fun and there aren't a ton of perks to figure out. It's pretty basic. The only thing I have a major complaint about is the fact that it seems like you run into a hacker nearly every game of whatever you play. You'd think that with the release of every CoD game, they'd change the coding to make it harder to hack. But ah well. I personally really enjoy this CoD. If you're looking for a great CoD game again, then this is the one! It's pretty gorey. It's freaking amazing. The single player is also pretty fun!"

												Hey there SoliderI'm here to tell you why you should or shouldn't join this war.The game is great, you ask why? let me tell you.Gameplay is smooth and on the ground, so throw that old stupid exo-skeleton away, you dont need that here.You need a weapon, well we have a good arsenal of that right here. If you want to be fast and flanky, then grap the airborne division and a smg and get out there and flank thoes mofo's.If you wanna be aggressiv and turn your opoments to bonfires, choose the expeditionary division and grap a shotgun, put some incendiary shells in it and see you enemies become bonfires.You wanna camp? hey not everyone wants to run around like a headless chicken. Grap an LMG from the armored division, mount it somewhere and let it rain lead on your enemies.If you are for the rifle type? we got the right ting for you, infantry is the division for you, Auto or semi? we got both so if you want to equip your self with and STG-44 and unleas hell, you can do that but if a M1 Garant is more you we got that too.You wanna be steady and not a fan of close or even medium distance fights? mountain division is for you, Grab a sniper rifle and find a good spot, take a deep breath and let the helmets fly. Last but lot least, we are currently looking for recruits for the resistance division, in this you'll mostly be using your pistol, but you will always have a knife with it, os get out ther and stap thoes germans and help us win this war.The only bad thing about this war is alot of soilders that you will encounter are extreme in languange and will blame you for their own lack of skill."

BUT...........................................>The REAL extended mazine on the P08/09 Luger had 30 plus rounds, NOT 12 (it's a drum magazine, should add more  then 5 rounds)>The PPSH/Tokarev (same round) has more knock down and penitration then a 9mm (P38/MP40)>They need to speed up the fire rate on ""Hittler's Buzz Saw"" the MG42>The soviet 40 with a 2ft long magazine only adds 5 rounds, but it is 4 times the size>They got rid of the Swastika's to avoid offending people (IT""S WORLD WAR 2, History)>Where are the Japanese???

												It's ok. I think it has a good foundation. The guns are fun, the gameplay is fun, but there is a couple of issues that hold it back from me whole heartedly recommending it.1) The Create a Class Division system is awful. You only get 1 perk slot unlike the three before. Not only that, but you can only pick one grenade. Not one tactial and lethal, but one greande overall. This is really limiting and does not make it fun.2) The taunts are terrible. Some of the taunts you can do are literally repeated under a different name. This is lazy and incompetent. Make unique taunts. We don't need 10 taunts repeated 300 times. We would rather take 20 taunts that are all unique.3) The campaign is too short. The campaign is really fun, but it is definetly the shortest one I have played so far. 5 hours and I was constantly rushing the enemy and dying. If I actually tried to survive, it would have taken me even less time.4) The maps. These maps are absolutely terrible. All 3 lane garbage like if this was a Moba. This isn't a moba. This is a shooter. The maps need to be more open. I hope the next COD fixes these issues. There is a good game buried underneath a myriad of issues. I wish there was a neutral option, but for now, I would only try it if you are a hardcore COD fan or are itching a new WWII shooter and have already played Red Orchestra 2 and Day of Infamy."
